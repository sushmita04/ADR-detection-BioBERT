1,i have taken tegretol in it various forms for over 10 years about 5 years ago i started to complement gabapentin to control the tn pain the dosing through the years has varied at times to address the degrees of pain i experienced two years ago i was under a tremendous amount of stress after my moms first stroke i must have been taking 3 times the maximum dose for tegretol 3600mg and at or more than 4800mg of the gabapentin per day for 3 weeks needless to say by the end of the third week i had experienced an atrioventricular heart block and needed to be medivaced to a hospital and 5 days later now have a pacemaker at the time i honestly did not know that i was over dosing on the medications i wanted to simply control the tn pain i do not know conclusively that the medications caused the block and ultimate heart failure but it is something to be aware of i am thankful i wasnt alone that night when this occurred i simply would have went to sleep and would not be posting this now the epitol works wonders for the painand i have been very aware since my experience dosing and thresholds of pain tolerance,"pain, stress",1
2,took carbamazepine for 11 years for seizures i was on extended release 200 mg morning and at night and had seizures when highly stressed it was increased over the years and never stopped seizures when i had a grand mal seizure with a one hour unconsciousness and in er then referred to a new doctor increasing the meds never stopped seizures and a brain lesion on mri was discovered and removed to stop seizures the meds gave me side effects of decreased memory balance problems and lethargic my speech became slurred too and could not recall needed words for conversation it has caused my tongue dystonia where i have no control and constantly licking my lips embarrassing i no longer take this medication and no longer side effects except for dystonia,dystonia,1

32,i was dagnosed with bipolar i cannot remember if it is 1 or 2 have been on tegretol for only one week my thoughts appear to be clear i have no thoughts of suicide i do however feel a litte unsteady on my feet i hope this will pass i had been on lithium for five years along with lexapro too many side effects from lithium that is why the dr switched me to tegretol i sure hpoe it works,suicide,1
33,ive been taking tegretol er for over 2 years now for bipolar i after having no success with lithium too toxic or depakote the zombiemaking weightgain pill i think tegretol is great ive had no breakthrough mania while taking it also tegretol has brought excellent stability to my moods with very few side effects at first i had headaches and was pretty sleepy but that has gone away completely i gave it 9s not 10s only because tegretol is not sufficient to stabilize my mood 100 we had to add a very low dose of geodon to round it out also it doesnt seem to have any antidepressant properties so i also need to take a mediumsized dose of lexapro allinall i think tegretol does an excellent job making me feel solid and even without dulling me out or making me tired even at a very high dose i dont have that heavily medicated feeling,mania,1
34,it served its purpose but made me too tired all the time i was taking this drug i had no idea how relaxed and layed back i had become i want willing to do anything that took any effort what so ever not that i could a lot of the time but there were times i could have got back on my feet if i were not half sleeping all the time it did stop most neurological pain most of the time it was never 100 but what is i would never start this again i would prefer the pain after quitting within a week or so i started getting back the fight i use to have in me i am a lot better off now for stopping the use of it it just seem to make me into a sombie that doesnt mean it would for anyone or everyone else as we can all see all the drugs work great on some and not at all on others i would recommend trying it but also watch for symptoms of sleepiness lazy careless and so on if you begin to lose your desire to fight on quit the pills dealing with ms one needs all the fight they can get not a drug that knocks the fight out of you,pain,1
35,whilst on carbamazipine i was stable at the age of 22 i discovered i had polysystic ovaries and was supposdly infertile no periods i was stable on carbomazipine but if i missed a dose i would take a grand mal side effecti only have partial at thirty i discovered i was pregnant my son was born with a complex heart condition after reconstuctive surgery he is as fit as any other child after birth i decided i wanted to change my meds due to these effects however after several trials i have decided carbamazipine is better suited to me young women and bearing aged women need to aware of these side effects otherwise a good drug careful with dosage as to much can knock you of your feet literally,surgery,1
36,works very well so far i began this treatment about 11 days ago for bipolar of which i suffer from quite severely and it is working very well i did have an awful headache for the first 5 days but i weathered through and its gone and i am quite in control of myself at least moreso than before i can talk myself out of anxiety attacks more effectively and i can focus on things i need to accomplish much more than i ever could i even left the house to go to a store albeit for 5 minutes and accompanied by my husband but still i did not expect it to have any effect on my approach to my own anxiety problems as it is not normally used for that i am pretty excited about this medication wish me luck,"anxiety, headache",1

38,made matters worse i was prescribed this med for a nasty irritable racing thought reckless driving hypomanic episode it did one thing made me drowsy enough to calm me down and sleep sleep sleep it increased my binge eating when i was awake especially for junk food it made my irritability worse to the point of feeling homicidal thats when i stopped taking it i had broken sleep an increase in depressivesuicidal thoughts and an increase in repeating thoughts really annoying i would read things over and over and repeat things in my mind that people said or i heard over and over one of the worse of the 24 meds so far that have been tried to control my moods im bipolar i borderline ocd currently bipolar depressed,"binge eating, irritability",1
39,pain free anyone who has felt that horribly sharp jutting pain shooting up from your tooth toward your scalp definately wants relief went to the dentist 1st who had no recommendations my neuro said it is tri neuralgiai forget the 1st word med was is quite effective for me but makes me sleeeeeeeeeepy so i take 1 2xday and only take the rest if i need them which is hardly ever fortunately i only experienced this in the left upper quadrant of my facecould not even touch my hair neuro suggested i reduce meds from time to time as condition can resolve itself perhaps i will try just one pill and see what happenswish me luck,pain,1
40,good i was taking it together with rivotril 05 grams a day together with a multivitamin and i think it worked generally speaking at first i was prescribed 1200 mg a day and at 2 different dates a few months a part i had double vision upon consultation with my neurologist she referred me to an opthalmalogist based on the results of the examination my neurologist decided to decrease my dosage to 1000 mg a day but still take the other medicines i was talking i had an experience wherein in the entirety of experiencing around 12 seizures while asleep without walking up for the entirety of one yearmy wife informed me of the event when i wake up in the morning concerned where i feel some fatigue i later transferred to another neurologist who placed me into tegretol but at a lower level first at 800 mg a day and later at 400 mg together with keppra and where i experience the virtually the same number of seizures partial though they all transpired daytime for one year and one grand mal sleepiness andor fatigue and anxiety are what i also may say as side effects of the medicine i was taking,"anxiety, fatigue",1
41,the xl was a better med for me less side effects it appeared to work but there were some side effects primarily memory loss the xl seemed to fit the remedy better after 8 years the effectiveness seems to be lessening,memory loss,1

43,epilepsy medications tegretol works great for me right tempral lobe damaged during birth i wasnt diagnosed until i was 32 years old and suffered from petite mal seizures for as long as i remember then my husband saw me having a grand mal seizure in my sleep that explained why i would wake up with bruises generic tegretol does not work for me the fillers use up the active ingredient at a faster rate than the brand name thus putting me under medicated i was taking the maximum dosage at that time now using brand name tegretol i was able to cut my morning dose by half but still continue to take 600 mg at night because i figure if i get grand mal seizures in my sleep i might as well not cut that dose its worked great for the last 27 years im 59 years old at present,epilepsy,1
44,tegretol i find tegretol to be a very useful in keeping my seziures at bay i like the fact you can check your blood for your levels to make sure you have a consistent level at all times tegretol combined with other drugs is an unbeatable combination,,0
45,excellent this was excellent medication for seizures while taking i did not have one seizure however amalze increase and came off then had seizures with keppra,,0

50,horrible side effects i started out taking 100 mg twice daily and then moved up to 200 mg twice dailymy first symptom was sore lymph glands under my arm i thought i was getting a flu or cold then i began to get these tiny blisters all over the palms of my hands my feet also started to become affected i then noticed i just felt sick like a constant flu and very sleepy i believe i was having a allergic reation to the drug and stopped taking it as slowly as i could my hands have started to clear as well as my feet i have to see my doctor to see what we will try next,,0

52,worst experience for my son my son was put on tegretol and by the middle of the second week he could no longer stand by himself if he tried to walk or run he fell one time ryan just walked away from his toys and he fell so hard he cut his lips i called the dr that is when we put him on keppra even with the terrible side effects the seizures just kept coming,,0
53,loss of sex drive since i have been on tegretol i have not had a seizure which has been over 4 years i have had the usual side effects such as weight gain 80lbs tiredness dizzyness but the one side effect that has pretty much ruined my relationship with my girl freind is my loss of libido i contribute this to the fact that my testosterone is now way lower then it should be i have found a study online that was done on rats the study said that the rats being given high doses of tegretol had a significant reduction in testosterone and sperm count has anybody else experienced these problems ,loss of libido,1
54,first seizure medication increased then changed i was prescribed tegretol after suffering my first grand mal at the age of 32 which baffled everyone none of the scans showed anything i had also experienced partials over the previous year but didnt realize what they were i literally could not read and had a very short attention span for brief periods i was told that tegretol was considered a good first try medication it has been around awhile good track record and a good way to gauge what may work best for me for the first year i was on a starter dose 100mg three times a day the partial sezures were reduced somewhat the dosage was increased to 200mg 3xday to try to eliminate those which helped further i did have another grand mal about two years later so the thought was that another medication would be more beneficial rather than increase the dose as far as side effects i was initially very drowsy for the first month or so even at such a low dose but this diinshed as i became accustomed to the tegretol i did gain weight water retention which was new to me as a man and that did not change throughtout my usage my neurologist was very frank with me they really dont know how most of these medications work so trial and error is a part of the treatment process this has helped me keep perspective and be observant of changes,water retention,1
55,a low down dirty shame that im allergic after three years of depressive mixed states i thought id finally found the med in tegretol it was amazing it was pretty much good for virtually every aspect of my mental state including motivation drive confidence most importantly i could finally feel genuine emotions happiness sadness etc the tegretol basically stopped the constant feelings of being overwhelmed aggitated andor beat down but as i raised the dose i noticed itching and irriation of my ears nose throat eyelids and even my urethra sorry for tmi as if this wasnt evidence enough of an allergic reaction my liver enzymes got way elevated so my pdoc is having me discontinue im down to 200 mg now and i already feel the scary darkness creeping back in its such a shame to have gotten just a taste of what feeling okay might be like before getting yanked back onto the medgoround again from what i understand allergic reactions are pretty uncommon and can almost always be caught with careful monitoring i think this drug should be prescribed more commonly for bp but maybe pdocs dont like the extra effort involved with the bloodwork,,0
56,not for me so nausea i couldnt stand up to go to work i had to stop taking it,nausea,1
57,not any better than trileptal if not worse my son became manic on long term lexapro an ssri for his ocd behaviors and trileptal seemed to have worked to control that from june to dec of 2005 winters are very hard for my 6 year old and he gets completely out of control with ocd and the higher the ssri the more manic he becomes in addition to being ocd we switched to tegretal which is the more muscular cousin of trileptal and not only saw no changes but also he became ravenous and gained weight the doc told us to up the dose but that did nothing what worked was getting into late spring and also switching to abilify i have to wait until next winter to see what abilify will do for us then,,0

79,this is the one that works for me gran mal epilepsy popped into my life in 1978 while in college first med i was put on was dilantin side effects such as shortterm memory loss were problematic especially for a graduate student so i switched to tegretol in 1982 once on the proper therapeutic dose i have been essentially seizure free there was one breakthrough in 1988 when i was ill and on other meds that compromised the tegretol i shifted to the extended release formula which made it more convenient the main negative with tegretol xr is that it causes abnormal liver enzyme levels for a period in 2003 tegretol xr was in short supply and it became difficult to get a supply of the pills without frequent trips to the pharmacy because of my excellent seizure history we my neurologist and i thought it might be a good opportunity to try one of the new epilepsy drugs one that promised equal seizure control without the same load beign placed on the liver trileptal was in the same family as tegretol but promised to be a kinder gentler drug on the liver i made the switch to trileptal without incident and on my next blood text my liver enzyme levels were normal over the next months however i began to experience side effects and then there was a gran mal seizure the first one in 16 years after doing tests to make sure there was nothing else going my doctor and i decided that trileptal was the wrong drug i switched back to the tegretol xr this is the one that works for me curiously it is now in plentiful supply drug tegretolxr dose 600 mg 3 x 200mg taken bid with breakfast and dinner,"epilepsy, memory loss, shortterm memory loss",1

82,tegretol works for a lot of people but not for me i was on tegretol for a long time and i found the side effects to be terrible i couldnt sleep was constipated all the time my hair was falling out like crazy and i was having these terible mood swings after i got off of it everything went back to normal in my life,mood swings,1
83,tegretol i was always having periods of being extremely tired after taking tegretol i hated that now that i am on carbatrol which is time released i dont get that tired feeling anymore it is a definite improvement,,0
84,worst of the worst it does not get any worse than this drug xr or regular the side effects are horrible dilantin a step above depakote er a mile above,,0
85,weirdest side effect ever i used tegretol generic in addition to lexapro to stabilize my agitated moods as i emerged from a bad depressive phase apparently in a very small number of patients using this drug a side effect occurs that causes problems with word retrieval if youve ever experienced a word being on the tip of your tongue imagine being like that more or less all the time and the word that might be on the tip of your tongue could be something like phone or dinner plate its a very weird feeling especially for someone like myself who does a great deal of writing at work this side effect is enough to cause imediate discontinuation of the drug my psychiatrist agreed and weve now switched to lamictal which works better although is still not sideeffect free,,0
86,worked well for me for years i took 1000 mg a day of tegretol for a decade with no ill effects i also took 15 mg of klonopin for anxiety and this was all i took during this time and it worked well until i was later switched to depakote seroquel and klonopin,anxiety,1
87,how is your libido this drug is very cheap but outdated compared to new drugs keppra lamictal i was on tegretol for 20 years low dose 200mg twice a day and never had another generalised seizure in all that time however it did not stop my partial seizures so i had frisium clobazam for those both drugs had longterm sideeffects but i didnt see the connection until i came off them i have had problems for the last five years or more with eczema on my hands and hairline and it disappeared when i stopped the clobazam six months ago i then started lamictal and reduced the tegretol when i got the tegretol down to 200mgday i was staggered to rediscover my sexdrive overnight i had gradually lost all interest in sex ten or more years ago and had no idea that it was tegretol that had switched me off has anyone else experienced anything like this the risk is that it is too embarrassing to talk about but dont we have a responsibility to warn each other about even the sideeffects we consider unmentionable even the medical profession is too embarrassed or ignorant to tell us about it so maybe we should ask more probing questions and certainly report all sideeffects we discover what if lamictal has a similar effect after several years,"eczema, partial seizures",1

91,just before my brain surgery my doctors prescribed this drug knowing there was a very small chance id ever react but we should try anyway i had been on every other drug except that little to say it did zero and i of course had to still have phenobarbital in my system along with it or i would seize big then side effects with that medication werent as bad as others i have taken and after going through the real rough ones such as lamictal was with me i can take anything and not be in despair god has blessed me and made me strong not to ever vomit from anything he knows i will flip out i got an abnormal gait slurred a few words in the beginning memory wasnt fabulous but in this situation i was on phenobarbital and that drug fries memory from the moment the single pill goes down your throat i had a bit of weight loss i do believe from this drug from feeling sick to my stomach so i did not eat very much otherwise i wasnt on it long enough to ensure what it will be like in the long run it is one drug that i took prior to surgery both of them so if in fact i should need to try one last thing before the rns this is the last one sincerely heather j coburn,"feeling sick, surgery",1

94,parents be careful i was diagnosed with epilepsy during my freshman year in high school i had always excelled in my studies however once i was put on this drug i suddently felt like my brain stopped working i felt like i had been sedated i couldnt handle not being able to think do well in school so i didnt end up taking tegretol for very long it didnt seem safe i would recommend being careful when taking this drug pay attention to the performace of yourself and or child i am now taking lamictal and i have not felt any of these side effects i had the same memory performance problems with depakote and topamax,epilepsy,1
95,carbatrol user carbatrol seems to have fewer side effects than tegretol or even tegretol xr it has a different release mechanism than the xr variety each capsule releases medication 3 times during the day in small doses the effectiveness is reported to be greater with fewer sides ive been taking this drug in combination with lamictal for nearly 7 years without many major incidents i suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy left sided and the drug cocktail seems to work for me of course everyones seizure disorder needs to be discussed with their own physicians for a personalized plan of seizure intervention just remember there are seizure experts in the us and most likely in other western countries sometimes seeing a general neuorlogist isnt enough however jumping from a general neourologist to a neurosurgeon can be premature i am not a doctor please do not infer anything i stated as medical advice,epilepsy,1
96,tegetrol i was diagnosed with epilepsy when i was 12 years old one thing that it has affected it jobsworking i am trying to get back into the job market and just turned down a good paying job because i got scared of how my epilepsy would be if i worked shifting between 2 shifts changing every 2 weeks also the driving thing i have never had my drivers licence but finally got permission from my neurologist and our provincial drivers board then i saw a neuropsychologit and he said no in his report i could use some advice from other epileptics out there about this since i am not sure what to do,epilepsy,1
97,tegretol xr i was diagnosed with epilepsy 3 years ago and put on 400mg of tegretol xr i was seizure free and my levels were at the low end of theuraputic this dosage left me with little to no short term memory depression and an inability to work i am a ceo of a company against doctors advice i reduced my dosage to 200mg twice a day one year ago and have had an incredible improvement i have been seizure free for over 3 years my advice is even if you are seizure free but the side effects make your life horribleyour medication is not working do something change meds or doctors but insist on finding your cure do not lose hope and demand that you feel good not just seizure free,"depression, epilepsy",1
98,tegretol did nothing for me like lithium and the other bp drugs i tried after 6 months or so of the tegretol i stopped using it had no effect on me at all i wondered if it was a placebo it had no side effects either that i can remember except subirn light senetivity at times what as waste of time and money,,0
99,carbamazepine generic i used to take tegretol however when i went back to school and was without medical insurance i opted for the generic carbamazepine carbamazepine is inexpensive i pay around 30 for 3 months 270 pills at costco one does not need to be a member to purchase prescriptions there when i first began taking carbamazepine i experienced severe nausea and upset stomach however upon establishing myself on the medicationthose symptoms disappeared now i experience nausea on occasion especially a few days before my period also if i try to process thoughts too quickly or too many thoughts at once my mind goes blank and i lose focus of what i was talking about a few seconds and my thoughts return i wish a timerelease carbamizapine was offered taking my meds 3 times a day 8am 3pm 10pm i often forget to take my meds in the middle of the day not good,"nausea, upset stomach",1

101,tegretol 400 cr i have been using tegretol 400 cr for a year now and find it great i have had epilepsy since i was 12 and am now 38 previously i was taking tegretol 200 but was taking 2 tablets 3 times a day i used to feel lethargic and light headed more times that not since taking the tegretol 400 cr which i take 1 tablet 3 times a day i not longer feel lethargic or light headed i feel very confident epilepsy is one of those conditions that you know you have to live with so preventing any seizures is wonderful,epilepsy,1
102,no more insults i use tegretol for more than 15 years now insults stopped but still have partial seizures tried every other medication but this is the best on the long term dot not know about the side effects anymore but without tegretol insults come back,partial seizures,1
103,tegretol xr i have complex partial seizures with right sided mesial temporal sclerosis tegretol was only partially effective for first 6 months seizures returned with a vengeance about 6 months into using tegretol xr side effects included sleepiness extremely reduced congnitive functioning and depression finally had doctor take me off after i fell down an escalator having seizure moved to zonegran and felt better immediately although longterm it lost its effectiveness too,"complex partial seizures, depression, partial seizures",1
104,couldnt function on tegretol tegretol was the first medicine that they put me on when i was diagnosed with epilepsy in 1995 i could hardly function within an hour of taking it i was so tired that i would fall asleep while sitting up i didnt stay on it long enough to see whether or not it was effective,"epilepsy, fall",1
105,dont use this drug i was on it for awhile and i gained 60 lbs on this when i was younger like 11 dont take it and dont let your kids take it,,0
106,not for me i took the generic form of this drug for three weeks for the first week i slept for 14 hours a day and was barely functional my doctor reduced the dose and i slept less and felt well and very stable but after two weeks i came out in the most horrendous rash from head to toe i had swollen glands in my neck and underarm and was very unwell indeed i put on two kilos around 5 pounds in three days despite not eating much as i felt to sick after treatment with an antihistamine the rash stopped developing but didnt go away so we stopped treatment and the rash started to fade i lost the weight and started to feel a little better after a few days this was very disappointing as i cant take depakote because i am already overweight and my doctor wont try lithium because i already have a thyroid condition so im now once more without a mood stabilizer just my effexor and sarting to cycle again i really did feel so much better very quickly emotionally and my mood was stable for all of the three weeks back to the helter skelter,"rash, unwell",1
107,not amazing took this for a few years had to start taking antidepressants while on it though seroxat main problem i found with it was it affects your circadian rhythm ie your sleepwake cycle i was going to bed at 2am and sleeping in the afternoon every other day which i wouldnt normally do quite effective only trouble was i couldnt do fulltime work on it and the two times i tried stopping it i relapsed almost immediately quite badly,,0
108,tegretol xr i find tegretol xr great since it is quite effective and i dont feel any side effects,,0
109,tegretol good for agoraphobia in lower dosages i used to use tegretol xr for a suspected partial seizure problem likely misdiagnosed from panic disorderagoraphobia however in the late 1990s it seemed to really curb the panic attacks however the physical symptoms of anxiety were not much better i believe that the high dose i took was the problem at 400mg daily i believe this med would work very very well for panicagoraphobia even at 800mg daily i was basically fearless but too fearless i did dangerous things like drive drunk take trips in blizzards etc seriously you must be very careful with the dosage with this med it is super powerful but also very very impulsive bottom line if you find the benzos too weak for you or not longacting enough give tegretol a shot before trying the antipsychotics they are too powerful,"agoraphobia, anxiety",1
110,tegretol tegretol was not effective on curing my siezures until the dose was increased twice now i am at 200mg in the morning and 300mg before bed now it helps with the seizures but the sideeffects are awful after twenty hours of sleep i am still exhausted my concentration is shot and i cannot remember anything although the memory may be from the grand mal seizure i am switching my medication as soon as i have another eeg and blood tests after my blood tests my doctor told me that the generic brands of tegretol sometimes have random absorbtion so my levels of tegretol were really really high that could be my problem now i am on tegretol extended release i have only been on it for a week but so far it has been awful my head feels wrong and i am always naseaus,,0
111,carbamazepine i have been using carbamazepine for over twenty years now it is working good for me but i have not got my seizures to stop with it but they have slowed down when i was put on it i was having four to five seizures a day and now i have just four a month,,0
112,it didnt hurt taking it but i sure dont miss it few side effects not literally a hard pill to swallow 20 pound weight gain doc denies it took it for 6 months had one irritable hypomania that lasted 2 months without being on an antidepressant as i am only a pitiful bpii with few manias at any rate i wasnt impressed with it as working per se had to stop taking it due to reaction with new ad nardil feel enlivened awake that could be the start of a new mania have to turn myself in to doc for new mood stabilizer now sigh,"hypomania, mania",1
113,tegretol xr i am a 25 year old female and i have been on tegretol xr since i was 18 it is the only consistent drug that has kept my generalized tonicclonic seizures under control i had right temporal surgery when i was 21 but i had a breakthrough seizure 3 years ago so i am still on teg xr it has kept me under control,"surgery, tonicclonic seizures",1
114,lamictal vs tegretol i am a 107 lb 54 year old female i was on tegretol 75 milligrams very small dosage for a year for complex partial seizures in the left temporal lobe i had very bad side effects and i was very depressed i play tennis and do yoga and was very uncoordinated i would be very sleepy about a half hour after taking the medicine i had to sleep 12 hours a day and still had trouble getting out of bed it also upset my stomach i switched to lamictal and have been on it for a year it is a bit of an upper so i feel great but i have to be careful to take it regularly or i get slightly agitated and depressed the stomach upset is still there but managable with okrapepson after a year my coordination is much better and i can play good tennis again and do yoga balance poses again,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1
115,doing pretty well after finding proper level i am doing pretty well,,0
116,well good i noticed my mind was more clear less racing thoughts mood was generally improved during the 2 weeks of treatment bad made me throw up constantly i had to stop taking it the nauseavomiting lessed win a week of starting but it was still present i was only on 200mgday then and felt it wasnt worth it to continue such a small dose no where near the therapeutic range also caused constant headache ive heard trileptal is very similar w less side effects but im afraid to take it fearing an allergic reaction again,headache,1
117,tegretol i was put on this after depakote stopped working it did well for a while but i needed a higher dose each time we increased the dose i got physically ill sore throath etc it wasnt good for me,,0
118,risks in long term docs believe may be cause of some nerve problems i also had a terrible experience with my level changing without me having changed how much i took may not have been tegretols fault but caused me to be very very sick with multiple overdose symptoms who would have guessed it was even possible to have overdose symptoms if you didnt take an overdose not i,overdose,1
119,tegretol tiredness tegretol makes me tired stiff and sore all over i am 62 so feeling ten years older than i really am is not good regardless the mood stabilization is worth it i like staying employed married and generally liked i was surprised that tegretol is now touted to prevent migraines when it had never been my experience as far back as 1984 that mood stabilizers relieve headaches more than causing them sure enough a few months on carbamazepine and i was getting migraines from it i tried cutting the pills into quarters 50mg and still got migraines i tried bits of the pill along with bits of depakote to avoid the migraine each gives and hoping the two together would benefit me particularly in conjunction with the very small amounts i take of zyprexa and thorazine i still got migraines nevertheless i am currently using the related oxcarbazepine which does have less side effects but trileptal seems to be starting to give me migraines too,migraine,1
120,tegretol superceded by trileptal carbamazepine only prevented migraines somewhat until it turned on me and causes migraines even in the smallest division of a pill yet i am now trying its cousin oxcarbazepine which seems to live up to its reputation for fewer side effects trileptal does not make me feel as stiff sore and old as tegretol and if i split my 150 mg pill in half it prevents migraines more than causing them surprisingly i do better with it earlier in the day rather than at bedtime i need to be able to take pain relievers while i am awake if it starts a headache,"headache, pain",1
121,worked wonders when i was first diagnosed with complex partial seizures 20 years ago i am 46 now my neurologist put me on tegretol almost immediately the seizures stopped i felt somewhat sleepy on the medication but functional enough to go to work otherwise because it completely resolved my seizures while i was on it i was feeling normal for the first time in years unfortunately after about two or three weeks on the medication i broke out in a rash all over and had to switch to mysoline which was much more sedating i thought it was a great drug to control my seizures and was disappointed i had to give it up when i developed the drug rash,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures, rash",1
122,tegretol works i have had seizures since i was a very young child they actually think that i had them at birth but no one noticed them until they became harder at the age of 6 i was put on one med after another until they finally stabilized me on phenobarbital and dilantin but i still had a few spells and all the doctors would do is add another dilantin one day as an adult i had to go to the emergency room to have multiple seizures stopped and when the doctor saw i was taking 12 dilantin a day he ordered me to stop taking them right away that is when i got put on tegretol my miracle drug i was no longer drowsy or had to push 12 pills a day i only took 5 200 mg a day but through the years they did the same thing with it as they did with the dilantin i was on 8 a day when i got my vns implant good news i am only on 4 a day now i seem to only have seizures at night now or when i sleep at least 2 hrs in a row the tegretol has no side effects and i am able to lead a very full and active live even though i am 52 now i also take 1 200 mg topamax at night but nothing seems to affect the seizures i have at 12 midnight and at 3 am,,0
123,side effects i have been taking 900 mg a day for several months now and overall have noticed a great change in my mood stablility i had previously been on depakote and noticed a great change in my weight which did not help with my overall self esteem i am also taking welbutrin and effexor for treatment resistance depression for over 4 years and the tegretol has been the needed addition however i have been having a noticeable lack of energy and feel i could sleep most of the time to that end i have attempted adjusting the times in which i take my meds and still no avail i have just been placed on adderal 10mg a day i hate being on so many meds but i finally feel the best i have in so long that i am scared to adjust the dosage hopefully the added energy with the adderal will make all the difference will keep you posted,depression,1
124,was a good med for me i was on tegretol and xr for 15 years for partial complexsimplex seizures it worked great for me for the most part and no sideeffects at therapeutic levels got toxic twice the only problem that i really had with it is that it interacts with so many other medications the only reason that i switched is because i have severe migraines and my docs wanted to use other anticonvulsants to manage that so we switched highest dose was 1200mg but only tolerated 1000mg,,0
125,ok but have to watch my liver enzymes ok however i would like to try topamaxanyway after gaining a lot of weight from depakote i conducted my own research and discovered that tegretol was the moodstabilizer wthe least weightrelated side effects note this was before topa was recognized for bp i do have sedation but find this helpful most of the time i do have preexisting liver disease and need to keep a check on my lft levels,sedation,1

127,fewer migraines when i stopped taking it was taking this med for a few yrs at different doses for mood stabilizer during that time i got migraine headaches did not realize the tegretol was making it worse once i stopped taking the med with dr supervision my migraines became much less frequent,migraine,1
128,tegretol and sunno my husband had terrible side effects with depakote we thought he had parkinsons until he got off the depakote has been on tegretol for 25 months we really decreased the dosage from the initial rx and that has helped the rash he takes neurontin too and we have tried to use that as monotherapy as it has fewer side fx but had a slight sz last night first in 8 months so guess we cant drop the tegretol by and large we are really gunshy of meds after the depakote debacle so are probably under rather than over medicating,rash,1
129,bipolar freak i was about 21 when i first changed from dilantin to tegretol i am now 42 and clearly remember what dilantins effects were i switched to dilantins evil sister tegretol which made me a hated mood freak switch hitter lamictal came along and saved me oh by the way tegretol didnt do much to control my seizures either just helped with the auras lamictal rocks,,0
130,tegretol and my blood i love this drug but it has given me some weird blood disorder i have rapid cycling bipolar and am working myself out of the other drugs due to them not working with my body i have low red and white blood counts which is really as i understand it sort of unusual for the drug so far i have been allergic to the other drugs depakote and neurontin that they tried on me tegretol worked great for me for quite a while now i am pretty sicklethargic have some mood swings mainly depression they want to put me on lithium this week but i am not so sure,"blood disorder, depression, mood swings",1
131,time to move on after twenty years on tegretol i can say that it worked very well for me minor side effects included a few years of persistent exfoliating dermatitis on my hands and fingers and occasional sleepiness the only major side effect i am aware of is male breast enlargement and it has become noticeable enough that yesterday i asked my doctor to prescribe another aed,"breast enlargement, dermatitis",1
132,tegretol xr ive been on tegretol xr for about 10 yrs now its been a very good seizure control medication for me ive had szs since i was 16 im 43 now i like the fact that its long lastingit means less pills to take thoughout the day for me,,0
133,tegretol troubles i have tried tegretol alone and once with lithium it really didnt do anything for me unfortunately it can affect your white blood count and enhance the activity of liver enzymes this means that sometimes you have to up the dosages of your other meds because the liver metabolizes them so quickly you do need to be very careful if you are taking the pill and use alternative forms of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy trileptal is tegretols little sister it is not quite as strong an agent as tegretol but the side effects are much diminished,pregnancy,1
134,tegretol xr 500 mg twice daily i take 1000 mgs twice a day to control generalized tonicclonic seizures that i have had since i was seventeen 47 now it is by far the best aed i have tried in 30 years due in large part to the fact that it does not cause psychotic episodes like the combo of dilantin and phenobarb did,tonicclonic seizures,1
135,tegretol epilepsy i used to take tegretol dilantin together when i was first diagnosed with epilepsy at age 4 now 45 this seemed to work well until i was in my teens i was not aware of sideeffects at that time my world was always different to others in 1998 i was put back on it and found it really made my head feel quite strange unlike anything i had ever experienced i would never go back to tegretol as it scared me to feel so not myself,epilepsy,1
136,carbatrol for 56 year old it just didnt workperiod what was most frustrating was the period of time it took the neuro to realize that it didnt work this med can sometimes have serious side effects so make sure you have labs run regularly,,0
137,not so great carbamazepine was the first drug our son was placed on when his seizures began it worked for 11 days and then the seizures came back longer and more frequently after a disasterous three days of valproic acid along with the carb he was placed on topamax and carbamazepine the carb lowered the topamax level in his bloodstream and he was finally weaned off of it 3 months later and he has been on topamax for a year now with a small dose of tranxene,,0
138,carbtrol user ive been using tegretol for about 6 years and for 5 of those years ive been taking carbatrol carbatrol seems to have fewer side effects probably because of the medicines release mechanism each caplet releases medication over 3 time periods over 12 hours this mechanism is different to tegretol xr which releases the medication steadily over time the majority of sideeffects from the drug tend to ease after only a few days and is probably the only major epilepsy medication with this property depakote dilantin and phenobarb each have a large variety of side effects that never seem to go away during treatment however i still have some transient periods of shortterm memory lapses and missing words that i cant explain completely ive been taking carbatrol with lamictal enabling me to take a reduced dose the smaller dose further reduced my side effects,epilepsy,1
139,over all effective medication has been used for thirteen years also been very effective taken off for short amount of time before pregnancy in late 1992 then put back on because of seizure about a year to a year 12 later,pregnancy,1
140,major effect confusion i was placed on tegretol to help balance my moods and to supplement my combination of nardil and surmontil i found that i was constantly confused and i had an inkling it was because of the tegretol so i did stop taking it without consulting my psychiatrist i felt the confusion lift somewhat but on surmontil and nardil my moods began to cycle between highs and lows i have resistant depression and not bipolar my psychiatrist tried to persuade me back on to tegretol but i wasnt having it,depression,1
141,worked but couldnt tolerate tegretol like dilantin worked to control my seizures after just a couple weeks on it but also like dilantin it made me break out from head to toe in a rash made me unable to stay awake and gave me high fevers that we constantly had to combat with tylenol,rash,1
142,carbatrol he had to start this after using wellbutrin and having seizures i dont know if this is part of the whole autism thing or if it was brought on by the wellbutrin because he was more susceptible but i do know that his other meds play off of this one so it is all part of the picture,autism,1
143,tegretol successful in controlling sons seizures tegretol was the first drug that was tried for my sons seizures absence and partial complex w 2ndary gen and fortunately it worked for those febrile seizures still break through while on it but we have diastat for those although it has been around for a long time and because it must be tegretol it costs 40 a month for a prescription with our insurance plan harvard pilgrim initially when starting and any time increasing dosage he is more sleepy and his balance is slightly off otherwise no other side effects to date since hes a toddler and sometimes wont take it we often crush it and mix it with applesauce lest he feed it to the dog again ps the way to make a dog vomit anything tegretol included is to feed it a spoonful of hydrogen peroxide as learned from the 1800 poison for dogs,,0
144,initially ok it worked at first however i noticed apnea symptoms after my son was put on the full dose docs said no not the drug but it was and after a few months he was sick all the time constant sinus and colds until he started breaking through ended up he did have a questionable white cell count which is one of the side effects you need to know about,,0
145,mood stabilizer ive been taking this stuff for a long time over 10 years i understand it can be helpful for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder ie manicdepressive but im not bioplar i suffer from ocd and depression one of the reasons i think he prescribed it was because i have a tendency to become hypomanic from some antidepressants my doctor also says it is a great mood stabilizer and helps the antidepressants work more effectively i trust this guy so i decided to take his advice i know in the beginning this medication made me incredibly tired i also had to get blood tests done every few weeks to make sure i didnt develop a fatal blood reaction a very rare sideeffect but my doctor is cautious that was a real annoyance over the course of that first year he changed my blood tests to every three months than every 6 months now i get one once a year after a few months your body gets used to the medication and you are not tired all the time my only concern are the potential long term effects ive read reports that this can contribute to osteoporosis which i am slowly developing and i always wonder how i would do if i didnt take it anymore while no doctor can make you take medication my psychiatrist really does not want me to discontinue this over the years he has reluctantly let me stop my antidepressants but he is adamant about me staying on the tegretol he claims it helps my mood and that hes seen an improvement since ive been taking it i guess ill have to take his word because i feel no different in the way i think or feel from this stuff in the past few months i have recently switched to carbatrol i feel no different,"bipolar disorder, depression, osteoporosis",1

147,stop roll over play dead thats what it says to my hypomanic episodes i cant believe how much a difference this drug has made it could also be the fact that i finally have received a proper disagnosis of bpii after all these years my only problem is having to take the pills twice a day but really thats not a heartache now i just have to work on the depressive side of the coin and ill be all set,,0

149,the best for long term hands down i have had bp1 all my life after being on every med on the market and some experimental ones tegretol has given me at least some sort of normality to life yes i break through sometimes but in 13 years it has helped me deal with some real issues and the side effects are minimal yes you have to have a blood test every 3 6 months but everything considered it has been the best long term stabilizer that i have taken and i expect to be on it the rest of my life there have been pretenders to the throne come and go but for me tegretol is still the king,,0
150,tegretol ive tried many other seizure drugs this one has worked best,,0
151,works but watch the labs and drug interactions this was such a welcome relief for me because i had been on depakote for 4 years and had gained 60 pounds i lost all of that within 3 months of starting tegretol i was initially very lethargic and tired so we kept the dose down to around 300400 mg and when i would get used to the dose we would go up 100 mg the maximum tolerable dose for me is around 600 mg we tried once to go up to 800 mg but i was a zombie for me this has been the best drug for depression and hypomania without having to add another mood stabilizer once in a great while we add some celexa for occasional breakthrough depression but i come off it as soon as the depression lifts i found a couple of years ago that for me it is not best to keep a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant going simultaneously as i dip up and down terribly i am a rapid cycler you must watch the blood work on this one and be sure to tell any health care provider treating you that you are on this how much etc there are some serious drug interactions if one is not careful my alt liver enzyme stays slightly elevated but not dangerously so in the opinion of my primary doctor and psychiatrist i do take xanax for panic attacks on a regular basis i find tegretol a little sedating but i think i am so accustomed to taking the drug that i seldom notice that anymore i would like to try trileptal because of the lack of required labs etc but i am reluctant because some have had less than desirable results i would not want to mess up what i have now but i still dont feel this is as good as it gets however in retrospect it may be for the time being with the advances in medicine where they stand the best remedy may be yet to come best wishes,"depression, hypomania",1
152,control of seizures i have been taking tegretol since may last year since then i have gone from having one tonic clonic seizure a month to none i find in invaluable i always took a long time to recover from seizures frequently suffered with concusion after hitting my head from falling and nearly always needed hospital treatment the only sideeffects ive noticed are feeling tired i know it doesnt work for everyone it had no effect on my son who also suffers from epilepsy but for me it has been 100 effective,epilepsy,1
153,tegretol for bi polar i was on lithium for a few years and it had broken me out all over and i had gained 50 pounds my psychiatrist switched me to tegretol instead and it has been great it also has served a dual medical purpose for me i am taking 80 mg a day of lipitor for an extremely high lipid profile this high dose would give me severe leg cramps in the evenings well the tegretol took care of that problem too i am also on 40 mg a day of prozac doing great,,0
154,tegretol cr been on this for 11 years helped with control reduced intensity of seizures but not frequency have tried as standalone but doesnt give full control hence almost always used it in combination with other drugs,,0

156,am i stoned or what i would have to say that the stuff makes you feel stoned it felt like the good old days except i was by myself laughing at work at home or anywhere for that matter i can say it did help with the anxiety i get around people but seriously i dont remember what even happened this last week i slept mostly when i wasnt already in a daze it felt nice to be getting some good rest but not when i woke up feeling restless after a 14 hour nap i knocked out right after work i would not recommend driving while on this med its like driving drunk i speak from experience im surprised i made it home last tuesday from work i highly recommend carpooling and normally i am a shy person but tegretol really did it for me for the social scene but while i say dumb things from time to time and i worry much less on the stuff i realized that i wasnt really living my life one day i would have to face my fears and worries old school style i cant say that im really addicted to the stuff because ive been taking it only for a week im really contradicting myself here but taking the stuff does sound like a vacation for me when i dont want to think of the serious issues but if you dont mind the occasional speech slur or the occasional i cant believe heshe said that stare i say what the heck go for it it might even be your remedy too,"anxiety, worry",1
157,worked great but keep up your blood work i loved tegretol i really did 300 mg a day and i was almost completely stable unfortunatly im one of the 6 in a million who developed agranulocytosis so i had to stop the only other side effect i had was a mild headache which is common agranulocytosis isnt,"agranulocytosis, headache",1

164,symptom patching carbamazepine treats moodiness or seizures basically takes away the ability to understand anything but logic to some degree so if you want to treat the flu with antihistamines go for it adders arent moody theyre mentally or physically hyperactive or unable to hone in on one signal its a disability not an attitude the attitude is due to disgruntledness it will go away with proper treatment get exercise find something to help focus and give up the mental battle,disability,1

173,tegretol rod tegretol has been a great thing for me been taking it since 1991 with frisium as an adjunctive i havent had a hint of a seizure whereas dilantin made me worse side effects weight gain would have to be the main one though my age of 53 might also contribute to that i quit smoking 5 years ago and im told that can cause weight gain in a lot of people another side effect is occasional impotence other than that nothing i can think of basically tegretol is a very safe effective and easy to use medication,,0

182,tegratol ive been taking this drug for 4 years now every year or two i have an upward adjustment in the dosage of medication i have this past week been increased from 1000mgday to 1200mgday the major side effect that i see is that i become very slugish my desire to play sports or maintain an active live style is decreased for about 4 to 8 weeks until i adjust as a result weight gain is not uncommon i personally find that when i have a large amount of stress at work for an extended period of time couple weeks the drugs effectiveness is decreased the seisuze usually occurs once i start to relax after a stressful period the doctors have now added frisium to my list of drugs does anyone have any experiences they would be willing to share about this drug what should i expect thanks,"stress, stress at work",1

358,prescribed for my epilepsy and was consuming this along with keppra for 3 years i recommend carbamaz to be taken for people with mood problems instead of epilepsy because it doesnt really help prevent your seizures however it helps maintain your mood my seizures never stopped and the medication was useless for them didnt even help with anxiety sadly dependency rate starts increasing after 8 months of daily usage more dosage is needed every 6 months and its withdrawals where so hard on me never had a problem with bipolar or anything like that however carbas withdrawals really messed up my sleeping pattern and mood depression and anger eventually my epilepsy got worst due to carbas withdrawals effect wouldnt recommend this drug for kids or teenagers,"anger, anxiety, depression, epilepsy",1

364,i was prescribed this drug to alleviate the pain of trigeminal neuralgia what a terrible experience only 4 days into it and i became overly down on the world and virtually everything in it i was so saddened by everything around me i was unable to simply look at photos of my children that i had easily done in the many years prior to this week without any sort of difficulty whatsoever not really sure why it affected me in this manner so i went back to the dr he said that this medication is sometimes prescribed to help other people deal and cope with bipolar disorder mania and he mentioned a couple of other things too i hope that this medication is more helpful to others that may try it for this purpose or the others too,"bipolar disorder, mania, neuralgia, pain, trigeminal neuralgia",1

368,tegretol xr works well in controlling partial onset seizures just as long as you take it vigilantly and sleep regularly there are two things that keep this medication from being a ten the first is the fact that your body becomes resistant to the effects of the medication resulting in a neverending dosage increase to maintain your results the other is one of the side effects of this medication is unsteady hands and that can make certain tasks somewhat difficult but as long you follow simple guidelines this medication in conjunction with another anticonvulsant does quite well at keeping your disorder in check,,0
369,for effectiveness in my case this medicine gets a 1 for keeping me manic the entire time it was prescribed it gets a 10 my bipolar mania even seemed to be triggered and brought on originally from this a huge and long episode ensued about 2 weeks into its initial use for the most part the mania was of the more pleasant and euphoric type rather than the agitated and awful one it did do one thing it made me absolutely certain that i had bipolar disorder without a single doubt it worked effectively on my late mother but just kept me artificially happy like any psych med its hit or miss and essentially i struck out,"bipolar disorder, mania",1

505,i have used carbamazepine er for 30 years and it has worked well except for 2 seizures 14 years ago which i attribute to the change i had to increase my doseage to a total of 1100mgday split between morning and evening i have had some memory loss but that started just after my first seizure when i was 35 and was told it was brain disintegration cant think of the right word finding words is sometimes difficult but cant know if it is the medication or the state of my brain after the seizure every 3 weeks or so i have an aura where i cant follow conversation or process information well it ends with a headache so i know it is going away if often lasts all day and i may wake up with it i dont know if that means less control by the medicine or not at least i have not had any seizures for 14 years the only really bad thing is that this drug is part of a class of aeds that cause bone loss after all of these years i have severe osteoporosis and broke my arm after a bad fall the surgeon had to pin everything together and said my bones were weaker than he had anticipated considering i may have at least another 20 years to go i am considering changing to another drug that does not affect bones however all of the reviews i have read on those lamotrigine vimpat topirimate and leviracetam are very scary taking fosamax for my bones is not the answer apparently since i had been doing that for a number of years anyone with any info on this is very appreciated i suggest all long term users to have bone density tests every 2 years even the men ,"aura, fall, headache, memory loss, osteoporosis",1
