0,i saw someone said in review that this medication does not treat hormonal migraines it actually does i get my migraine for about 3 days every single month like clockwork either before or during period before finding this medicine i ended up in the urgent care one time because i had thrown up enough from migraine i was getting dehydrated started taking this by nasal spray and it gives me relief in about 510 minutes it lasts about 56 hrs and then often comes back if in that 3day time period no more throwing up no more laying in bed for those 3 days i always worry about longterm effects of drugs but its affected my qualify of life so much that i always make sure i have it on hand now for that one week a month its been a total blessing,"migraine, worry",1
1,for anyone with migraines that have taken countless medications in pill form like i have talk to your doctor about gastric stasis this is when your stomach essentially shuts down when you get a migraine and it cant absorb anything my consultant finally explained this to me and i was prescribed sumatriptan in injection form after 20 years of taking tablets and them being totally ineffective the very next migraine i use the injection and within 10 minutes i can feel it subsidising i do have to sleep it off but this is a miracle for me and is the first thing that has remotely done anything to help fantastic,migraine,1
2,i have been taking for 20 years now for migraines i inject into my belly more fat less pain and i never hit a vein that squirts blood after removal of needle giving myself an injection no longer an issue at all relief usually within 60 or so minutes ladies it does not work on my menstrual hormonal migraines,pain,1
3,imitrex injections saved my life i am a lifelong migraine headache sufferer ive been to many doctors and tried many different prescriptions from suppositories to dainty little pills without help when imitrex injections found its way to my life i knew i found a remedy for life i would give myself a shot on the fleshy part of my hip wait about a minute or two and then i would experience the steel gates in my head unlock then i would fall asleep for about an hour when i awoke the headache was completely gone i had energy i was thinking clearly and i pulled myself together marveling about how much better i felt my experience was always the same each time i used the injection i experienced 100 relief i will confess the giving myself an injection was something i had to overcome usually i had my husband nearby to look in on me to make sure i was okay but after many times i started feeling more confident i call imitrex a miracle drug dont give up on it,"fall, headache, migraine",1

6,i suffer from cluster headaches for about a month every 12yrs before the dr prescribed me this i was on pain pills and did nothing for me at all this med i take it as soon as i feel one coming on and within 2030 min its completely gone this med has helped me alot,pain,1
7,every time i take my imitrex i get a pain in my chest my skin feels tingly and numb and my jaw locks and my neck is stiff so yeah my pain from my migraine is down but i become extremely uncomfortable and cant sleep or feel comfy while recovering from the migraine pain,"migraine, pain",1

10,i just spent the day trying to figure out the cause of sudden chest pain in the middle of the night not bad enough to call 911 but very quick sudden and strong but went mostly away quickly too but when i woke up i felt like someone had a boot on my chest and was digging their heel into my chest the doctor did an ekg cat scan and ultrasound on me nothing was found the only thing she found was elevated d diners which can sometimes indicate blood clots but none where found i did tell her i took an imitrex the night before but she didnt seem to even investigate that as a possible factor now i read on here that many people have chest pain tightness as a side effect making them feel like they are having a heart attack it was my 3rd time taking imitrex the first 2 times were fine i wont take it again,"chest pain, pain",1
11,i take 50 mg sumatriptan for migraines most of the time my migraines are not head pain at all but rather vertigo they is extremely sensitive to light sounds and head movements it can be so bad i vomit after years of trying everything from blood pressure medication i dont have blood pressure issues antidepressants i dont suffer from depression and motion sickness medication we finally found out that daily magnesium occasionally sudafed if i have had a recent cold and sumatriptan on the onset of a migraine does the trick im very reactive to most medication and typically take half the dosage but take the full 50 mg of sumatriptan when i take it within 35 minutes i feel a warm feeling up the back of my neck and down my arms through my fingers i feel almost like ive been drinking alcohol but a little more anxious within the hour that goes away and i can function again this is something i have never been able to do on any other medication i usually have to take a nap to make my migraines go away but having sumatriptan is a life saver,"depression, migraine, motion sickness, pain, sickness, vertigo",1
12,only for a true true migraine the benefits out weigh the side effects before imitrex i am on generic version of imitrex i would end up at er frequently thank god for this migraine treatment i must reiterate however this only works for true migraine headaches,migraine,1
13,i have taken this 4 times now and each time i feel as if i can not breathe and am choking the pressure it causes in my shoulders causes a headache as well im not taking this anymore honestly i would rather take excedrin ibuprofen or deal with the migraine than feel like im suffocating,"choking, headache, migraine",1
14,this drug is for migraines period so if it isnt working on your headaches quite possibly you dont actually have migraines but rather cluster or tension headaches which it does not get rid of as for side effects all medications have the possibility to cause side effects just because it causes them on someone doesnt mean it will on you if you are worried about it go to an er waiting room to take your first dose i have been on imitrex for over 10 years and it has only failed to get rid of my headache twice those two times i assume were not migraines best migraine medication on the market for true migraines,"headache, migraine, tension",1
15,ive had chronic cluster headaches for nearly 20 years i was episodic for 12 years before that imitrex and its generic sumatriptan has saved my life without a doubt it stops my cluster attacks within 1520 minutes everytime no other drug has even come close to the relief i get from imitrex no amount of narcotics not even iv narcotics help me like imitrex dose i use it multiple times a day as soon as an attack begins i would be dead today without imitrex i seriously doubt anyone anywhere has used more imitrex than i have also ive never experienced any serious side effects from using it although i do believe it can cause rebound headaches when used too often i am mr clusters,,0
16,i started to get migraines a few years back and after trying preventative care for migraines dr put me on sumatriptan 100 let me just tell you that depending on the severity of my migraines sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt however when i have med migraines this medicine works wonders on me i dont know why but with in 1 hour of taking this medication i feel amazing i am pain free for 12 hours takes effect for 12 hours so in a 24 hour period i take 2 100mg tablets i do sometimes very rarely feel tightness in my chest after taking it and sometimes when my migraines are too strong i feel drugged out after taking it and really really sleepy and when its one of those terrible migraines i take the pill but have to add 2 alkazeltzer to feel a bit better but feel zoned out for hours anyways i love this medication for making me feel back to myself again,pain,1
17,imitrex and its generic has been a lifesaver for me i have used it over 20 years now and highly recommend it to others i have developed autoimmune disorders and when i have a migraine during a flare the shot will at least knock the burning edge off so i can deal i hope you all find something that works for you and eases your pain,"migraine, pain",1
18,prescribed for migraines landed me in the er with heart attack symptoms hallucinating so bad that the ground was like waves i couldnt see to walk into er neck and chest on fire did not help migraine at all i was getting awful vertigo and throbbing migraines put sumatriptan on top of it and thought i was not going to survive it had similar reaction to busbar years ago,"migraine, vertigo",1

21,i finally managed to talk to a doctor about my migraines didnt have health insurance before it works great for me it makes the pain go away almost completely yes there are side effects for me those are slight dizziness brain fog and sleepiness also heavy feeling in my hands and throat tightness so there are unpleasant side effects but they sure as hell beat level 10 pain that used to leave me bedridden and in tears for entire day,"bedridden, dizziness, pain, throat tightness",1
22,i am prescribed the generic version of imitrex i was originally prescribed the 25 mg where i had to take another dose two hours later migraine persisted spoke to my doctor who upped my dossage to 50 mg and i only need to take one today is a especially bad day where i woke up extremely dizzy where you walk into walls and doorways because you cant walk straight as well as had the usual aura the previous day and stars instead of a migraine running out of the gate as i woke up it transitioned slowly today i took my imitrex and started to feel the migraine dissapate however usually comes with feelings of being warm in my armslegs as well as feeling weak to me it feels similar when you are starting to get a buzz from alcohol makes me slightly uncomfortable but is much better than dealing with unbearable migraine pain,"aura, migraine, pain",1

24,ive had migraines for years since i was 7 years old ive been on every medication that can be described for this unbearable pain and sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me headaches and migraines are different because migraines make it unbearable to live a normal life before sumatriptan i couldnt keep a job or a relationship because its hard to explain an excruciating pain thats not visible taking sumitriptan gave me my life back and i can feel confident leaving my house everyday knowing i have a reliable medication to help me when i get a migraine like every other medicine out there sumitriptan has its side effects but its nothing compared the weekly pain i had to suffer for the last 23 years if youre sick of taking multiple medications everyday to prevent migraines and want something thatll relieve it right away take sumitriptan,"migraine, pain",1

27,ive taken these injections on and off over the last 10yrs but the first time i took it i was totally amazed how fast it started to work 1015 secs and the headache was gone in 510 mins i tried oxygen for a while but it just seemed to push the headache off for a few hours i tried the nasal spray once it worked just fine not as quick as the injectors no shocker but it did shut the headache down fairly quickly my biggest problem is getting enough injections to finish the cluster attack im on tricare my last cluster knock wood has been about 5yrs ago i went thru about 130 injections i had to get the patient advocacy officer involved so a little more hassle but i got the injectors i needed,headache,1
28,i have been on imitrex for over a year nowits like a miracle curepeople know the word migraine but really dont know what it would feel likeuntil you have oneit hurtsits painfuland if i didnt have the sumatriptan imitrex to fall back on i dont know what i would dofor the most part it could take 2 hours for the migraine to fully be gonebut the pain starts to subside pretty quicklyfortunately i never had a bad reactionbut i still am trying to see how often is safe to use thisi have looked up some of the triggersand one is the weather and air pressurethe weather outside now is extremely hot and humid with air quality not so goodso maybe thats my triggerbut sometimes i feel like i can take this 23x a weekand im not sure this is too muchthey only dispense a pack of 9 tablets a monthso that also makes me feel you have to be cautiousother than thatthese pills are a miracle pillit helps me every time,"fall, migraine, pain",1
29,i started getting migraine headaches about 2 years ago and it took a while for them to finally prescribe me imitrex i would lay in bed with all the lights out crying because of how horrible the pain and nausea were i couldnt go to school because i couldnt focus and would throw up in class thanks to imitrex i finally have my life back again migraines that used to last 23 days at a time are now completely gone after a 50100mg dose im so thankful for this drug and even though i do get side effectstightness in chest i would much rather have that then the migraine pain,"crying, migraine, nausea, pain",1
30,seems to be this drug either works or it doesnt anyways i never like reading drug reviews before taking them because they can cause unnecessary anxiety priming effect this drug doesnt work for me i had a moderate headache and tried it within 30 minutes my head was in a lot of pain a pain i had never felt before like every single blood vessel was closing my mood became worse tightening of the throat chest and it hurt to even talk nausea was a big issue it also made me drowsy i called my friend and joked if i die call the police i ended up falling asleep for 4 hrs and feel much better now well yeah it also increases seratonin so i wouldnt recommend taking it if you already are taking some ssrisnri worth a shot but dont try it for the first time if you have something important coming up,"anxiety, headache, nausea, pain",1
31,when i took the pill it gave me a uncomfort in my jaw felt like i had being chewing for hours it didnt take my migraine away instead it make it worse turned the sharp pain into a dull and nagging pain doctor tried rising and lowering the dose nothing helped,"migraine, pain",1

33,doc prescribed me this for migraines after getting on google and seeing some of the reviews i became nervous to actually take it well i did out of desperation with my phone by my side and told my partner of my concerns usually i am at the mercy of time i waited long enough on tylenol and advil that i was resulting to the binaural beats herbal teas cold rag self massage in a dark quiet room then my curiosity caved and right now i can look at this screen and type up a review of this miracle i did get sleepy as in instead of laying in misery i thought i could actually fall asleep if i get up to fast i do get dizzy but i can get up with the lights on the throbbing in the temples is so much less that i dont even notice it reviews are not something i normally do but this the exception i wish i would have found this sooner,fall,1
34,this literally made me feel like i was dying tightness in my chest and throat couldnt stand for more than 10 minutes without feeling like i was going to pass out i wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy ive had migraines for thr last 14 years and id still rather deal woth the pain rather than feel like i had a ton of bricks on my chest this also worsened my anxiety 10x,"anxiety, pain",1
35,i get migraines from time to time and the only way to get rid of them is an entire 8 hours of sleep i was given sumatriptan 100mg oral tablets and after one pill and 15 minutes my migraine is gone i do have to admit i feel some side effects every muscle in my body hurts the day after and i honestly feel like im high for about 2 hours after taking it slightly lightheaded and not all the way there i would take the side effects over a migraine still,migraine,1
36,i have gotten migraines regularly since age 12 imitrex came onto the market when i was 16 and i was amazed that something actually workedstopped the nausea light and sound sensitivity head pain everything i keep 100 mg on hand now because i still get frequent migraines side effects i experience are chest tightness skin sensitivity brain fog and facial flushing uncomfortable but preferable to a migraine from my understanding it either works for you or you hate it nothing else has ever worked for me,"chest tightness, flushing, migraine, nausea, pain",1
37,scary 10 minutes after i took this medication i started slurring my words shortly after i had arm pain on my left atm and unbearable chest and throat pressure almost like i was wearing a corset on my chest and neck my vision went blurry and i heard a bbuzz i couldnt breathe i felt like i wasnt getting enough air to this day 6 months later i am still having attacks and issues i go for a echo tomorrow to see if i have a heart condition one pill one time almost killed me i suffer every single day from taking it and i have developed extreme pstd if you have any other options dont risk it long term use is also linked to cardiac issues they need to take this drug off the market its really dangerous please head my warning im only 24 and i suffer daily,pain,1

39,i took this for tension headaches and it is the first medication i have ever had a reaction to while my reaction was far less alarming than others i have read about it was too severe to pass off as simple side effects upon taking one oral dose my ankles swelled up like balloons to make matters worse it also made me feel extremely off mentally made me very dizzy and gave me a racing heart i had to call someone to come get me from work because i was so close to passing out i couldnt drive myself home im not saying it isnt worth a try if you suffer a miserable life of headaches it may end up being your miracle instead of my nightmare but monitor yourself closely for reactions as it seems to be somewhat common that certain people cant tolerate the medication after many trials and errors i have been put on firoicet which is brilliant and my miracle drug for my tension headaches,"nightmare, tension",1
40,ive suffered from migraines for several years imitrex literally gave me my life back yes i do have some side effects now and then but the benefits out way the risks,,0

50,i took the recommended dosage and felt no relief i was told to take another if it didnt change within 2 hours i took another and my migraine was still as intense as when it began i took a coctail of ibuprofen acetaminophen and caffeine recommended by a doctor and it relieved my pain from the shoulders and base of my skull within 30 minutes not helpful,"migraine, pain",1
51,imitrex changed my life i have had migrains from the time i was 3 years old initially as a child a migrain would send me to bed for an afternoon then as a teenager i would be down for 12 to 24 hours as an adult i would be in bed for 24 to 72 hours with no relief now i take my imitrex at the first sign of a migrain aura visual disturbance funny feeling i take a tablet and within 1015 min i am fine the crashing pain never comes and instead of losing a whole day or more in bed i am on the go again within 30 minutes and sometime dont even have to slow down at all imitrex is definately a life changer for me,"aura, pain, visual disturbance",1
52,literally the worst very unhelpful i was started on 100mg and it was horrible so i tried cutting the pills in half down to 50mg doctor said it was okay but the side effects were just as bad i would take imitrex as soon as i knew id be getting a migraine about 30 45 minutes before the migraine and i would still get a migraine and a strong slightly painful mostly uncomfortable burning feeling in my nose i took the pill form and not nasal spray so that was confusing along with chills shakiness strong nausea sleepiness and overall felt very sick and weak i would not recommend however i know imitrex works well for my grandpa so i do know it works for some peoplejust be careful,"chills, migraine, nausea, shakiness",1
53,i am 53 years old male living in los angeles i have had headaches since i was 20 years old i had several medical tests to rule out brain tumor and other issues ibuprofen works most of the time but there are times my headache is so bad that i leave my job or if i am home i stay in my kitchen all night keeping ice on my head recently my doctor prescribed imitrex just one pill that is all i need it gets rid of my headache for 36 hours there are very minor side effects but i dont care recently i spoke with my doctor again and he told me this medication is safe as long as i dont take everyday,headache,1
54,i take the generic sumatriptan ive been taking it for about 2 years the first year i would get a small hives rash on my side and it took about a year for it to disappear but it was a small price to pay for the relief now i get no reactions at all and only relief it works wonderfully and i have my life back i love sumatriptan my medicare gives me a months supply for only 20 copay my headaches are chronic i have cluster headaches they never go away so this medicine is a godsend one 100mg pill provides relief for about 24 hours sometimes a little less one time instead of taking it when i woke up in the morning i had to take another dose at 3am in the morning the headache came back a little sooner than usually but most of the time one pill 100mg will last me 24 hours before sumatriptan imitrex i was on the verse of suicide taking tons of exedrin which didnt work that well and it was making me feel horrible and very hard on the liver i couldnt say enough about this medicine one thing for some reason i take headache powder goodys with it and it seems to work better with the powder than just one pill by itself or it maybe im ju,"headache, rash, suicide",1

56,i was given imitrex by injection for my migraine and i got no relief at all this was the first time ive had in and needless to say i will not be running to imitrex next time i have have a migraine,migraine,1
57,i went for years with severe migraines aura nausea and all before being introduced to imitrex i tried all of the other migraine medicine from zomig topomax amerge not even mentioning overthecounter and nothing worked imitrex is the only medicine that would ever relieve my headaches i have not read all the reviews here yet maybe i am repeating what others have said but thats ok proof that it works and its side effects about 15 years ago i found that taking ibuprofen aleve or any other pain reliever with the imitrex will cancel some of the side effects ive been having from the imitrex muscle pain tightness in my neck as well as overemphasis of anything wrong with me at the time if i had a sunburn the imitrex will make me feel like i was on live fire if my teeth were sensitive the imitrex made them 10x more sensitive you get the idea then they came out with treximet imitrexaleve much more expensive than imitrex alone made me wish i pitched the idea to gsk and make some money off of it obviously others also found that taking pain relievers with it will diminish some of the side effects i started taking the lower doses it wasnt as effective,"aura, migraine, nausea, pain, sunburn",1
58,i have suffered from migraines for years i tried midrin maxalt and for about 5 years was on nortriptyline as a preventive in more recent years i was on topamax as a daily preventative but didnt like the side effects i now just take 100 mg of the generic imitrex whenever i have a migraine it works wonderfully i do have some minor side effects but they are tolerable mainly mild discomfort in my jaw also if i eat anything hot or cold it magnifies the sensation same with eating something sweet or tart also if i take a shower within a couple hours of taking it the shower feels twice as hot as it really is odd but i think it is because of how it effects the blood vessels all in all it works and i rarely have to take a second dose it does seem to take about an hour to work fully but i am fine with that as long as it works and it does highly recommend,"discomfort, migraine",1
59,im a poster child for the effectiveness of imitrex nothingbut nothingworked for me until the triptan drugs entered the market oral and nasal arent so effective for me i take the subdural injectable and my migraineno matter when in the arch of the headache i take itvanishes within 10 minutes including nausea it is unquestionably a powerful drug and i got a clearly necessary heart workup before i began taking it ive had chest pains from it however i recently discovered i could titrate the dose up to 13 of the vial and it is just effective recommend anyone taking the injectable form try this this drug saved me,"headache, nausea",1
60,i have gotten headaches and migraines my entire life i am 34 years old i have tried imitrex a few times and it made me nauseas finally got to the point where i could not handle them anymore and decided to use imitrex again so glad i did now it is the only thing that knocks my headaches and migraines out it attacks them on the spot and i can always count on it it is a magical pill,,0
61,i am a 30yearold female and i have gotten migraines since i was about 11 i have taken probably a dozen different medications for migraine from midrin to various pain medications even topamax as a preventative imitrex was the first medication i have taken that actually has the ability to stop my migraine headaches dead in their tracks i have been taking it for about 6 years now and i am writing this review now because were it not for imitrex i would be lying in bed right now in agony unable to do anything even open my eyes or listen to music or smell things without feeling nauseous every migraine is different and this one may not work for you but if you are thinking about give it a try i urge you to do so over the years this simple medication has saved me weeks of my life that i would have spent lying in bed totally useless i take a 50mg pill and my headache fades within 30 minutes let me tell you when you have a headache that could last for a day or more 30 minutes is nothing thanks whoever made this wonderful drug thank you so much,"headache, migraine, pain",1

63,i have suffered with bad headaches since childhood i didnt have many of the symptoms of migraine other than horrible pain from the back of my neck side top and front of my head including my face this pain would last for 48 hours or longer i am very allergic to all nsaids including aspirin so there was nothing i could do to relieve the pain until in my 40s a doctor gave me imitrex a miracle no only does it relieve all the pain in my head and neck it also relieves any other pain that i may have including arthritis pain it has given me back quality of life i often get loose bowels the next day after taking imitrex but its a small price to pay for pain relief that is the only side effect i have experienced,"arthritis, migraine, pain",1
64,this medication works very well for severe chronic migraines the only downfall i found was when taken after a long break from the medication it can cause dizziness and requires a decent amount of time to work im usually exhausted and take a nap when itshe so bad that i have to take this med but everytime i wake up the migraine is completely gone not great for a long term option but for young generally healthy people this seems to work really well for me when standard pain killers do not work,"dizziness, migraine, pain",1
65,i use 50mg to relieve my migraines and related symtomsit works within 45 minutesthe only side effect i can think of is right before it relieves the migrainethe pain increases to a level that is really badit lasts momentarily then the migraine is gonei also use the medicine for severe neck pain before a migrainealot of times that is enough to stop the migraine before it startsi have tried a lot of medicinesthis is the only one that worksso far i am able to use the generic variety with the same results,"migraine, neck pain, pain",1
66,when i started getting migraines a year ago it took me 7 months to actually take the imitrex i was told by 2 doctors that it was not a migraine headache but gave me an rx for vicodin as well as imitrex after trying the advil liquid gels motrin tylenol and excederine migrain i finally took the imitrex wow it works immediately yay now i can live my life i just hope they go away now,"headache, migraine",1
67,this drug changed my life over 10 years ago i used to spend 1 to 3 days in darkened room at least 3 times per month until a dr finally recommended this drug its very expensive but here is what i do i only need 50mg tablets so now i purchase 100mg and cut them in half a pharmacist friend of mine told me about this for years i was paying a fortune for this drug worth it but now it goes twice as far,,0
68,this is a miracle drug in my opinionif you are one that suffers from migraines this is certainly the drug you should takemigraine suferrers know when a headache is comingtake an imitrex it will never develope into a full blown migranethis drug is amazing,headache,1
69,imitrex has been a wonder drug for me i take a 100 mg tablet of imitrex when i first feel a migraine starting and it generally disappears within 30 mins occasionally it takes two doses to do the trick but normally one dose of imitrex does the trick the only odd side effect i experience is the feeling of pressure in my neck and slightly short of breath however the feeling typically passes within minutes,migraine,1
70,i suffer from migraine and cluster headaches primarily on the left side sometimes i will lose vision sometimes nausea and always light and sound sensitivity before the imitrex injections i would be bed bound for the duration of the migraine which would be an average of one to six days my headaches started right after the high school and twentyfive years later i still struggle with them for years i would try to avoid foods and evironments thinking they might cause my pain imitrex gave me the ability to live life my insurance covers some of the cost but it is worth the out of pocket expense to me,"migraine, nausea, pain",1

72,it works when nothing else will and it works without fail for me it does make me tired but then so do migraines not had any tolerability issues other than that its one of the few drugs ive ever taken that flatout does what its supposed to without major side effects or addictive potential,,0
73,at the first sign of a migraine i take 50mg of imitrex by mouth and within 15 min its gone i love this medicine for when i get a migraine two thumbs up for me,migraine,1
74,imitrex works wll as far as reducingelimating the mirgraine however the side effects for me make it difficult i get a tightness in my throat that can be very uncomfortable it also makes me sleepy i do much better if i take this med and then can sleep for a couple of hours i ususally take this med at night or if i dont get to the migraine soon enough and i know taking the maxalt wont knock the migraine out i keep both medications with me at all times,migraine,1
75,this treatment changed my entire way of getting through a migraineit helped cut down on my need for er visits dramatically i started taking the 50mg dose many years ago when i would feel a migraine coming on within an hour i had almost complete relief as the years went on my dr prescribed the 100mg pill which was much more effective worked within a half hour it works well for the pain of migraine as well as the nausea,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
76,ive suffered migraines for over 15 years finding imitrex gave me my life back before it i had tried every migraine drug known to man yet nothing else worked it also helps prevent migraines if you catch it in time and will stop a fullblown migraine when having a migraine i usually take 100 mgs lie down in a dark room in a few hours my migraine is gone sometimes i need to take another 50 mgs though it does make me have blurry vision for awhile be kind of confused very sleepy but this goes away after a few hours when migrianes is gone the side effects are worth not being laid up for 72 hours for me since i have 3 day migraines imitrex relieves nausea from migraine in usually 15 minutes to half hour after taking only thing i can complain about is this drug is outragously expensive and there is no generic at this time,"migraine, nausea",1
77,i have had migraines for 30 years and before imitrex they used to give me shots of demoral which only caused rebound headachesit never got rid of the i used get them so bad 3 days i would sleep on the floor in the bathroom i was so sick they robbed me of so many things and my quality of life was terrible imitrex has been a godsend to me the injections work the best i honestly dont know what i would do without it it has totally changed my life thank you,,0
78,this drug helped me at first i used it for all of my migraines i started with the tablets then tried the injectable form if i took the medication at the onset of my vision problems it would stop the headache from occurring it would take awhile for my vision to return to normal but i would not get the pain but if i was to late in taking the medicine then the pain would start and i was in for the long haul i have had 2 reactions to this drug that resulted to being hospitalized the first time was after taking the second dosage with my doctors approval we think claritind taken many hours earlier may have interacted with it that was a an emergency visit only the second time was a 9 day hospitalization due to the reaction i had between imitrex and antidepressants i had seen my doctor the day i took the imitrex and was given the ok to take the drug while on the other medications so be very careful,"headache, pain",1
79,it was very good for me at first it made me a lilttle whizzy but it work really well after that i would recommend it very highly,,0
80,a true blessing after 13 years imitrex continues to stop my migraines before they can even begin before that migraines with the horrible nausea were nearly disabling in my life ive rarely had to take a second dose for the same headache when i have needed to it was because i waited until the pain set in ive learned not to do that there has been no lessening of effect in all these years side effects are minimal if there is such a thing as a miracle drug imitrex is my miracle and im grateful,"headache, nausea, pain",1
81,imitrex works long term i have suffered from migraines for many years i take a daily 100mg or nuropin and only get a migraine every three months typically imitrex unlike other medications ive tried has worked for years and still delivers relief this is a rare find for mebecause ive tried most other meds and eventually they stop working,migraine,1

85,migraines i dont like the packaging and the injections work quicker but after years of trying to find a medication that actually took my migraine away i can live with the tablets being difficult to remove from the container ive suffered from migraines since 1972 and still do if i take one tablet and the migraine comes back then i take another i rarely have to take 3 i normally get a migraine a few times a week sometimes more frequently the injections gave me tightness in my throat and chest discomfort it eventually went away but when the tablets became available i requested them and even though they take longer to work id rather not use the injections,"chest discomfort, discomfort, migraine",1

87,stops my cluster headache for the moment when the clusters first hit me this is the med i take to knock out the pain then i can get it touch with the doctors office to get refills on carbamazepine and prednisone to hold off the pain for the following weeks through the cluster episode works for me,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1
88,imitrex great med if you take it right when you catch the migraine coming on it bothers my tummy but it is well worth the upset for the relief i get for my head the cost is ridiculous,migraine,1
89,imitrex injectable is my most effective treatment every time i have a cluster headache imitrex injectable always helps and usually abates it completely i always do get sideeffects flushing feeling of fullness in my face etc from my blood pressure rising from it but thats very minor to me compared to stopping my cluster attack i just now did a treatment on myself 6mg and it worked in about 1015 minutes within 12 hr i was back almost to normal again this is typical for my experiences with injectable imitrex,"cluster headache, flushing, headache",1
90,imitrex for migraine relief after starting on topa the oral tablet is not as effective as it was say maybe 7 or 8 years ago even then i may have been taking 50mgs back then too if 50mgs wasnt holding down the pain i would take another 50mg and that would help now i need to use the injection for relief,"migraine, pain",1

92,saved my life almost always worked within 1030 minutes have used on off for the last 6 years,,0
93,better than the er makes me tried but can be productive if need be some months are worse than others doctor are worried that i am using it too much i take about 20 pills a month on average better than going to the er all the time and better than getting all doped up on the narcotics,,0
94,side effects overwhelmed any reduction in migraine injection very painful and had frightening side effects related to heart palpitions and dizziness not sure it helped the migraine it certainly did not abort it,"dizziness, migraine",1
95,imitrex works i get clustermigraine headaches on my right temple all the time and i always try an otc drug first advil tylenol or aspirin nothing works though my doctor prescribed me imitrex about a year ago i like it because it always takes my headaches away but i always getting a flushing sensation as well it used to be really uncomfortable but now i am used to it my pharmacist said that i can cut the pill in half so i only take a half of the 100mg tablet i dont need the whole thing because its strong so the half works very well i see it as i would rather get flushed then be in pain i have also tried midrin which worked as well it doesnt flush me but it made me sleepy so i can not take it during the day at work etc so my vote is for imitrex,"flushing, pain",1

97,too expensive if the first tablet did not work needed to take more and it cost too much then it was 1200 per tablet and i had the headaches for weeks on end and several times a day,,0
98,rescue drug i preserve the shots for severe intractable migraines because the side effects are worse my legs feel very heavy my chest and throat feel very constricted i feel very weak the pills have fewer side effects when i entered the perimenopause menopause time of life i was having so many severe migraines and took so many imitrex etc that they stopped working as well after a few months i now try to take the triptans including imitrex as little as possible for that reason and because of potential for dangerous side effects listed now that i am getting older this is difficult when i cant seem to find an acceptable preventive that works without intolerable side effects i also absolutely have to work 40 hours a week so i cant be too loopy on pain meds either which my neurologist finally gave me because i was suffering so much he said it was standard practice to ask someone if they were suicidal before prescribing them a bunch of pain meds i told him i didnt want to kill myself but that sometimes i felt like cutting my head off when i had a migraine to stop the pain know what i mean,"menopause, migraine, pain",1
99,imitrex nowbut later i am on imitrex for headaches it took me a long time to actually find something that worked i am still using it today 2006 i believe i have clusterheadaches from what i have read my headaches have been a constant thing i get them about every day there are no sideeffects that i know of in the beginning it worked really well for me but i think that my headaches have not been fully addressed by doctors they really interrupt my day ive had other health problems to deal with though and thats probably why i havent gotten real relief from the imitrex it does take care of the pain you have at the moment but it doesnt prevent them from happening in the first place i havent come across a drug that can do this yet im hoping to try something else in the near future that would help if anyone reading this knows of something that would take these headaches away i would really appreciate it,pain,1
100,good and bad about the same time i received my first prescription april 2004 i figured out how to manage my migraines sometimes i fall a little short on my management and need an abortive therapy i went through 3 cards of 100mg 1 pill left it takes about 3045 minutes to start working and about 15 minutes to completely take the pain away the residual fog varies depending on how bad the pain was sometimes it completely takes away the migraine and sometimes it only lasts for about18 hours i traditionally have 3day migraines and have never had to take more than 4 imitrex and only did that once or twice i recently started taking 50mg and it takes an hour to hour and a half to start working the one migraine i have had since the switch came back 12 hours later took 3 doses before my management kicked in i hate the side effectspain in my upper arms dr said that just means it is working but i dont buy it i am concerned about the ramifications of long term use update 9266 i recently made a series of dr visits over 3 consecutive days due to a sudden case of vertigo my first the third day i woke up with a migraine so i took an imitrex eventually the pain went away on the previous visits they took my bp and it was something like 11772 11879 on the third day after taking the imitrex my bp was 168102 i have found that excedrin migraine is almost as effective as imitrex if taken early enough,"fall, migraine, pain, vertigo",1
101,changed my life for the better sumatriptan has enabled me to have an almost migraine free life after 35 years of suffering with migraines as often as 8 times per month and not wanting to be a guinea pig i heard about this drug and decided that this medication was worth a try if taken at the first sign of a migraine i find that within 1520 minutes the nausea all but disappears then shortly after that the pain and light sensitivity go away no more spending half my life laid up in a dark room with cold cloths or hot packs and a handy pail the only side effects i have experienced are slight fatigue but lying down for halfhour is still far preferable to days in bedand a dry mouth this passes after a few hours i know this drug doesnt work for everyone but if anyone reading this feels as i did no way do i want to be a guinea pig for the pharmaceutical industry rest assured things have come a long way sumatriptan is worth trying it has revolutionized my life and given me back the time with my family that was robbed before by migraines,"dry mouth, fatigue, migraine, nausea, pain",1
102,uased it several times but one night i used one of the shots and got a feeling like there was an elephant standing on my chest pain in my left arm sweaty feelings went away within 5 minutes but i threw away my remaining doses and never used it again no family history of anything cardiac at all my cholesterol and triglycerides are fine bp low etc even after extensive workup i had no indications of cad 11 years later i still dont but im thinking that i had read maybe even on the package insert about this med causing cardiac symtoms and problems in people without any hx or indicators for coronary heart disease maybe even a few heart attacks in those people wasnt there a lawsuit anyway to sum it up ill never touch it again,"chest pain, coronary heart disease, pain",1
103,imitrex my migraines have been through the roof on the pain scale lately i cant use imitrex anymore due to the fact that my blood pressure has been very high when i have a migraine and pain from fibromyalgia and other disorders and the last time i used it i had very bad reactions to it i thought my head was going to split open and i lost my hearing for about 2 hours this medication used to help alot but not anymore i just got some information on imitrex from harvard medical school regarding taking imitrex and ssris such as zoloft which i take the combination of these drugs causes serotonin syndrome this info was published july 2006 it can cause mental changes nerve and muscle symptoms temperature or vital sign control problems and digestive symptoms the site i got this from is wwwintelihealthcom it was very important info for me as the last time i had a migraine i took imitrex and had alot of the symptoms i printed this out and will be discussing it with my doc on my next visit very scaryat least for me,"fibromyalgia, migraine, pain, serotonin syndrome",1
104,best yet works great and fast most abortives in my recent history were not working so well with me but this one works 90 of the time and when it does not it is usually because i waited too long to take it as i am reluctant to overuse it i usually only need the one shot only occasionally have i used two in one day the side effects are the worst i dont feel the best when i am using it a bit dizzy and sick sometimes my heart rate goes funky on me i will note that since my inderal has been increased to 180 mg and i have been having some erratic heart rate problems taking imitrex has caused some dramtic slowing of my heart trouble breathing and chest pain so i would be careful when combining it with some of the preventatives which cause a drop in blood pressure and heart rate,"chest pain, pain",1
105,my holy grail the imitrex injection is my holy grail treatment medication it almost always works great for me i do experience some side effects such as lightheadedness and tingling in my body i also have to be strict about only periodically using it to avoid medication overuse headache i started using the product back in 1998 but i did have to stop using it for a while because it lost its effectiveness for me ive found this with other triptans too but i found that it regained its effectiveness for me if i used something else for a few months,"headache, lightheadedness, medication overuse headache",1
106,imitrex the best cure for a migraine that ive ever found the shot is faster and has somewhat harsher side effects than the pills but either one is a lifesaver i spent 10 days in the diamond headache clinic in chicago and could have saved a fortune by using imitrex after 9 years of off and on agony its been a blessing to have a drug that works so well costly but whats the price of your sanity and time,"headache, migraine",1
107,aggravated my asthma i found that everytime i used imitrex i would go into a severe asthma attack and have to go home from work and go on prednisone this was not very helpful at all,asthma,1
108,would not use again imitrex was the second prescription migraine med i ever tried after zomig it did relieve my migraine but it also gave me same major side effects as zomigtightness in my neck like i couldnt breathe made my whole body feel heavy i knew my day was over if i had to take itnot good with 4 kids in the house cost was high even with insurance as well finally asked doctor for something that wouldnt make me feel so terrible and would cost less and he prescribed midrin which works great and it lets me continue with my day migrainefree,migraine,1
109,no dice this seems like a placebo and even made my migraine worse,migraine,1
110,never did much for me my neurologist loves imitrex but i find it is hit or miss with real migraines i thought i would like the injection because i get vomiting with migraines and cant hold down a pill but at that point its too late for either to be effective i prefer maxalt but you have to take it very early on both have side effects that give me head rushes at the same time i need to lie down and nap for a while,vomiting,1
111,imitrex imitrex definitely takes the pain and nausea away however i become very sleepy and out of it feeling and cannot drive work or do much of anything but lie in bed once it kicks in it generally takes about an hour to work and on occasion i have experienced unpleasant side effects such as chest tightening heaviness and dizziness i tend to be sensitive to medications in general though i usually get relief with one dose at 25mg just wish i could take it and go to work rather than having to stay home i feel it kind of defeats the purpose of using medication,"dizziness, nausea, pain",1
112,works well works well if i take it when the migraine begins,migraine,1
113,imitrex is the best dont know what i would do wo we take the dose and cut it in half i dont need a full dose to abort my cluster if its a real bad one ill take 2 shots save alot of money ive had them 12 years now,,0
114,not sure i have been taking gabapentin300mg and verapamil240mg for about 3 months i have taken only 2 imitrexs during this time for visual auras and it didnt seem to helpalthoughi didnt get the headache after the auras,headache,1
115,imitrex almost always works on my migraines if i take it as soon as i feel a migraine starting its about 98 effective if i wake up with a migraine or dont take the imitrex right away then i sometimes have to take another 25mg within an hour or two of the first one for it to be effective sometimes it seems to wear off after about 12 hours and i sometimes have to take another one i have not had any side effects,migraine,1
116,works great but tightness in chest caused me to switch to another triptan also caused sore throat and some somnolence more cost effective than others because it comes on packages of 9 instead of 6,somnolence,1
117,heavy user works everytime for severe cluster attacks cannot tolerate full 6mg dose only 34 mg is needed,,0
118,imitrex was the first drug of its kind that i used imitrex was a lifesaver first time i could ever end the migraines before they got too bad my physician also would give me something for nausea and something for pain to kind of back it up and the combination worked pretty well,"nausea, pain",1
119,satisfied after imitrex came into my life yes imitrex works there were times that i had to give myself injections of imitrex but when it was finally determined what was setting off the migrains which was just about every day injections of imitrex were no longer necessary and now are treatable simply by taking the pill,,0
120,not worth the cost i took amerge when i felt a headache coming on i noticed no benifts i was also given imitrex shots wno relief the only thing that works for me is oxycodone for the pain i didnt experience any sideeffects,"headache, pain",1
121,it never fails greatest invention known to man however my doctor worries that with my high cholesterol i may be in danger of a heart attack,high cholesterol,1
122,hate it this kit tried repeatedly to satisfy both my neurologist and my insurance company was completely worthless to me it didnt help the pain it did give me a disturbing tingling sensation inside my head along with dizzyness and a lack of motor control its kind of what i imagine a stroke victim feels like accompanied by the pain of an active cluster attack it also seemed to cause rebound headaches that were even worse over the next several days,"pain, tingling sensation",1
123,short stay effects were never great only helped a little if at alland my body got used to the medication very quickly so that it did not work after a couple of weeks,,0
124,good results most of the time it works very well after taking a pill i feel worse for about half an hour then the headache usually disappears in one to three migraines i have to take another tablet after 6 hours a couple of times a year i get a very bad attack and then nothing helps,headache,1
125,imitrex this medicine has failed in helping my migraines very few times i hope to continue using this product for a very long time i love to use the statdose this works very well for me and i dont feel as nauseated with the shot as i do with the pills this medication is a godsend,,0
126,if you caught it quick enough it works w if you wake up with a bad one it doesnt help allot but if you get it quick enough tit works great,,0
127,no problems worked if it was taken before headache got severeno side effects,headache,1
128,excellent results i had tried everything for my migraines including midrin with no relief imitrex has been an absolute lifesaver for me the only issue i have is that i cannot give myself the shot must wait for my husband to come home from work in this case i take the 100 mg imitrex pill when i feel the beginning of my migraine it usually works,migraine,1
129,imitrex is a lifesaver before imitrex i had tried many medicines for migraines and none of the worked i would vomit during them so oral medicines would not work the first time i used an imitrex injection my headache was gone within half an hour the only side effect i noticed was a warm feeling in my chest but this went away within an hour a couple times the imitrex didnt work and i would go to the hospital and get a toradol shot almost always the injections take away the whole migraine i am very satisfied with imitrex,"headache, migraine",1
130,the only thing that works cant prevent them cant find out why i get them cant predict when ill get one but if i feel one coming on always behind the right eye imitrex is the only thing that works for me updatei have been trying lamictal for mild bipolar and have had only 3 headaches in the past 3 weeks not sure if im just luckyusually get 14 per week but ill keep yall posted in another month or so,,0
131,works for me imitrex has been the best treatment for my migraines i have struggled with migraines since the age of twelve and worked my way through anacin excedrininderal and midrin before my obgyn suggested the imitrex injections while the injections are not pleasant they are definitely better than the headache today i simply use the tablet form i have embraced healthy eating habits and exercise regualarly but am still suspectible to attacks due to stress or particularly weather changes i do work with a neurologist now and feel that im in very good hands i would offer one word of caution though i tried using topomax to ward off headaches and it was highly successful however i became so forgetful that i was unable to do my job effectively i had to forgo the topomax for quality of life couldnt just go drifting along thats when i realized that i would have to stay with imitrex and just accept that i will always have to carry some with me,"headache, stress",1
132,rebound headaches been using im since 1989 works greatmy question can long term use and frequent use cause migraines,,0
133,imitrex the imitrex injections helped within minutes it is a wonderful thing i will say however that sometimes the side effects were not pleasant for me at least it would cause my blood pressure to go up to where i felt uncomfortable about it my head would feel a little tingly as it was working but getting past the side effects the imitrex injections are very effective and helpful,,0
134,imitrex i thought i would die w my 1st dose i suffer from chronic panicanxiety attacks as well as migranes that are 34 times per week now my 1st dose made me vomit and brought on a anxiety attack as well did it help the migraineyes but it sure wasnt worth the side effects,"anxiety, anxiety attack",1
135,miracle drug i was not introduced to imitrex till i was 40 what a shame for the years when i lost a week of every month to migraines i had to go to europe for a doctor to finally think to introduce me to it almost always works with one dose no side effects tired afterwards but not sure if thats the drug or the headache,headache,1
136,didnt do a thing for me imitrex didnt do a thing for my headaches cut the 100mg pill in half as the higher dose gave me too much tight chestness was mild with 50mg didnt have any other negative side effects though it just didnt work for me unfortunately,,0
137,imitrex injections used 23mg dose up to twice a day always relieved my headache within 20 minutes never prevented subsequent headaches when taking it the subsequent headaches seemed more painful discontinued the medication when i discovered my blood pressure usually in normal range increased to 185110 after a dose of imitrex cost of injectable imitrex is obscene and the usual packaging is designed to maximize the profits of the drug company this med is the poster child for nationalizing the us pharmaceutical industry,headache,1
138,imitrex injections this stuff is gold it works like magic for me but at 50 per dose the cost stinks,,0
139,imitrex injections imitrex injections work for me about 99 of the time to stop an attack in 5 7 minutes i usually use a 12 shot i rarely have any side effects and when i do they are mild and much preferrable to a ch attack neither the frequency nor the severity of my attacks have increased since using imitrex the only drawback i can really find with imitrex is the cost i cannot afford the injections without insurance and my insurance aetna sucks only provides me with 4 statdose kits per month even though my doctor has documented my need for higher quantities and has written letters of medical necessity they have denied every appeal did i mention aetna sucks this leaves me being very selective on which attacks i try to abort meaning i ride out a lot of attacks,,0
140,injections the only effective abortive i have found at 2mg3mg per injection,,0
141,immitrex injections imitrex did nothing for me but seems to work well for others i used the injections for a long time before i realized it was just the attacks leaving on their own it also greatly increased the lengths of my cycles,,0
142,imigranimitrex it works in about 510 minutes however i have always used it as a last resort as i hate the way it makes me feel also i do absolutely believe it prolongs cycles it has a very short half life and is a dinosaur of a triptan i personally wouldnt recommend it to my ex husbandwell actually i might but i detest him,,0
143,increases frequency of attacks lengthens episodes if i had to use a medication several times a day every day for years to stop clusters i would not think i had found a wonder drug but something that had turned me into a chronic i want somethng that will not only kill the headache but kill the episode not make it last for years,headache,1
144,imitrix i have used up to 20mg ns 4x day every day for years and had no problems except increased anxiety attacks it works as fast as a shot does and is very effective,anxiety,1
145,imitrex first time i tried it was via epipen about four years ago which was horrible oral tablets provide effective relief but this triptan gives me the worse side affects fatigue spaciness and especially muscle pain,"fatigue, pain",1
146,works the first time about every time imitrex was the miracle for my life once i started using the imitrex injection for my migraines there was no turning back i started using it in 1996 and had have been using it ever since normally i can overcome a severe migraine with a single dose sometimes i have to use a followup within a couple hours to keep working through the day i have found that sometimes if i take imitrex more than three days in a row i can get rebound migraines just from the imitrex so i have to just go it alone with excedrin for 2436 hours to stop the rebounds i have tried the oral imitrex and other oral triptans but my stomach seems to shut down when i have an oncoming migraine so no amount of oral medication helps me under this circumstance my goal over the past years has been to find my daily medication to reduce the number of imitrex injections per month due to the cost i went through all of the basic meds such as midrin inderal etc until i finally came across topamax you can read my rating there i reduced my imitrex use by about 80 with this i think all of us migraine sufferers just need to be patient and take the time to find our daily meds to combat these nasty things we were dealt and enjoy the good days when we have them i looked for my proper meds for 25 years and i hope they keep working for me,migraine,1
147,imitrexmigraine i did not find it to be helpful at all,,0
148,imitrex works about 60 of the time if i drink a lot of water with the tablet the side effect of a worse headachenausea is eliminated,,0
149,kind of works but not 100 it seems to help get rid of an attack but overall i dont feel better off very expensive and insurance is always a battle,,0
150,imitrex it works effectively for me but i hate the rise on blood pressure although mine is pretty low anyway and the heart pounding i also get very warm but it takes away the pain and that makes side effects like thse worth it nanp,pain,1
151,imitrex the imitrex injection has proved to be the most effective medication for my migraines,,0
152,imitrex it has worked well for me id love to have access to a less expensive generic form,,0
153,imitrex made me dizzy lightheaded spacey as non functional as the headache itself insignificant headache relief,headache,1
154,initial success with imitrex after tightness in my chest which my doctor told me not to worry about unless it lingered my migraine eased before it ever became severe after a little over a year though i found that it now longer seemed to work and i have now switched to relpax which seems to be working very well for me,"migraine, worry",1
155,cluster headaches i just recently started to get cluster headaches at first they began during intercourse instead of a climax i got a headache that nearly made me faint because the pain is so severe i saw a doctor and he gave me imitrex told me to take it one hour before relations then the headaches started without having relations it took approx 30 minutes to start working but as i lay still on the bed i could physically feel the medication starting to do its job i felt exhausted after the headache went away but pain free,"headache, pain",1
156,imitrex shot the imitrex shot is very effective and fast it eliminates my migraines 98 of the time after about 15 minutes if your stomach can no longer tolerate oral migraine medicine like imitrex tablet maxalt etc try the shot dont be frightened off by the shot it is not like the shots you get at the doctor it is a special dosage pen that only goes about 14 into your skin and it is automatic ie you dont have to move your hand to stick yourself finally it is much more effective than the nasal spray,migraine,1
157,i couda had a life i am 55 years old and have had migraines since childhood if imitrex had existed when i was younger life would have been much easier it is the only med that has consistantly worked for me and i have tried pretty much everything i have numerous triggers am prone to rebound and have other neurological problems it no longer works as well as it did when i first used it and i have to use the shots when i have nausea but it still beats anything else out there as far as i am concerned,nausea,1
158,thank heaven for imitrex ive tried several of the triptans and they were ok but imitrex is wonderful one of the best points about imitrex tablets is that if its a stubborn migraine and a tablet doesnt do the job theres still the option of using an injection this is the only triptan that offers this option the injections may be a bit on the expensive side but they generally give me relief within 15 minutes and are far easier and less expensive than a trip to the er now that i have heart disease i can no longer take imitrex i really miss it,migraine,1
159,imitrex hi my name is stacy and i am 37 years old imitrex just gives me more heafaches zomig zomig zmt and axert works the best for me now,,0
160,imitrex injections changed my life i havent had a migraine in two years after thise shots if i start to get one i simply take two alleve now with a diet coke or a sudafed and its gone before its starts imitrex stopped the occurance and helped me get over my fear of going out and enjoying life try the injections easy to use for me it workes better than the pills be prepared to rest for the day as it makes you sleepy but the benefits drastically outweigh the short term sideeffects good luck,"fear, migraine",1
161,imitrex i have been using imitrex on off for many years there are times when it works and other times when it doesnt i continue to use it because it is the only effective drug that i have found so far that helps with the headaches,,0
162,imitrex this does not work for me it made my headaches worse,,0
163,works most of the time my migraines headaches are weird they dont throb but are a sharp pain above my right eye that can be persistent until it annoys me enough to do something about then i take my imitrex and close my eyes for a while and the pain subsides for quite a while,pain,1
164,imitrex has been a godsend imitrex saved me without it the quality of my work and home life would be greatly diminished ive been taking it since 1998 and it still works i havent had to up my dose either i average about 9 migraine days per month usually one 25mg tablet will knock a headache out within an hour of taking it about half the time the headache comes back 24 hours later but i seldom have to take more than 2 imitrex tablets per episode and the episodes seldom last more than 2 days not only does the drug knock out the headaches but i actually get a slight lift from it i am fortunate i dont have any side effects at all the only downside of this drug is the cost especially since its not in generic form yet ive worked around this by having my doc prescribe 50 mg tabs which is the standard dose anyway and i use a pill cutter to divide them the insert says do not cut pills in half but i always do and my head hasnt fallen off they make it hard to do this by making the pills in triangular form i think its their way to prevent people from doing it anyway it cuts my cost in half since i can get twice the amount for the same cost if i cut the pills in half,"headache, migraine",1
165,imitrex used butalbitol for about a year with mixed results frequently had to supplement that with sinusallergy pain medicine imitrex usually works with no additional meds needed it hasnt caused any side effects either such as making me feel dopy or sluggish which is what happened when i used stadnol nasal spray,pain,1
166,not worth the risk imitrex sometimes helps sometimes doesnt i use it only as a last resort i found half a dose is enough for me my former physician told me to take 3 doses and it caused rebound migraines for days the risks are just not worth taking this drug extreme drowsiness sometimes bone thinning and heart problems id rather take some lemon balm melissa wood betony white willow bark and get some sleep,drowsiness,1
167,imitrex i have been using imitrex for a while it dose help if i use it right when i feel the migraine start if i wait too long then it does not help as much,migraine,1
168,imitrexmagnesiumsuntheanine ive used imitrex 50mg for many years i find it works best if i take it when i feel the precusor of a migraine comingyawning every minute or so 50mg stops it from happening i have found 7 causes of my migraines too much caffeine chocolate theobromine in some chocolatesinstant headache salt lack of fresh air not enough water too much cinnamon not taking the mineral magnesium daily magnesium gluconate 250500mg daily helps prevent migraines iit is also good for the heart muscles nerves and blood pressure suntheanine ltheanine will stop the weird buzz of caffeine stay awake anyways prevent the headache make sure it says suntheanine on the bottle otherwise the contents are synthetic ltheanine which causes awful headaches on occasion when ive had a 23 day whopper of a migraine as a last resort i call silent unity a nondenominational prayer line at 18006697729 or 8169692000 out of usa online at their prayers always work they dont ask for money although i contribute because of the great help and they will pray for youanyone or situation 24 hours x 30 days intensive healing prayer i hope that helps you my fellow sufferers,"headache, migraine",1
169,works in certain cases im on my second try with this drug after a former trial some years ago where it worked about half the time and made me feel too druggy they also restrict it tightly my former doc would only give me 4 or 6 which is a joke whats different now is that im on a constant maintenance dose of another pain medication and my headaches are fewer in number when they do come i believe the medication already in my system duragesic gives the imitrex a little boost now it works almost every time i take it with few second doses needed side effects imitrex usually gives me a brief period of a racing heart feeling some strage itchiness tingling in various body parts then after about an hour i feel spaced out drowsyexhausted but the pain is gone or lessened i cant go do a bunch of stuff on imitrex but some people ive talked to are just like new after taking it its very expensive and both doctors insurance tightly restrict how much you can have if you pay out of pocket there many better choices,pain,1
170,imitrex ive been taking midrin for years and have had no problems but a few months back i got the worst migrane i have ever had midrin did not help at all after suffering for 5 days and a trip to the er i was given imitrex after about an hour which is nothing compared to 5 days of suffering i felt much better its a bit expensive so i only use it when my first dose of midrin doesnt do anything,,0
171,imitrex injections imitrex is the only thing that works on my migraines i take the injections so they can be a hassel to carry around i dont like the feeling i get once i take the imitrex kind of like a tingling sensation and flutter feeling in my chest but it just lasts a little while,tingling sensation,1
172,imitrex very effective but i use as a last resort due to the inconvenience of injections and the initial side effects,,0
173,imitrex good but if used too often i found rebound headaches i also had the odd occasion it didnt workbut usually when taken i am fine and back to my old self in 30 min,,0
174,works pretty well for me i like it pills and injections are ok but nasal spray is too nasty,,0
175,headaches as you can tell the imitrex shots did not work the only relief i get is from cafergot supportories,,0
176,imetrex for migraine headaches before imetrex i suffered from migraines for over twenty years without relief imetrex is most effective when taken at the onset of a migraine so i keep one with me at all times food triggers must still be watched as avoiding certain foods and drinks sugarladen foods red wine beer especially will trigger a migraine for me i dont take the 100 mg tablets because they make me feel spacey the only down side of imetrex for me is my insurance will only cover 9 tablets a month and if i have more than 9 headaches in 31 days im outta luck and medication,migraine,1
177,imitrex i have been using imitrex injection for approximently 10 years in those 10 years the headache is completely gone within 1530 minutes with only 1 injection and with no side affects only 2 or 3 times i have had to follow with a second injection in an hour for it to work its like i never had one to begin with the thought of an injection doesnt please me but it is a selfinjector and you dont even see the needle when the dosage goes into the body it stings a bit the cost is extremely high and now i no longer have insurance so dont know how much longer i can continue to use my miracle cure i have tried imitres tablets with maybe 50 or less satisfaction they too are priced high but i can get these in mexico in a box of 9 for about 18 the injections are not available in mexico,headache,1
178,imitrex nasal spray imitrex worked well for several years i didnt use it unless it was absolutely necessary then it stopped working on the pain although it still stopped the nausea i liked it because i could take it and pretty much go on about my business,"nausea, pain",1
179,works great with no side effects ive tried all 3 forms of imitrex and the pills are the form that i use the most the nasal spray leaves a really nasty after taste that i can do without and they dont give me relief much faster than the pill so i dont mess with them i can take an initrix pill and if ive caught the migraine before its full blown the pill i can feel it working with in 3045 minutes the injection is wonderful for those migraines that sneak up on you really fast or come on while you are sleeping ive found that those usually have gone to far painwise to respond to the pill form but the injection knocks them out the injection itself really isnt that big of a deal its a small penlooking device with a really small needle and its relatively painless its not very cost effective to use the injection form as your primary abortive but they are handy to have in addition to the pills for the hummdingers that dont respond to anything else the only side effect i can say i have is an awareness or minor tightnening feeling as the medicine starts working this causes me no discomfort though so i hate to call it a side effect id also like to clarify that some things like tiredness feeling hung over etc that people are contributing as side effects of their migraine medications are actually alot of times whats called the postdrome of a migraine or simply stated the after effects of the migraine itself they would have felt this way whether they had taken any medication or not,"discomfort, migraine",1
180,works but beware of addiction i used immigran some years i was very happy that i could be boss of my agenda again and stop the attacks when there was something important to do i had 1 to 2 times a mont a migraine day but througout the years i got more often migraines less severe not twice a month but once a week and later twice a week still easy treateble with immigran i started to use injections for the severe attacks and the tablets for the weekly ones later till one month ago i was using immigran 4 to 5 times a week if i had the courage not to use it for a week or two it worked wonderwell again this is an addiction i felt worse nausea and light but steady 24 hours headache good medication but beware if your headaches get more frequent i will now after a bad experience with depakine begin with topamax which is now working well for a week,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
181,imitrex 50 mg tabs i have tried alot of meds to try to gedt rid of my headache and i have found that imitrex has worked best for me,headache,1
182,a real godsend ive suffered from migraines since my early teens im 49 now which became less frequent after a hysterectomy but still the occasional migraine is torment i am on heavy duty narcotics for chronic back pain and nothing ive ever tried has worked on migraine pain my dr prescribed imitrex and with the exception of one occasion when it only took away about 50 of the pain yesterday in fact it works 100 of the time for me if i take it right away the pain is gone before i know it instead of suffering for sometimes days in bed highly recommend,"back pain, migraine, pain",1
183,imitrex imitrex always works for mebut then the migraine can come back after 812 or 24 hours so my doctor didnt like me taking it daily i once had to take it daily to twice daily for 7 weeks straight that time the migraines were triggered by sweet kosher wine no more wine for me my doc fears i will have a stroke or heart attack from so much imitrex at my age61 but i now dont take it virtually at all since we have figured out a preventive meds strategy with the neurologist,migraine,1
184,imitrex it does work but not always to a sure point of the headache i have to take it at least three taplets for the headaches to go away which isnt good to take that many of tablets for the dam headache i think,headache,1
185,imitrex i suffered with migraines for many years i had taken over the counter drugs but they did not put a dent in the pain one doctor gave me darvocet and phenegran but it just made me out of it and still the headache was there then a friend told my husband about imitrex so i found a new doctor and she gave me the most wonderful medicine i have ever taken i used to be sick for 1 to three days with nausea and voimiting but with imitrex i am up and running in an hour or so i am grateful that i have insurance so the cost is not so outrageous,"headache, nausea, pain",1
186,it flows through my veins i love imitrex it has been the only thing that has ever worked for me 100 on the pain it works 99 of the time i use it it works within 20 minutes from the time i take it the only side effect other than the initial pinch of the needle is drowsiness while the drug is acting on the migraine i am talking only about injections here ofcourse no one likes sticking a needle in themselves and when you do it as often as myself you need to make sure you move around injection sites to prevent clotting this drug has given me some of my life back hours and hours of it,"clotting, drowsiness, migraine, pain",1
187,imitrex i swear you become immune to each triptan after using it for a couple of years i am now using relpax which works the best for me,,0
188,imitrex by injection i can have relief within a 12 hour,,0
189,imitrex is a life saver ive had migraines since i was in my teens imitrex is the only medication i have ever taken that actually stopped a migraine in its tracks i just wish it was more affordable,migraine,1
190,imitrex worth the money i say definitelythis is the last resort for me before the neurologists called it quits with the triptans i use it at least once a week usually more than that it usually works within the hournot always though,,0
191,med for migraine pain this was one med that was a miracle worker if you caught the pain before it got unbearable only downside was the drainage going down the back of the throat but oh well if it worked,"migraine, pain",1
192,imitrex imitrex can be effective however at times i have found that it has not helped at all the only side effect is that it makes me drowsy,,0
193,horrible stuff i had a horrible doctor who thought this was the only drug for migraine it never worked the first two times i used it my doctor told me it was the only thing she would give the third time i had a serious episode where my throat closed upand my chest felt crushed and i thought i was going to die she still wanted me to take a drug which didnt work and which almost killed me some doctors should be in a different profession this drug may be good for others but many migraine sufferers dont do all that well on it there is too much hype and it is so expensive the drug company just wants to sell and sell without regard to the fact that many migraine patients do terribly on this drug this also prevents good medications from not being used by ignorant doctors who think only triptans work for migraines,migraine,1
194,use of imitrex injections i have found little to no relief from using imitrex injections with the cost factor taken into consideration i would have to say from personal use that there is no significant difference in the headaches,,0
195,free at last a miracle drug after suffering for months an episode that had me thinking i was going to have a stroke when my doctor gave me samples of imitrix last august wow i cant believe there is something out there that actually workshoweverbecause of the high cost close to 2000 per pill it limits me being able to purchase i work for a healthcare system that offers no rx benefits just discount at pharmacy yeah whatever and as single working parent i fall between the cracks for assistanceso unfortunatly i ususally have to just suffer but when i can afford the rx this is a wonder drug,fall,1
196,imitrex imitrex is a miracle drug and a god send for me as i became addicted to rx pain meds that i was taking due to frequent migraines the only problem ive had is that the insurance company only covers 9 tablets per month and i was having 1220 migraines per monthi say was because i am now taking a preventative migraine med called topamax every 3 months imitrex sends me coupons and a newsletter and the newsletter always stresses taking the imitrex at first sign of migraine sure at 1500 a tab actually i shouldnt complain imitrex has taken me from laying in excruciating pain one minute to eating pizza with my family 15 minutes later who would have thought thanks,"migraine, pain",1
197,imitrex succeeds i have between 23 migraines a week for over 30 years imitrex works well but i need to be careful about rebound headaches if i get a migraine more than two days in a row i try using a painkiller for 24 hours before taking imitrex again so as to break the cycle i have no negative side effects one positive one is that i can concentrate better,migraine,1
198,imitrex i couldnt take imitrex for my migraines unfortunately because it caused me severe pain in my jaw,pain,1
199,imigran nasal spray i have been using imigran nasal spray for about three years i find it effective if i can use it soon after the onset of a migraine if i leave it for too long it doesnt work as well usually it takes about 20 minutes for the imigran to work i have tried many different drugs over a 30 year period for my migraines none of which were much help the imigran works pretty well my neurologist suggested taking 3 soluble aspirins when a migraine starts this is reasonably effective but i worry about the effects of the aspirin in a largish quantity,"migraine, worry",1
200,no help from imitrex i used the pill the nasal spray and the injection penno help at all i used this several years ago for about 3 months that was three months of hell,,0
201,imetrex ns imetrex is an absolute god send ive tried every migraine medication know to man and this is by far the best however it is ridiculously expensive and the side effects can sometimes be scary ie severe heart palpitations the ns works well when nauseous because theres nothing to keep down and the injection gave me frightening side effects where i swore i was having a heart attack i also experienced tightening of the throat with the injection needless to say i no longer use the injections the tablets work with a moderate migraine but when i am vomiting theyre obviously are a complete waste no pun intended the only time imitrex does not work well is when i wake with a severe migraine then it takes two doses with a second medication such as a narcotic and can take most of the day to abort the headache,"headache, migraine, palpitations, vomiting",1
202,imitrex i didnt realize i was suffering from migraines initially since i also have sinus headaches quite frequently and some of the symptoms are similar i reached a point where i was having migraines 4x a week unable to work or even get out of bed i went to my pcp who prescribed imitrex pills imitrex did not seem to work quickly for me or give me complete relief i was then given inderal which is generally taken for high blood pressure and told to take that on a daily basis to possibly help prevent the frequency of migraines and if i did feel a migraine coming on to take the imitrex then that also did not work for me working for a physicians office i decided to ask for another opinion on meds for migraines i was told to try relpax relpax 40mg works very well for me generally within a short period of time if i catch the migraine quickly enough i have experienced no side effects as for cost effectiveness most migraines meds are costly and my insurance co approves only 6 pills a month which seems to be the norm fortunately i do have a small copay for my scripts but i have to watch since i can get only 6 a month if i had a bad month i generally call my pcp for samples,"migraine, short period",1
203,imitrex i have had migraines for the past 20 years nothings seems to work i even work in a hospital i worked on a neurosurgical floor which has turned into a open heart floor everyone can tell when i am having a migraine sometimes i think it is my job due to it being very stressful i keep hoping and praying some miracle will happen that would stop migraines for ever,migraine,1
204,imitrex pills and injections ive used imitrex pills and injections for over 15 years as needed the 50 mg pill usually does it if i take it early enough if i wake up with the migraine in the time i get up to take the pill it often escalates to double the migraine just because of the blood flow change in standing when its a level 10 migraine i take the injection which works 90 of the time within 2530 min the drug can make you feel sleepy or a little dragged out but at least i can work rather than in all that pain getting enough sleep is critical to helping your body not be susceptible to the migraines,"migraine, pain",1
205,imitrex nasal spray this spray made me really sick and cost a lot of money it didnt work on my migraines and was a waste of money,,0
206,imitrex for migraines this medication seems to work great for neurological migraines for me there are two down sides one is the difficulty in opening the package when i am in acute pain the second is it tends to make me a bit tired after taking it however if i have a choicei choose to not be in pain i will take this anyday over demoral since i am in a stupor for 23 days after,"acute pain, pain, stupor",1
207,imitrex this is the only medication that helps my headaches the headache sometimes returns and i have to take it again but it has been a great relief when nothing else helps,headache,1
208,imitrex when this first came out it was a godsend to me it literally changed my life forever my migraines especially the menstrual ones more often than naught would last up to an entire week in duration with the whole hiding in a dark room with my head packed in ice and vomitting my guts out with the occasional trip to your nonfriendly emerg dept for a shot of demerol to knock me out type scenario not once i began using the imitrex injections sure it took some getting used to giving oneself an injection which hurts like hell initially when the drug flows out of the syringe into your body and accepting the weird spreading firelike feeling immediately following accompanied by nauseathese are really only momentary symptoms which pass quickly and then voilawithin 15 minutes to a half hour laterno more migraine i loved it moved on after a few years though to a pill zomig which i continue to use to this day but actually do not need very much anymore i had a hysterectomy with double oopherectomy which took care of the menstrual migraines and i had food intolerance testing done so as long as i avoid those foods and substances which my body was found that it cannot personally handle i rarely ever get migraines anymore yippee,"food intolerance, migraine",1
209,imitrex my reaction to imitrex is so negative that i list it as a drug allergy now the oral was not effective and left me feeling gittery but the injection which the doctor insisted i try even though the oral had not been effective made me want to kill someone i became aggressive anxious paranoid i had tremors sob racing heart when the doctor came in to check my reaction he saidwell i guess you were right about this med and so sorry we cant give you something to counteract it you will just have to ride it out then he left and never came back,,0
210,sumatriptan its good for my daily headaches but not so hot for the big migraines when they occur side effects are some slight tingling when hands are placed in hot water and all food tastes much better,,0
211,tablets ok shots better at times when i caught my migraines before they became too severe the imitrex tablets worked pretty well although i usually had to take 2 within 30 minutes but if i waited too long i usually needed an injection sometimes 2 i was afraid to take this medication too often because of the warning about it being hard on the heart,,0
212,imitrex didnt work for me,,0
213,ugh never again ive been suffering from migraines for at least 10 years and finally have consulted my doctor about them she suggested the imitrex as the first pill to try the day that i took the first one i started to feel nauseous but within an hour or so the migraine seemed to have subsided the next time i took it the onset was far worse than the previous time and i knew that it was going to be a doozey of a migraine the imitrex made me so nauseous i was having the dry heaves and on top of it the pain seemed to go from the front of my forehead to the back of my head i couldnt even lie down as it seemed to be so tender on the back of my head terrible experience with this one,"migraine, pain",1
214,imitrex wasnt effective i tried imitrex actually ive done the injection nasal spray and pill form and it didnt help it did however give me this head rush feeling that managed to make my head hurt worse than when i started,,0
215,imitrex tabs 25 50mg ive had migraine since age 19 and they always revolved around my menstrual cycle until the advent of imitrex nothing helped me unfortunately im one of the unlucky people who has continued to get migraine after menopause and they have become much more frequent 4 to 9 a month the imitrex is like a miracle but i am now worried about the possible cardiovascular side effects as i am now in my sixties and the headaches are getting more and more frequent i also feel that though the imitrex still works fairly well that i am left feeling very done in for the remainder of the day im considering trying another brand of triptan when i see a new neurologist i have also tried several preventive medicines with no luck so far because of side effects i am just starting a pediatric dose of depakote to see if i can tolerate it,"menopause, migraine",1
216,imitrex i found imitrex was only useful to ease the initial migraine i would take amerge at the same time because by the time the amerge kicked in the imitrex stopped working i did not find it helped with rebound migraines,migraine,1
217,not relieving di im a 37 yr old female with 9 yrs of headaches migraines i heard this one worked so well on others thats my last of many drs gave it a try i tried imitrexs for several months with a back up of relpaxs this is one that works with imitrax 100 mg a try made my migraines worse after 20 minsthese are meds that worked the best midrin relpaxs and then botox injections and last a micro scopic nerve surgery read my profile under topmaxs im telling the world i have my life back ,surgery,1
218,best so far normally i can take one dose of imitrix and the pain is gone within half an hour a caution is that it makes you dizzy and sometimes drowsy i also found out later that you have an increased risk of seziures if this medication is taken with effexor or effexor xr,pain,1
219,migraine and imitrex injection this was my first used triptan med i didnt mind the inconvenience of the injection i was just so happy to use something that stopped the migraine regularly at first i was switched to the tablet when it was available and it worked well for several years before losing effectiveness for me,migraine,1
220,imitrex i did not find it effective for me only felt slight relief for a migraine this is not much tried it only twice and went to something else,migraine,1
221,triptans and i dont get along i tried imitrex and zomig once each at different times for migraine headaches both times the headache became much worse to the point where i had to leave work and go to bed i wasnt taking any other medications at the time so there shouldnt have been any interactions i guess triptans just dont work for me,"headache, migraine",1
222,it works well on migraines for me anyway i use the injection kit point and press the button and it works well i have to be ready to lay down immediately though for several hours in a dark room as it is fastacting and gives me a head rush followed by a heavy feeling that i just want to immediately lay down and not move but when i wake up the migraine is gone it works best if you can take it when the pain is bad but not unbearable if i wait too long then i end up needing the 2nd dose as i wake up and still have the migraine usually i will try to hold out until right before bed going to bed early and then i wake up fresh and headache free in the morning,"headache, migraine, pain",1
223,so far imitrex has worked very well for me i get migraines about twice a week more or less depending on well no one really knows what it depends on but imitrex works wonders for me even in small doses since i started taking it the number of days ive had to stay home in bed has dropped to almost none i do worry about its effects of longterm use though and running out just when you need it is never good i have to check every time i go out that i have at least one tab with me i plan on finding a preventative medication soon but i will keep the imitrex on hand at all times,worry,1
224,didnt work so well imitrex only completely got rid of my headache 1 out of 4 times i took it half the time it didnt do anything and another 14 the time it lessened the pain but didnt get rid of it completely also i suffered from drowsiness and dry mouth after i took it,"drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, pain",1
225,imitrex effectiveness for me it only worked about onefourth of the time but when it did it took away the headache within twenty minutes,headache,1
226,cant be sure on this one i tried imitrex tabs in the past and i dont remember them working for me i have also tried the injection and i recall it actually making the migraine worse ive now gotten some samples of the nose spray which i will try next time i get a migraine,migraine,1
227,miracle with strings attached when i first began taking imitrex for incapacitating migraines i wanted to bow down and kiss the feet of its inventor nothing before or since has ever worked so well but after the first few doses i began to have chest pains i have a family history of heart trouble but nothing wrong personally so i continued taking it finally one day the pain got so bad that i considered calling 911 additionally my niece had told me that her 34 yo neighbor had undergone a heart transplant and there was nothing wrong with her heart prior to her use of imitrex and then one of my nieces coworkers who was also an imitrex user got a migraine and did what she had done many times before gave herself the injection she was found dead in her office a heart attack at age 39 so as amazingly effective as the med is for easing a migraine and leaving you functional rather than dopey i have backed way off from it because of the heart issues,"found dead, migraine, pain",1
228,imitrex easy fast effective too expensive insurance limits my supply to one pack 9 tabs a month,,0
229,loooove imitrex hey guys i absolutely love the imitrex injection i hate having to give myself a shot and yeah theyre not the cheapest but holy cow do they work fast they do make me a little tired but most of the time when i have a migraine thats how i feel anyway i highly recommend imitrex injections,migraine,1
230,imitrex review i love imitrex pill form i have also used imitrex in injection form and did not like the results,,0
231,imitrex injectible ineffective as is all the imitrex products for my type of migraine headachemigrainosis,migraine,1
232,imitrex was a life saver for me i have used imitrex injections since 1999 and they have worked 99 of the time i have only had to use a 2nd injection 4 or 5 times over the last 6 years in february 2003 i began taking topamax which miraculously reduced the incidence of migraines in my life imitrex was just as effective for the ones i still have the only side effect i have noticed is immediately after the injection my neck becomes somewhat stiff and tender and i become somewhat lightheaded the imitrex is usually effective in about 45 minutes imitrex works for me even when the migraine has been around for a day although sometimes i have a dull headache after using the drug if i wait that long to use the imitrex to control the migraine but the migraine is gone before i took topamax i never went anywhere without the imitrex injector in my purse luckily my insurance covers this cost ease of use is an 8 because i dont like needles but this shot is always worth the sting hope this helps someone else,"headache, migraine",1
233,imitrex this medication really works if i take it soon enough first sign of migraine i do get side effects though total brain fog and tiredness but that wears off after a couple of hours caffeine helps also chocolate smile i do get concerned because i take it so often at least twice a week every week for several yrs,migraine,1
234,imitrex seemed to make my headache worse my headache is primarily in the right rear of my head most of the time when i took imitrex the headache seemed to spread and the whole back of my head would be in pain it did help a few of the times i tried it but i would have to take it at first sign of a headache,"headache, pain",1
235,triptans are cruel the triptan type meds are by far the worse for me the side effects were worse than the migraine it self it got rid of my migraine dont get me wrong but it made me feel like i was dying a slow cruel death i would not recommend this to my worst of enemies i tried all of them maxalt zomig and imitrex my doctor said to never take them again because i had a mri done and at some point in time i had a small stroke and he believes it was from the triptans so people be careful with those drugs,"death, migraine",1
236,did not help this med did not even touch my migraine i had to rely on otc tylenol pm to just make me go to sleep and not interfere w imitrex med will never recommend to anyone,migraine,1
237,works good for me i have been on imitrex injections for a couple of years and it works great there is a tightness of chest but that goes away within 5 minutes and after just sitting in my recliner for about 15 minutes my migraine is gone i have been on several other drugs and this one works great for me i am also on nubain injections just in case i dont have any imitrex at home i would suggest this drug to anyone who suffers from massive migraines,migraine,1
238,not for everyone imitrex didnt help me,,0
239,imitrex injections i waited for years for this medicine and actually got it when i was in the study it was effective for a short period of time the side effects were terrible the headache would move to the back of my head and it would feel like an elephant was sitting on my chest i would also get heart palpitations from it i know that this is a helpful drug for some but not me the worst part about this drug is that since all the advertisements for itpeople including doctors think that all migraine sufferers have a wonder drug to take they think that we all should be cured now some people cant take it i am one of them it has hurt me in many ways especially when i have to got to the er with a headache that will not respond to my pain meds they say have you tried imitrex and when i say yes and that it doesnt work for me they look at me like i am nuts i hate when the add for it comes on tv they make it seem as though we are all cured,"headache, migraine, pain, palpitations, short period",1
240,imitrex was little relief i stuck with imitrex for about 4 months after trying numeous other triptans imitrex seemed to be the best but because of the awful taste i dreaded the thought of having to take it i can recall on only 1 ocasion that it helped me out but even in that case its best effort was not as good as midrin was for me there were many other times where i was no better off than if i had taken nothing at all,,0
241,amazing imitrex cluster headaches for me started 10 yrs ago disappeared then back again 2 months ago i have found that imitrex works very well for me with no side effects that i have noticed the pain is stopped 5 minutes after an injection in my belly fat smirk i actually only use about 10 units 5cc30gauge x 516 relyon syringe which is about a fifth of the 5ml vial imitrex comes ingetting about 5 shots per vial i squirt the factory vials into a 2 sterialized vial and fill my syringe from that to me sumatriptan is the wonder drug and i am so very happy that the pain is stopped without using narcotics,pain,1
242,imitrex spells relief imitrex always works on my migraines even the really bad ones yesterday 12102004 is a good example i suffer from frequent 2 attacks per week migraines complete with aura sometimes so bad i am completely incapacitated yesterday i was overtired from not getting adequate sleep the night before which i know is one of my major triggers and sure enough around 4 pm a migraine struck and i immediately took an imitrex and pain meds it turned out to be one of the worst attacks ive ever suffered to the point where i nearly begged my husband to take me to the er instead 2 hours after the first dose of imitrex percocet and gabitril i took another dose of imitrex oxycontin percocet gabitril ultram and klonopin and waited i slowly improved until 1030 pm when i was finally able to tolerate low levels of light and low volume conversation the only possible side effect which could be from either the medication or the migraine itself is the next morning i wake up feeling hung over as far as cost goes this med would be unaffordable to someone without prescription insurance and even with a good insurance plan i had to wait a year before it was placed on the formulary list of preferred name brand drugs,"aura, migraine, pain",1
243,not great for long term use imitrex worked okay for me but the longer i took it the less it seemed to work i felt more side effects with this than any other medication,,0
244,excellent medication for migraineurs i have been using imitrex for many years now and think its the best thing since sliced bread although for me it is not without side effects i still would be lost without it especially at the higher dosages i do feel sometimes feel tired and and on a rare occasion even downright lethargic after taking it but the truth of the matter is i have not had quite the same luck at stopping migraine pain with the other triptans as i have had with imitrex i usually take 50 mgs for most migraines but will take 100 mgs for more severe episodes for migraines that are blinding i will use the injection i have gotten relief in as little as twenty minutes caution like with all triptans it can only be taken if you have stable blood pressure,"migraine, pain",1
245,imitrex i found imitrex to make me feel worse than before i took it it didnt get rid of the migraine made me feel tired and nauseated it does work for some but the cost is really high,migraine,1
246,imitrex this was very effective for many years but eventually started to not work as fast so dr switched to zomig and have used axert as well with good results,,0
247,imitrex to much buck and not enough bang i started taking imitrex a few months ago after talking to my doctor about the frequent headaches that i was getting they would be anywhere from mild to moderate with the occasional severe one the headachesmigraines that i was getting had a constant pain along with poundingpulsing and stabing pains that at times could bring me to my knees imitrex did a fairly good job at stopping the pulsingpounding and stabbing pain along with lessing the nausia and light sensitivity that i had but did nothing for the constant pain not to mention it made me extremely drowsy and in some cases dizzy,"frequent headaches, pain",1
248,imitrex for migraines it always works for me even my worst migraines respond to imitrex,,0
249,imitrex i dont know what id do without it,,0
250,one time shot never again just came back and felt too weird not myself,,0
251,sumatriptan still works imigran is the one triptan that still works for me even after 9 years however it wears off after 1224 hours and it has considerable side effects still it is the only truly relieble migraine abortive for me which is almost utterly realiable,migraine,1
252,imigran imigran is the only one which gives me pain relief in injection form the tablets are not very effective imigran is the best for me,pain,1
253,use it wisely the motherload of cluster relief started with nasal spray until that became ineffective after a few cluster attacks switched to injection works about 95 of the time since i am only allowed 10 doses per month which i could concievably burn through in a week i wait a little longer to see how bad the attack will be before i inject once i do relief within 15 to 20 minutes once in a great while ill need a second dose but thats really rare eyes on the cost 10 vials list at 525 my insurance copay is now 35 and as i said they cap the number i can get cant be used in combo with an ergot medication so if i try a dr sample and it doesnt work im stuck the gold standard in cluster relief,burn,1
254,great migraine starter med used this medicine for the first seven years of my migraines it was truly a wonder drug unfortunately your body can build up a tolerance to the triptans and horrible rebound headaches can pop up with this med definitely worth giving a try if you are just starting to look for a migraine medicine very easy and fast acting also tends to work for an entire day and gets rid of the entire migraine including nausea and other sensitivities without insurance i think it costs a pretty penny though,"migraine, nausea",1
255,satisfied imitrex customer ive been experiencing migraines since the early 80s diagnosed with them in the early 90s and started imitrex statdose almost as soon as it was available i was put on every possible migraine med before that all with terrible sideeffects ive also tried imitrex pills and nasal sprays but they were ineffective i experience on average one migraine a week going as high as 810 migrainesmonth rarely have i had to use more than 1 shot per migraine the imitrex has been that effective for me with relief coming usually within 30 minutes or less i had to rate cost effectiveness as na since i was given imitrex for free while i was active duty military and now i have a copay of only 700 for 4 shots if i had to rate its cost effectiveness it would have to be a 15 on a scale of 110 i would pay anything to stop my migraine pain imitrex has been a godsend for me i dont know what i would do without it my only complaint with the stat dose system is the pain in my leg as the sumatriptan is being injected once the med has been fully injected the pain stops is this normal it doesnt do it all the time but in varying degrees of pain it occurs in about 7580 of my injections am i doing something wrong,"migraine, pain",1
256,imitrexthe wonder drug when i first started taking imitrex it was a miracle drug ive had migraines for at least 10 years and nothing worked for me they are pricy but in my opinion anything that dulls the pain is worth it i get reoccurring side effects from it about 1020 minutes after taking imitrex the left side of my face tingles and goes numb i also end up with a bit of a dazed and exhausted feeling but im not sure if thats a side effect or just part of my migraine all i know is that imitrex usually allows me to return to my normal activities without many problems,"migraine, pain",1
257,imitrex imitrex relieves my headaches usually within 30 minutes i have had no side effects my new dr is worried that i have high bp and shouldnt take it i went off it for 6 weeks and couldnt deal with the pain i am back on imitrex i take about 46 per month its terrific,pain,1
258,imitrex injection it works quickly within about 10 minutes but only lasts about 2 hours and the headache starts to come back,headache,1
259,100 mg works ive always had migraines severe but raremaybe once a year now at 47 ive started having them with every period otc meds were useless fioricet made me wildly restless and put me in a stupor without affecting the headache at all imitrex works wonderfully i need the 100mg tabletthe 50mg just puts the headache off for 12 hours the only side effect is sleepiness the first couple of hourswhat a dramatic relief psthe packaging sucks trying to claw through it with a migraine is awful,"headache, migraine, stupor",1
260,be informed about the cardiovascular risk i had a life threatening episode with imitrex i was in the midst of a severe headache and was not very coherent and vomiting heavily by the time they wheeled me in to the er i was unaware of any preexisting conditions or risk associated with imitrex usually they would give me a shot of meperidinephenergan and let it take affect and send me home however this time due to the reluctance by the doctor on call to dispense narcotics they used imitrex instead the first thing i remember was my face feeling like it was burning then feeling weak and then nothing until i woke up a few hours later in intensive care i had some sort of severe reaction and my heart stopped i had to be resuscitated i later found out and still had a severe headache when i woke up they are still not sure why this happened to me since i have not been diagnosed with any underlying cardiovascular disease or defects so be aware of the risks associated with this class of drugs i use a safer alternative nowadays to control my headaches which does not include a triptan it is a combination of several medications including a strong opioid this cocktail approach has been very effective for me for 5 years now with minimal side effects and is feasible from a financial standpoint i hope this information helps you avoid the nightmare i went through there are effective alternatives to triptans for those who like myself either cannot tolerate them andor find them ineffective god bless,"headache, nightmare, vomiting",1
261,imitrex the cluster migraine killer ive been using imitrex stat dose shots for nearly 8 or 9 years and have found it to be a very powerful drug eliminates a cluster in less than a few minutes takes a bit longer on a migraine but eliminates associated symptoms such as nausea or hortons syndrome in cluster on the negative side there is a large chance of bounceback headache so limit your usage to 3 per week or as prescribed,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
262,no help it did nothing to control my cluster headaches that would attack and settle in to a migraine that would last from 8 hours to 5 days,migraine,1
263,no help it did nothing to control my cluster headaches that would attack and settle in to a migraine that would last from 8 hours to 5 days,migraine,1
264,imitrex used to do the trick i have been taking imitrex for years it has always worked until they changed the formula on me it doesnt really work well for me anymore it doesnt take my migraines away and the side effects are weird now plus the packaging sucks i have no idea what they were thinking urg,,0
265,imitrex injection simply couldnt live without this product i am a 38 year old male living in new york and have been suffering from migraine since i can remember throughout this time i have had to rely on narcotics to control my pain specifically fiorinal wcodeine it was not until a few years ago that a new neurologist helped me realize that a great deal of my problem stemmed from the use of narcotics in the form of rebound headaches since stopping the fiorinal and being placed on beta blockers i have been able to greatly control my migraines i have been using imitrex since it first became approved for use in the us now my occasional headaches are most times totally eliminated with one shot of imitrex i have found less favorable results with both the nasal and tablet form of the product i have gone through a literal hell with this ailment and do not know where i would be if it were not for my present doctor further if it were not for imitrex i would still be relying on narcotics stuck in a neverending cycle of rebound headaches i urge everyone suffering from migraine who have not found relief to reevaluate their usage of narcotics otc rememdies for me finding the right doctor who would not just simply write scripts for painkillers and learning about the condition of rebound headache has allowed me to finally live life,"headache, migraine, pain",1
266,imitrex is great but wears off expensive works but wears off after about 10 hours have to keep taking it for about a week,,0
267,imitrix this was helpful at first but then i built up a tolerance for it,,0
268,works with help does not seem to be very effective by itself but my migraines come on usually after a tension headache an injection of toradol followed by fiorinal and imitrex seems very effective unfortunately it only works for a few hours but the new second generation migraine medications dont seem as effective as the old reliable imitrex if your docs office offers it in an injectable form seems to work better at relieving eyetemple pain,"headache, migraine, pain, tension, tension headache",1
269,imigran injections i took it one year ago on rare occasions when the crisis had become severe enough to make me think ill die and it worked in a few minutes and worked so much better than vioxx that i anyhow vomited at this stage of the crisis se chills need to sleep that i also have after each attack it wasnt very practical to open the injection kit when you can hardly open your eyes ok i understood that migraine medications are really efficacious,"chills, migraine",1
270,imitrex just doesnt do it for me imitrex is highly touted and i had high hopes that it would be the magic bullet to abort my migraines it wasnt but i know that like so many other migraine aborting drugs it works well for some,migraine,1
271,imitrex etc generally i find this medication to be more effective than any other that i have tried i usually combine it with fioricet and try to take it as soon as possible after onset of the headache unfortunately it doesnt always do the trick,headache,1
272,imitrex imitrex saved my life it was the only drug i ever found effective and i have tried them all i take it and within 20 minutes the migraine is gone they used to immobilize my life now i have control thank god for imitrex,migraine,1
273,felt worse i have tried this particular medication twice and on both occasions my migraine progressed and i vomited more plus i felt increasing chest pain like i was having a heart attack this drug is not for me,"chest pain, migraine, pain",1
274,imitrex used sparingly i find imitrex works for my worst of migraines generally within 1 hr i limit my use of it because of the cost only 1 time out of the some 30 odd times i have used it did it not bring me the relief usually i take otc except on the very severe migraines rarely have i needed more than 1 tablet to get rid of the migraine the pain and all the peripheral discomforts such as light noise auras nausea,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
275,imitrex this one i am an expert on i was one of the first people put on this drug i have tried all 3 forms the pill is like a placebothe nasal spray did not work very effectively at all and had the terrible side effect of causing a post nasal drip with a terrible taste that lasted for what seemed like forever and gave me a very nauseous stomachthe injection on the otherhand has been my life saver i have suffered from migraines since i was a little girl but with no diagnosis only knew i would get headaches and then usually throw upwhen i became a mother i knew i needed some type of help so i could be able to function and take care of my daughter couldnt abandon her and go lie in a dark room i have been a guinea pig of sorts for my neurologist over the last 15 years have tried multiple types of drugsthe imitrex injection is the one that actually can bring my migraines under control my migraines are usually 3 days in length i will need 12 injections the first day and then 1 injection the next 2 following daysthey are hormonally related the side effects of the injection are 1 sometimes if the needle hits a small capillary i get a bruise i inject on my thigh2 the headache for me usually gets worseit expands to both sides of my head before it subsides and goes awaythat is a dragknowing when i try to get relief it will hurt more at firstso usually i try to take a couple of tylenol first to dull the pain a bit and then do the injectioni used to take ibuprofen but since having stomach surgery am limited to tylenolit works fine,"headache, pain, surgery",1
276,effectiveness evaluation imitrex i was eager to use imitrex on the heels of what i considered a lot of hype having consulted with a neurologist i was given a telephone book size container containing epipen and instructional video this has got to be great i said to myself in my case the effectiveness of imitrex was sporadic sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt it did give me a terrific muscle ache in the neck whenever i took it that way i knew something was happening let me ask you this do you too feel guilty when something like this doesnt work,ache,1
277,imitrex this drug saved my job i had lost so many days due to migraines i would not have been surprised by my firing the key to imitrex is to take it immediately as soon as you are reasonably sure you have a migraine if you wait the drug is considerably less effective i found the tablets did not work fast enough for me so i would most often need two doses to get rid of the pain the nasal spray is also an option but for my copay the shots are the best they start working in five minutes and you can be pain free in as little as fifteen the shot kit makes it easy for a layperson to give an injection if necessary i can give myself a shot in the ladies room and be back at work in minutes the creator of imitrex deserves a medal no more writhing in bed for three days helpless and in pain what could be better than that,"migraine, pain",1
278,a life saver imitrex has been a life saver for me i had suffered for over fifty years with classic migraines until imitrex nothing on the market helped to ease my pain,pain,1
279,imitrex a stop gap solution i think zomig worked slightly better for me but is much more expensive with my insurance still imitrex isnt cheap either regardless of brands ive discovered that triptans cause headache rebound increased frequency they are best saved for the occassion migrained once or twice a month diet modification is the real key see brand bucholz for a writeup,headache,1
280,best for me after taking many medications for 30 years that did not help the migraines i started on imitrex now within 25 minutes of the injection im rid of the severe pain and can stand the light and noise around me,pain,1
281,there are now better options fellow migraneurs i tried the imitrex nasal spray and vomited just from the taste my doc gave me the brand new zomig nasal spray and to my delight it didnt have that awful taste i love this drug because its effective and works in 15 minutes for me which is way faster than any of the pill triptans on the market they take about a half hour plus its very easy to use 1 spray in 1 nostril and thats it i highly recommend zomig nasal spray over any imitrex product,,0
282,wonderful i started taking imitrex when i first started getting headaches while stationed in ft irwin ca it worked wonders but my doctor doesnt want to give it to me so now i suffer with the migraines my husband has dang near had enough he hates it when i have a migraine,migraine,1
283,imitrex injectionsmigraine headaches i have sufferedcoped with migraine headaches since i was 11 yrs oldi am 53i have been through every test imagineable tried many of the migraine medicines anything drs would suggest nothing worked this drug has changed my life i feel it is god sent for me i hope im never without it cost is high though for as long as it has been on the market at first use years ago i had a little racing of the heart beat but now no sede effectsi have taken it since it came on the market in the us usually one injection is all it takes im giving a big thank you to all that made this drug possible sharon,migraine,1
284,imitrex gives false hope my husband gets migraines and he was on imitrex it worked for a while then all of a sudden it stopped working he tried switching to the nose spray but only used it once the nose spray made him so sick he was in bed for a whole day it has the worst taste and made him want to throw up he switched to maxalt and has been doing great with it,,0
285,its pretty effective but with side effects the main complaint i have about maxalt and imitrex is that they make my skin feel like its on fire overall both are pretty effective even though i occasionally have to take another pill an hour after the first one but that migraine has to be pretty darn bad for me to feel desperate enough to deal with the burning sensation all over my body,"burning sensation, migraine",1
286,imitrex like axert this medication did nothing for my migraines,,0
287,total relief i have found total relief from the excruciating pain of clusterheadaches in the form of imitrex injections although they come in 6mg dose i have learned how to inject myself with 2mg of the 6mg dose to extend this expensive but effective medication the smaller dosage works just as quickly 510 min and effectively as the larger dose imitrex injections have given me my life back the only side effect i experience is a slight burning sensation at the time of injection and some tightness in the chest both are a small price to pay considering the unbeleivable unbearable suicidal like pain from a cluster headache i work partime 30hrs as i am a single dad raising children i have no medical coverage which for me is the only other side effect of taking imitrex injections i pray my fellow suffers find the same relief i have thru imitrex injections,"burning sensation, cluster headache, headache, pain",1
288,imitrix i have used this product since oct 1997 initially it had 90 effectiveness however when the effectiveness drops below 70 i go on a drug holiday for three months then restart the medication to combat drug rebound has my neurologist limits me to a max of 5 injections per week i have tried all three forms and find the injection works best for me,,0
289,stopped using this one sometimes imitrex worked and sometimes not it was covered by my work medical plan so the expense was not a concern for me the worst side effect was chest pressure when the migraine didnt go away and then this huge pressure in my chest made me really uneasy i do not use imitrex any more,"chest pressure, migraine",1
290,cut em up when i started taking them i did not have insurance so i asked dr for the max dose i would then cut them into fourths however since then the pills come in a funky shape imagine that i still cut them up best i can its relative the max does wont hurt me so less is okay no matter how you cut it,,0
291,imitrex cccasionally i have to take 2 tablets about 1 hour apart i take the tablet at the first sign of a headache,headache,1
292,expensive life saver having had migraines for 40 years ive tried every remedy available imitrex injection is the best in that it knocks out the pain and does so quickly and the worst in that it costs way too much even with insurance the only side effect i experience is a sense of heat circulatory system for a few minutes after injection,pain,1
293,side effects were awful i tried imitrex and had very frightening side effects along with my migraine as if i werent in enough pain the imitrex caused me to have crushing chest pain and nausea no more for me,"chest pain, migraine, nausea, pain",1
294,imigran imitrex lifesaver i have used imigran injections since they came on the market here in the uk about 11 years ago i have suffered from migraine since i was a teenager and when my children were little it was very difficult to cope with a horrendous banging head and feeling sick and could be out of action for whole days at a time imigran has been a lifesaver for me and i dont have to cancel something if i have that terrible head anymore i too sometimes get the fluttery feeling in the chest but once i lay down for 20 minutes or so that pain has gone its a miracle,"feeling sick, migraine, pain",1
295,dalene i used imitrex from the very beginning of its coming into existence beginning with the shots i had more side effects from the shots pain coming down my arm and out my fingers the nasal type was awful a bad taste for hours imitrex saved my lifefor i had a severe debilitating headache lasting 45 days with only a day between i was not functioning as a person pain shots pills and the like caused me to be so sick to my stomach a threw up with every movement i was immmediately better the cost was very prohibitive and i would wait till the last moment i soon found it was more costeffective to take one the moment of indication for i needed fewer and i felt all relieved of pain my insurance changed and the cost effectiveness was no longer a factor although because i suffer from about 18 a month my dr has to send in over rides to my insurance to allow me to take more than their authorized number,"bad taste, headache, pain",1
296,rachell hood very costly and worsened my headache,headache,1
297,imitrex 100mg imitrex works most of the time on my daily migraines it loses effectiveness during my menses and i have to use dihydroergotamine injections then,,0
298,first relief i was introduced to imitrex about 10 years ago the first time i used it was in shot form instead of losing a day of my life as usual i was up and feeling great in 20 minutes i have never left the house without two shots and a 50 mg tablet since i have taken them under every circumstance driving working studying if the first tablet doesnt work an injection an hour later always does,,0
299,not perfect i have used all forms of this medication injection nasal spray and tablet i had the most side effects with this triptan i had throat constriction and heart palpitations it only worked about 10 of the time for me unfortunately i no longer use it,palpitations,1
300,imitrex i gave imitrex high ratings but for me there is a rather large catch i have to take it with fiorinal with codeine if i do migraines that used to keep me bedridden for up to 4 days are at least at a tolerable level in under 2 hours often the pain is down to just a normal headache which is a constant in my life the doctor that suggested i combine the two gave me a sense of control over my migraines for the first time in 22 years,"bedridden, headache, pain",1
301,use of imitrex it stops my migraine pretty quickly usually withing 20 minutes but the side effects are almost as bad as the migraine you just have to figure out which one you want to deal with,migraine,1
302,worked then didnt i used this several times the first few with success but then it started making me feel worse like my head was going to explode so the doctor took me off,,0
303,it gave me back my life ive had migraine headaches for most of my life using numerous treatments with little to no relief from most of them or the side effects that resulted were not allowing me to continue to function as a mother and wife this was a miracle began first on the injections which worked wonderfully my doctor tried me on the nasal spray which i hated but it worked and we have settled on the tablets,migraine,1
304,a winner imitrex is ultracostly my doc helps by giving me samples ive also used injectable its ok too but you need to be shown how to selfinject imitrex works effective against migraine only no benefit for tension or mixed headaches part migrainepartsomethingelse no tolerance and no sideeffects even tho ive had a heartattack i have no prob with this,"migraine, tension",1
305,great for migraines this is the only medication that has ever been able to relieve my migraines without the use of powerful narcotics like demerol i have used imitrex for over 10 years and have found nothing better its the best thing on the market thank god for the drug,,0
306,weighted my movements i found it made my arms and legs feel like they had weights on them and i felt like i was thinking slower the headaches were no better with imitrex than fiorinal,,0
307,the miracle injection i have had major migraines for years but only diagnosed as such about a year ago maxalt was effective at first but having daily headaches resulted in a tolerance eventually the imitrex tablets only made my panic attacks worse but the injection wow for me it means absolute relief within 45 minutes even better if you can restnap while it takes effect just be warned about the first chest tightening feeling that occurs after injection nothing will happen to you its just scary if you arent expecting it now i know what to first expect after the injection and the relief that is soon to follow i even have a needle phobia and i still can inject myself because of the nifty little tube the needle hides in i wouldnt want to use the injection everyday or with every headache coming on but for those headaches that make a dark room and social withdrawal the only option this sure works for me good luck to all of you with migraines for so many years no doctor heard my pleas for help and too please remember that it took maxalt and imitrex tablets to fail in order for me to get the injection prescribed its so good to know that i will never pray to die as a result of a migraine again ,"headache, migraine, phobia",1
308,its okay i used other medications for my migraines before my doctor prescribed imitrex but it has seemed to be the most effective thus far,,0
309,only time i ever look forward to a needle i have been using imitrex injection as needed for migraine for many years and it works well and quickly it almost always works with one injection but rarely i have had to inject a second dose later in the day the only side effect ive ever encountered is occasional slight spasms in my throat i have also tried the nasal spray but dont recommend it when it runs down the back of your throat it tastes terrible and now matter how much water you drink you cant wash it away the nasal spray also doesnt always work for me stick with the injection pun intended,migraine,1
310,this stuff works wonders i was diagnosed with migraines a few years back at first i didnt know what they were my vision would get all blurry and then i would get hit with a huge headache now once the blurriness starts i pop an imitrex and bam after a few hours back to new i dont get many but if it werent for imitrex i would never be able to finish a day at work when i get one now i just take one and keep going till the pain goes away,"headache, pain",1
311,yuck imitrex did not work for me it got rid of the debilitating pain but i was still left with all the other symptoms i get migraines 15 x a month so i cant afford to stay at home in bed with each,pain,1
312,dose related problems imitrex previously has not worked for me as well as many many others it has been said by my neurologist that if it didnt work in the past the reason is dose related and the dose must be changed either up or down for it to work try it i still prefer zomig zmt dissolvable tablets they are especially convenient for you when you are at work,,0
313,imitrex inj made my head feel spacey as if my neck wasnt on tight didnt do much for the migraine two friends swear by this stuff however,migraine,1
314,wonderful at first after years of suffering through migraines imitrex was a godsent gift although i chiefly use the tablets the injections were fool proof for me though they made me quite sick for about a half hour then then headache was completely gone unfortunately my insurance company denied the injections so i went to the tablets the tablets usually work the problem has been that recently i have begun to rebound getting the same headache or a rebound about 24 hours later so now im looking at other remedies,headache,1
315,imitrex imitrex works well for me if i rotate imitrex zomig and maxalt my insurance covers most of the cost of all of them i try to take it when i can lie down head elevatedfor 20 or 30 minutes and i can tolerate only 25 mg i get the 50mg tabs for the same price as 25 mg and split them if i have a very bad headache opening the package makes me nuts but its usually worth it,headache,1
316,shoot me up dopeman i have been really struggling with migraines for 2 years i started on 50mg pills and these didnt work the injections were awesome my migraines would last 2 to 3 days before now theyre gone in 10 minutes some people dont like the idea of injecting themselves but there is just some appealing something kinda naughty about shooting up,,0
317,it really works i suffered with migraines for years stayed out of light away from noisewhen i felt one coming on i identified my triggers and have learned to control my environment somewhat making attacks fewer inbetween when i do feel them coming on i try to go to a quiet place and when that doesnt help imitrex does no dizziness no drugged feeling just relief fast even with 4 kids,dizziness,1
318,not for me i was one of the special lucky people that gets the amazing rebound effect from imitirex instead of improving things it much worsened them,rebound effect,1
319,excellent before imitrex came along the only drug i had to depend on was fiorinal with codeine that was a terrible drug to depend on it was hard to get too i started using imitrex shots in 1993 they were a godsend but the injections though fast acting caused me a heavy feeling in my chest i switched over to the pills all i use for migraines are the imitrex 50mg pills i have problems at times with rebound in which case i tough it out for a day i think imitrex is a godsend no side effects other than the one,,0
320,imitrex i have tried all the triptan drugs at one time or the other and all have the same effect they make my chest feel tight i feel quesy and clammy and in general yukky plus i still have the headache that i started with i dont even try to use them anymore,headache,1
321,imitrex worked for me imitrex is a miracle drug for my migraines i couldnt believe how well it helped im over 50 now and no longer have migraines but while i took it i was so grateful for the relief it gave me,,0
322,i had no luck with imitrex i would recommend that anyone try this or a similiar drug to evade migraine pain at least once although it didnt work for me i know many people for whom it works wonders unfortunately the side effects were as bad as the headache for me i suffered palpitations nausea and dizziness although i was on the lowest dose available it also did not touch the pain i would end up in the hospital crying and cradling my head,"crying, dizziness, headache, migraine, nausea, pain, palpitations",1
323,imitrix taken for right sided migraines works great,,0
324,dont be discouraged dont let any negative reviews of imitrex discourage you from at least trying it once as recommended i took my first shot under the supervision of a physician i didnt die and my headache went away i have been using the injection form for about three years now it does make you feel like your whole body is on fire and gives you a tight chest but anything is better than the headache this stuff is expensive so if it isnt covered by your insurance dont try it or else you will probably go bankrupt buying the stuff,headache,1
325,wouldnt leave my house without it imitrex is a terrific drug to combat migraine headaches i may get a little sleepy after taking it but really i have not experienced many side effects the only problem that i have encountered is that when i have an excessively hostile migraine it works only a little my doctor however gave a drug related to imitrex called amerge this medication is even better than imitrex i carry it in my purse and run and get a refill on prescription when i see i am getting low,migraine,1
326,works pretty well i have been using this for five years and it works fairly well sometimes i do not respond to imitrex or have to take a few doses in one night in general i like it and it works well the side effects stink numb feeling in the muscles but worth it to get rid of the pain,pain,1
327,imitrex ive gone from 80 in the beginning to 60 65 lately in stopping the migraines on the first dosage still its better than anything else ive tried and ive tried everything,,0
328,imitrex nasal spray it takes practice to use spray correctly found that it was hardly effective in relieving my migraines made sideeffects especially nausea much worse,nausea,1
329,works like a charm imitrex is amazing its expensive so i only take it when i have somewhere to go or something to do and cant afford to be incapacitated and it works every time the shot works faster but its insanely expensive if you dont have insurance i find that i seem to get more migraines when i use medication to stop them as if they keep coming until i just go ahead and suffer through one but with imitrex at least the choice of when to do this is mine,,0
330,imitrex is a godsend imitrex is an absolute godsend i wish it came out when i was youngeri have had headaches all of my life and this medication is totally effective on the headaches that would keep me in bed for days at a time i not only use the tablets but the injections as well injections are particularly useful when nausea that generally accompanies migraines is out of control,nausea,1
331,imitrex 25mg when i get migraine headaches it is hard for me to function i have used imitrex and it has always helped me tremendously the cost is worth the money if you can afford it there have been times that i have had to borrow money in order to buy the imitrex to help my migraine but it was worth the money,migraine,1
332,imitrex i had tried the pill the nasal spray and the injection i am sorry to say i had nothing but problems with it it made me extremely sick the nasal spray gave me an awful sinuslike headache on top of the migraine headache nausea the first time i tried them they worked after that no luck,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
333,terrible medication for complex migraines i was diagnosed with complex migraines about 9 years ago my first neurologist prescribed imitrex my migraines consist of numbness on one side of body auras inability to speak correctly inability to think logically vomiting my very first episode like this i took imitrex and it did nothing no matter how often i took it i was alone and it lasted for 8 hours with jarbbled speech excruciating pain vomiting i could not get myself to the er or call for an ambulance because for one i couldnt talk i could figure out how to work a phone i couldnt put my shoes on becasue i couldnt think of what a shoe was i grabbed my remote control thinking it was my purse i did manage to get my keys but when i got to my car i couldnt figure out how to unlock the door thank goodness because i may not be writing this if i got into my car in my condition i kept taking my pills but nothing happened it was extremely scarey and my new neurologist said to stay away from any type of imitrex products so now after taking midrin and darvacet i am now going to sample maxalt zomig and axert to see which of those will help,"numbness, pain, vomiting",1
334,imitrex almost immediately after taking the pill my back and chest tightened and left me with shortness of breath it did nothing for my migraine but left me in tears from the side effects i would not recommend this to anyone,migraine,1
335,imitrex did nothing for migraine,migraine,1
336,imitrex imitrex worked very well for me for about 18 months then it lost its efficacy completely,,0
337,imitrex i have tried the 25 mg 50 mg and 100 mg pills taken orally and the 6mg injectible i prefer the injectible it works fast fast fast and each and every time i have used it the pills on the other hand can take from 45 minutes to 25 hours to kick in and get rid of the migraine if they even do that on the first dosage taken another annoying thing about the pills is that they come in those foil wrappings which are so fun to mess with while having a migraine i just wish my insurance carrier allowed for more than 4 injections per month,migraine,1
338,didnt work i tried imitrex once and it had relatively no effect on my migraine i followed up with the second dose as prescribed by my doctor and still no help im going to stick with vicodin 750mg,migraine,1
339,imitrex only medication i have found to relieve a full blown migraine headache only side effect is drowziness and that is sometimes severe can get by with one dose but two are sometimes needed second one an hour after the first,"headache, migraine",1
340,imitrex imitrex when i first took it was a gift from god i had relatively few side effects a little tightness in my chest and if i took it when i first suspected i was getting a headache i wouldnt get one now that they are limiting the amount you can take in a month and upped the copay on my insurance i sometimes wait to see if i really am getting a migraine then i tend to have to take it for the length of the headache instead of stopping it in its tracks not so good but i no longer have to lie down for hours in a dark quiet room to escape or overdose on fiorinal in order to function yippee,"headache, migraine, overdose",1
341,great for stopping cluster headaches i have been using the imitrex injection for several years to stop episodic cluster headaches when they occur this medicine is great it will stop the headache almost completely in about 1015 minutes and it has never not worked for me even when i have taken it more than 2 times in 24 hours for different headaches i have experienced some of the sideeffects theyre very shortlived and not uncomfortable i would recommend being able to lie down and rest after using it as it can make you dizzytired my biggest complaint its price is 50 an injection if it werent so expensive and could be used more frequently than 2x a day a situation a cluster headache sufferer can encounter needing it would be even better i am very pleased with the imitrex injection for its effectiveness in stopping cluster headaches quickly and think it is definitely worth a try despite its high price,"cluster headache, headache",1
342,imitrex injection helps me i have had migraines for years i have tried several different things such as amerge imitrex nasal spray and tablets the only thing that helps is the imitrex injection it completely takes the pain away within 20 minutes the worst part for me is the initial side effect which includes severe head throbbing 10 times worse than the actual migraine it does go away after about 5 or 10 minutes and it is definitely worth it especially since its the only thing that will take the pain away completely my only complaint is the cost,"migraine, pain",1
343,awesome migraine drug imitrex has changed my life i have suffered severe migraines since the age of 5 i am 35 now i know longer lie on the bathroom floor heaving from throwing up so much i used to stay in bed for 3 days until this horrible pain would cease imitrex cures my headache within one hour i normally use the injections but the 100mg pills get rid of it at the onset the only side effects i have are heaviness in my chest and throat for about 30 minutes,"headache, migraine, pain",1
344,imitrex nasal spray for me its the fastest acting imitrex with the least side effects the pill doesnt work well for me and the injection takes longer to work and has many more and worse side effects however it doesnt always take my headache away though it always decreases it often the headache will come back later the same day or the next morning,headache,1
345,give me the shot i started having migraines at the age of 10 40 yrs ago and i think imitrex is a miracle and i have found that the imitrex injections always work for me regardless of whether i use it at the onset of the migraine or during ive tried the imitrex pills up to 300 mg per serious event and just havent found them to be as effective as the injections i do experience more neck and jaw tightness with the injections but that passes within 10 minutes and then the heachache is also gone soill take the shots even though i hate needles and its much more cost effective than ending up in the emergency room for a shot of demerol and phenergran,migraine,1
346,100mg tablet dont forget about the 100mg form ask your doc i recommend my doc moved me from 50mg to 100mg and my life has changed it may be expensive ask for samples and a prescription,,0
347,works for me when you have a migraine needle behind the eyeballhead about to pop etc go with what works imitrex takes longer to work than it should about 1hr but wham it works migraine gone only side effect is youre wiped after the headache is gone but that probably isnt the fault of imitrex,"headache, migraine",1
348,imitrex worked for me this was the first time i had used this product it took about 2 hours but my headache was completely gone by that time i dont think i had any side effects at all,headache,1
349,imitrex is the best i have been using fiorinal for years for tension headaches fiorinal does not work on full blown migraines imitrex was a godsend for me i take the injections one injection during a full blown migraine and its completely gone within 10 minutes show me any other medication out there that can do that for a full blown migraine,"migraine, tension",1
350,imitrex i used imitrex for a couple of years and it seemed to work well at first but then it just suddendly stopped working i also had to take it immediately when i got the aura or it wouldnt work at all i had increased nausea and giving myself the injection was difficult,"aura, nausea",1
351,it works for me imitrex works every time for me i only take it when i feel a migraine coming on i do get a detached spacey feeling after taking it but its not an unpleasant experience,migraine,1
352,imitrex thank goodness for imitrex injections i just started these a few months ago and the injections are all that work for me the pills didnt do it for me i tried everything under the sun even the inhaler but it didnt work for me the injection usually takes the headache away within 10 minutes for me i am so gald to have these the only thing for me is that the medicine hurts a tad going in but its worth it peace joy,headache,1
353,didnt work i tried imitrex and found it didnt even touch my migraines it had worked so well for my dad in the past i assumed it would for myself as well not so i cant really speak about any side effects as i didnt use it long enough i couldnt tell i had taken anythingthe pain was still too bad,pain,1
354,imitrex saved me imitrex injection has changed my life im a severe case since age 10 started using this as soon as it was legal here 10 yrs and it is the only thing that has ever worked in 20 mins i am free of pain regardless of intensity although during that 20 mins there is strong tingling sleepiness and malaise but who cares i use around 12 shots per month tablets do not work at all for me,"malaise, pain",1
355,imitrex tablets my standard treatment for migraine nearly always gets rid of the migraine with very few side effects often get rebound after 1218 hours but migraine is then less severe and a further imitrex tablet will often eliminate it,migraine,1
356,imitrex the imitrex caused my blood pressure to go really high on occasion the medicine also dried me out considerably and made me terribly hungery,,0
357,sumitriptan pills after long term use often needs to be supplemented with other pain meds sometimes rx overall though i dont know what id do without it oddly seems to work best for me if i take it when the headache is really bad as opposed to at the onset as suggested but i often have different reactions to drugs than expected,"headache, pain",1
358,not for me anymore ive tried all three forms of this and ive finally decided its just not worth it its only worked once in the past year and it comes with such horrible side effects fluttering in the chest intense tightening of the back neck muscles etc a hot washcloth over the eyes in a blackedout room works better than this expensive stuff,,0
359,doesnt work i used this product for several years with no success the product does not provide any relief and is very expensive ive tried both the tablets and nasal spray ive had better success with hot packs on my head ice packs on my neck and a dark room im now using frova and it seems to be working great,,0
360,migraines i was actually on the first trial study for this i must say this does not work for me and i would also experiance shooting pains within my head post taking this,,0
361,imitrex injections are the easiest of the triptans imitrex injections are the easiest of the triptans for me to administer when i have a fullblown migraine with nausea since i dont need to swallow a pill the disolving tablets dont work for me since nutrasweet is one of my triggers so if you dont mind injecting yourself the kit makes it really easy this form of imitrex is fast and easy i have to admit i havent tried the nasal spray yet still imitrex doesnt last as long as zomig and you are allowed only one shot in 24 hours so when it wears off you have to take something else or suffer,"migraine, nausea",1
362,long term use nothing has worked long term for my migraines im still waiting i guess for that one treatment to come out that will work every time,,0
363,ineffective after years of taking imitrex it has become ineffective,,0
364,imetrex could not survive without this ive been using imetrex injections for 10 years for hormonal migraines it is the only drug that ever worked for me side effects vary depending on the time of day if i shoot up in the morning i feel dopey and tired for about an hour and then thats gone the later in the day it gets the longer the side effects last what is scary is that this drug constricts every blood vessel in your body the older i get the more i am concerned about possible heart attack theres got to be a better way for my type of migraines hormone therapy makes them worse i pay 2500 per 2 shot kit my insurance picks up the rest,,0
365,hit or miss i have terrible migraine headaches and so far imitrex has been somewhat effective one time other times not at all effective i would say the effectiveness is surpassed by many boiling hot washcloths on the forehead a completely dark room an ice pack on the neck and deep relaxation it didnt stop the vomiting this isnt to say it may not work for some people however i dont think it works for me one side effect is that my breathing becomes quite shallow im not sure if im becoming sleepy or not,"migraine, vomiting",1
366,imitrex injectable ive tried imitrex in all three forms tablets nasal spray and injectable only the injectable works immediately within 10 minutes and without rebound very expensive if you dont have insurance to cover purchase which is shortsighted public policy given the cost to economies all over the world of lost productivity due to migraines also not everyone can tolerate imitrex so i feel very fortunate that i can and that it works beautifully every time i would strongly suggest that if youve never used the injectable you get the first shot at your physicians office or some other setting where youll be monitored by a health care provider,,0
367,imitrex ive used imitrex tablets for several years and its never failed me i can take one and lie down and rest for an hour or two and then my headache is either gone or almost gone after i take it i usually feel sort of sick the rest of the day but its much better than having a migraine i used the nasal spray once and it didnt work for me ive never tried the injection,"headache, migraine",1
368,imitrex imitrex is the only medication i have tried for migrains that is prescription it works well for me i use the nasal spray at the first sign of a headache it relieves the pain it does make me very sleepy though so i wouldnt take it then try to drive,"headache, pain",1
369,imitrex injections i give myself imitrex injections for migraines if caught early enough the shot does the trick and the migraine is gone the only catch is that you have to take the shot as soon as syptoms appear and for about 30 minutes after taking the shot i feel like im having a heart attack it sounds awful but it beats a 35 day migraine,migraine,1
370,i found imitrex works well if i take it the second i feel any of the migraine symptoms if i wait even 20 minutes past that itll usually make the headache worse i suffer migraines with auras and cluster headaches like most everyone there is no way to function once a headache starts mine starts when the barometric pressure raises or lowers with cold fronts hurricanes any weather condition that changes the barometric pressure the pain is rough but the confusion and not able to function for sometimes days on end is the worst only advice i could give anyone with this drug is if you know your body well enough to know a migraine or cluster headache is starting take it immediately dont wait that is the only way it works for me when it does work it is amazing a wonderful tool to the arsenal to fight these crippling headaches iif someone has never had a migraine they truly will never understand the pain were going through,"cluster headache, headache, migraine, pain",1
371,ive never had really migraines until about 9 months ago i had a coworker who suffered with migraines and she introduced these to me when i had a horrible headache she took the 100 mg and when she gave me one to take it knocked me out into the next week i usually have horrible period migraines and ones that ill get on occasion this is the only thing that works for me except i take the 50 mg there has been a couple of times they didnt work but that is minimal to the times it did work i recommend to anyone who suffers with these because i dont know howd function without them,headache,1
372,ive gone to the emergency room with migraines many times because i was so illwhen i tried imitrex it was a lifesaver ive only had a couple of migraines that didnt respond to it the only occasional side effects ive had with it are severe body aches still better than a migraine and vomiting i probably get the body aches once out of every 30 times that i take the imitrex so if i have to go to bed once out of every 30 times for a migraine versus every single time ill take it i suffered debilitating migraines for years with little to no relief please stick to your experience and not your opinion when reviewing a drug your experience is yours and its very short sighted to make a general statement that it should be taken off the market or that people shouldnt take it when its been such a positive experience in my life and many others i missed out on a lot of things with my daughters because of migraines before imitrex it works wonders for millions,"migraine, vomiting",1
373,worst experience of my life started feeling jaw pain shoulder pain nausea heart racing and the worst was tinglynumbing sensation in my arms and legs i felt like i was going to die did not help my migraine at all this should be taken off the market,"heart racing, migraine, nausea, pain, shoulder pain",1
374,i couldnt live without this little pill imitrexsumatriptan is a miracle drug afaik as far as i know it knocks out my crippling fullbody migraines every time so many women and some men dont even know it exists which is a cruel twist of fate it should be available otc without a prescription imho,,0
375,sumatriptan is a very dangerous drug prescribed 100mg when required for migraines i took one and immediately i began to pour sweat muscle in my neck and upper shoulders ached so bad it felt like i was withdrawing from a powerful opiate complete panic attack as well i almost went to the er but stayed home and agonized thru it for 5 hours until the effects were bearable scariest drug ive ever taken please use extreme caution i hope no one ever goes thru what i did,panic attack,1
376,do not take this medication good number of patients with severe headaches may need special type of mri to detect possible aneurysm if patient has aneurysm and take imitrex then they are at high risk of causing rupture in aneurysm i had stroke and undiagnosed aneurysm was diagnosed at the time of stroke on the date of stroke i had severe headaches and i according to the doctor if i had ended up taking imitrex i would not have survived because of aneurysm the risk factors are not disclosed precisely by manufacturers please stay away from that medication and take special mri to rule out aneurysm,aneurysm,1
377,okay so ive been suffering from horrible migraines daily so bad that im stuck in bed in horrible pain im nauseous depressed i have no appetite after being prescribed the imitrex i took it as soon as i felt the migraine come on about 30 minutes in i started to feel my neck and throat feeling tight and my whole head have this burning sensation i started to panic a little then an hour passed and im full blown in pain all over my body im talking aching so bad it felt like i had the worst flu in history but my migraine was gone yes it took care of my migraine but were the body aches that lasted almost the whole day worth it i dont think so ,"burning sensation, migraine, pain",1
378,i took imitrex for many years to knock out migraine headaches however after taking for 15 years i was getting rebound headaches i was warned about this by the pharmacist and doctors but dismissed their concerns because nothing else worked i realized other pain relievers could never touch any headache pain the only way to take away headache pain was with imitrex migraine or not i struggled with tingling in my limbs and extreme sensitivity i finally had a wake up call when i passed out ended up in the er not related to imitrex i dont think and finally went to a chiropractor who helped me get the inflammation out of my neck and shoulders through needling i have not had a migraine headache or a headache that a pain reliever wouldnt work on for a year and a half i am no longer captive to imitrex and its side effects i believe once on imitrex long term rebound headaches will occur i am so glad i am free from the bondage,"headache, inflammation, migraine, pain",1
379,i wanted to share a positive experience here ive been a migraine sufferer since 17 and i am now 24 i am one of the lucky ones who found imitrex to work first try back then and continues to take it to this day this drug is a miracle for me i admit that i have had to bump my doses from 50mg to 100mg but it still works the same i am also lucky that i only need it once a month around the start of my period however when i was younger i used to need them 5 times a month or so anyway i just take one and in about 4560 minutes the pain and nausea start to get better it usually takes 90 minutes for them to be fully gone i do sometimes get a feeling similar to whiplash stiff neck and shoulders and sore scalp but the side effects are far better than a migraine my migraines stay away and i never have to take another pill until the next month im very thankful for this medicine,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
380,i come from a family where everyone has terrible migraines when i started getting them at age 21 i resorted to taking loads of tylenol with pesudophedrine to mask the pain which took a heavy toll on my liver someone suggested that i look into the triptan family of migraine medication after going through a few different ones i found imitrex to be an absolute lifesaver whenever i feel one coming i take 50mg and the migraine usually disappears within 30 minutes if i wait a few hours to take it the response time could be more like 90 minutes with 1015 migraines a month imitrex is essentially the only thing that allows me to function i have not seen any real side effects,"migraine, pain",1
381,ive been experiencing migraines for about 3 years now the pain is always on one side of my head and is completely debilitating i used to have to take a bunch of ibuprofen and sleep in a cool dark room until it went away which took forever finally i was introduced to this medicine i took it a few hours into my migraine and the pain was gone within 15 minutes the medicine made me feel a little weird like my senses were overly receptive and my skin was a bit tingly these temporary symptoms are nothing compared to the migraine ive learned to like these odd side effects because thats how i know my migraine is leaving this is a miracle drug and over the past year ive been taking it its never failed to relieve the pain,"migraine, pain",1
382,used to take these sumatriptan every time i had a migraine and aura 100mg and everything was fine a few days ago i felt symptoms coming on and took one worst experience of my life severe nausea diarrhoea worsening of headache chest pains numb pain in left arm muscle clenching involuntarily jaw pain severe anxiety ended up in er crying and feeling like i was high on drugs days later i do not feel myself i feel anxious panicky and down in my mood please be careful these drugs are not safe for everyone despite me having taken them many times before i will not ever take one again,"anxiety, aura, crying, diarrhoea, headache, migraine, nausea, pain",1
383,my husband has always whats called prostrating attacks which is a form of a migraine that leaves him in so much pain he cant function at all the only medication that has ever worked on him is the imitrex this stuff is awesome the only thing that is irritating is every time i get his prescription filled the pharmacist try to give him the sumatriptan the generic version which makes him so sick he will throw up nonstop for hours so i always have to tell them he needs the name brand and i have gotten into many arguments with pharmacists trying to tell me its the same thing its not when my husband takes imitrex his migraine is gone within minutes he takes a sumatriptan and i feel like i need to take him to a hospital,"migraine, pain",1
384,i have had migraines since i was a kid diagnosed as sinus for many years until one dr asked me to try imitrex it was like a miracle i thought i would have to suffer with 3 to 4 day long headaches that feel like a knife in my temple the rest of my life but imitrex knocks it out in 3040 min there are side effects muscle aches tiredness sensitive skin and the need to pee constantly annoying but of youve had migraines for years it is a good trade off i take a naproxen at the same time to help with body aches,,0
385,i suffered for years with migraines until i saw a specialist he prescribed me 100mg dosage i get almost instant relief i do get a stiff neck sometimes but it only lasts about 15 minutes and my migraine is completely gone i cant live without this medication,migraine,1
386,it makes me crazy when i read that somebody waits until their headache is off the charts to take imitrex i have been suffering for over 25 years with migraines and then imitrex came on the scene that was the end of the migraines the symptoms always began behind my right eyeball and i was able to tell thats a headache was coming and thats when i took the imitrex immediately when i started feeling symptoms not waiting until my headache is fullblown which seems sensible to me it is better to knock it on the head when it isnt to back so you dont have to endure it to long,headache,1
387,i havent had migraines in yearsabout 19 years now every once in awhile maybe twice a year i get an aura i take the sumatriptan and i swear within 10 to 15 minutes the aura is gone no migraine to follow i am so appreciative of this drug i would like to thank the manufacturers of it i wish that all drugs worked as well thank you,"aura, migraine",1
388,i get very bad migraines that make me stay in bed for hours i was prescribed sumitriptan and i took it to see if it worked it did not really relieve my migraine and it made me feel nauseous and super weak i got chest pain and my arms felt very heavy,"chest pain, migraine, pain",1
389,after suffering from constant pounding headaches for the last two weeks this medication was a god send i was finally diagnosed with migraines after years of headaches i had heard some worrying things about the associated side effects but the worst it got for me was worsening of neck and shoulder pain which was there anyway the headache was relieved in an hour best i have felt in two weeks woken up today headache free and neck is fine for all you out there struggling its worth a try dont scare yourself with potential side effects lets be honest you can get side effects from taking simple pain killers,"headache, pain, shoulder pain",1
390,i have been suffering from migraines for about 20 years at first otc painkillers like excedrin migraine would do the trick but about 10 years ago nothing seemed to reduce the pain in the least bit i get about 3 migraines per month that last about 3 days my doctor prescribed propranolol which i take twice a day and it has reduced the frequency of my attacks i take a 50mg sumatriptan at the first signs of a migraine and within an hour it completely goes away thankfully i dont suffer any bad side effects ill feel a little foggy for a few hours but thats about it i literally cannot live without it it has saved my life,"migraine, pain",1
391,i am medication sensitive and was scared to take sumatriptan based on reviews it was totally fine minimal side effects just fatiguebut who wants to stay awake during a migraine i get a great sleep sometimes i have a bit of a migrainemedication hangover and am groggy its still much better than curling up in a dark room in bed crying with an ice pack on your head wondering if youre having a stroke or if its just a migraine take it early when you first notice symptoms sometimes i take it with tylanol so glad i found this,"crying, hangover, migraine",1
392,i get monthly hormonal migraines during my period and sometimes one in the middle of the cycle they are really really bad before sumatriptan i had to stay in bed all day snacking on tylenol like candy without much effect sumatriptan does work the key is to take it as early as possible just when you feel the first tingles of pain take it usually in 3040 minutes i am pain free it does come with pretty nasty side effects for me its extreme weakness very heavy feeling arms and legs low blood pressure and general feel of being unwell so even after taking it i have to take it easy just stay comfortable watch a movie read a book and stay in bed i usually feel so weak i can barely walk but it sure as anything beats being in such a severe pain that you consider calling an ambulance,"pain, unwell",1
393,take as directed when i feel the migraine coming on and sometimes there is no change at all other times like today within 10 minutes my heart is pounding my left jaw and nose and scalp are on fire and my migraine has advanced to dizzying pain i have no idea what is going on but i will be going back to tylenol until i get back to the doctors office,"migraine, pain",1
394,i have been on imitrex for a few years now i dont get migraines too often luckily but theyre horrible when i do i always try to hold off on taking imitrex for as long as i can before i cave which is probably not the best course of action it does work after approx 12 hrs but until the effect does work i get weird uncomfortable side effects my throat gets tight and its difficult to swallow any other muscle ache i have gets amplified my armslegs feel incredibly heavy and overall i just feel like i am floating in my own skin if that even makes sense oh and i have to pee every 15 mins ,ache,1
395,ive always suffered with migraine since i was a child now they are usually selfinduced i dont eat right or if i go out drinking theres no sense in taking any kind of overthecounter pain medication or even strong pain medication i just throw it up the only thing it did relieve any pain was hot water i was introduced to imitrex a yearandahalf ago unbelievable when i have them with me i feel safe does it matter if i take them as soon as i feel symptoms or after the headache is gotten to me it takes it right away i take mine with one bayer aspirin and a sudafed 20 minutes im asleep wake up about 45 minutes later i feel great i think theyre golden,"headache, migraine, pain",1
396,this medication has improved my life so so much now i dont have to skip work for a 2 day migraine as an example of how well sumatriptan works for me last night i had a bad headache light migraine coming on while i was out drinking i took one 25 mg pill and within 45 minutes i started feeling the headache dissipate significantly by an hour the pain was gone completely even though i was still out anyway i highly recommend trying this med even at a low dose personally i dont experience any side effects dont feel weird or sleepy just feel soo much better for someone who used to just suffer from multiple migraines a month and almost overdosed on advil due to the pain and the advil not helping sufficiently i highly recommend this med,"headache, migraine, pain",1
397,imitrex in any form is the best med for cluster headaches by far high flow oxygen at first twinge and the pill at the onset even if you think it might hurt most effective you all know how fast they come on usually work immediately unless late in a cycle i too wish you could take more than twice in a 24 hr period after suffering for almost 20 yrs with no medicine at all for these crippling things i have tried all imitrex types injections pills nasal sprays injections are fast but so very expensive and painful as well nasal spray is nauseating for me the pill form has always worked well if taken at the very blink of headache because of price and insurance restrictions i would wait to take the medicine not anymore,headache,1
398,i have suffered migraines and headaches since i was little iam 55 years old and in physical healthy shape i as many i have been a prisoner in my own body iam totally debilitated for what use to be 12 hours at a time has grown to sometimes days i have suffered hearing loss ringing in my ears with the fullness and so many other symptoms from sinus pressure to neck pain etc i have at 2 different times had epidural shots in my neck for migraines and tried all kinds of pain killers and daily meds to lower the severity and frequency they occur last month alone i had 18 headaches which 13 were migraines ugh the dr put me on imitrex 100 to try i was nervous but it is a miracle drug for me,"neck pain, pain",1
399,ive had cluster headaches for about 10 years brutal soul crushing headaches maybe 100 to 200 times more painful than a common tension headache read about sumatran and asked my doctor he prescribed it about 2 years ago its been a miracle for me completely gets rid of the headache within 15 to 20 minutes no side effects of any kind to those who have experienced side effects i might suggest taking a half or even a quarter dose i was prescribed 20 mg and i usually cut them in half and 10 mg works great for me if 10 mg is an effective dose at least for some people as i can attest then i can only imagine what taking 10 times the dose for your body or system might do as im reading some people here were prescribed 50 or even 100 mg hope this helps,"headache, tension, tension headache",1
400,i am a long time sufferer of frequent chronic migraines up to 15 a month i have used sumatriptan since it became available both in pill form and selfinjection yesterday i tried the new patch zecuity for the first time and likely the last the actual cost per patch is about 30000 the packaging is ridiculous a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about 15 pounds it contained a large thick styrofoam container six special red puretemp bricks designed to keep the drug at room temperature it must be kept between 68 it 77 degrees fahrenheitnot refrigerated and a box of four patches the patches themselves contain the medication but also the releasedelivery system which includes a computer chip the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery four hoursthen the light turns off and patch can be removed and two lithiummanganese dioxide batteries perchlorate material which are considered toxic waste by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly and legally dispose of the used patches the above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it but as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like youd try practically anything so hey even though this is the same drug maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for personally sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never relieved them it may for some but not for me other than the powerful narcotics i take for other chronic pain its the only other thing that helps at all of course there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons so i can only use it for my worst migraines the limit on the patches no more than four per month so okay i decide to give them a try i followed all of the somewhat detailed and involved instructions and activate it apply it and push the start button and the little red light comes on within a few minutes i start to feel a tingling itchy burning sensation though not too bad and certainly not unbearable or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine within about five minutes the gel i assume the medication starts to ooze out the sides of the patch making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off okay the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape so i use medical tape all around the entire patch i use medical tape five minutes later even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel so i apply even more tape a lot of tape i am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body i also only feel very slightly any effect of the sumatriptan i felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on as well as red irritated itchy rashy skin upon removal oh yeah and now what the heck do i do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste are most users really going to properly dispose of these things as far a headache relief obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible another consideration my health insurance required prior approval to cover the patches part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan pill selfinjection intranasal spray were inadequate and that i required the patches when i found that out i refused and told my doctor to do the same i had little faith that a 4hour patch of the same drug would work better than a 5 second injection and i did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections the drug company provided the one month free trial four patches so i agreed to try them several years ago i remember how happy i was when imetrix finally went generic and i was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper it saved me and my insurance company a lot of money i dont really want to give that up either so i suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the selfinjections for me however considering all of the factors above i think ill stick with the injectable pun intended and sometimes the pills as i dont like to carry the autoinjections around in my purse i already have to carry an epipen with me i wish the best to other migraine sufferers perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek for me however they are not the answer,"burning sensation, chronic pain, fall, headache, migraine, pain",1
401,first month prescription for 20 50mg tablets if i take at the first sign of headache goes away about 30 min if wait to take tablet takes up two hours for the pain to stop since i have daily migraines tried waiting to save tablets concerned run out of 50mg tablets prior to refill date the imitrex has been god sent for me i have had migraines since my teens now in my sixities migranies only health probem i have plan to call my doctor let know how well imitrex works for me and see if 30 day prescription or stronger prescription is what i need from other reviews appears some users go days between headaches that would be more than i ever expected after all these years,"headache, pain",1

403,i have suffered from migraines all my life and i am now 57 i was prescribed imitrex at age 39 and the first dose of 50mg gave me a tightness in my throat but it stopped the migraine i suffered with them every day i finally figured out that msg in food was the biggest cause of the migraine msg is disguised by many names but i have eliminated a lot of food and with the help of imitrex i can live an almost normal life without a migraine imitrex sometimes makes me sleep a lot and other times i sleep for about 30 minutes and im fine i praise the makers of imitrex because nothing else would completely take the pain away,"migraine, pain",1
404,i got my first migraine when i was 6 i suffered so badly when i got one which was often dizziness vomiting and aura nothing helped they tried everything as i got older i learned to take advil right an the onset of symptoms and that usually helped a little after my daughter was born the migraines returned with a vengeance i finally couldnt take the pain any longer and sought out a neurologist he prescribed sumatriptan 100mg and it has literally changed my life i take it and rest for about a hour with my eyes closed and it goes away every time sometimes if its bad i also use a ice pack i would recommend this to any migraine sufferer if you have migraines and wont take this medication because of side effects i can tell you i had none its a miracle drug,"aura, dizziness, migraine, pain, vomiting",1
405,i completely rely on imitrex once i had this the daylong headaches are gone i now know that what i used to call sinus headaches were migraines i had since a teenager though not bad until into my 40s my side effects are a little sleepiness and maybe some tiredness but nothing compared to the debilitation of a migraine however i am much more aggressive with eliminating triggers particularly msg and processed foods and this helps my better diet has reduced my need for imitrex down to 23 times a month,migraine,1
406,i only use this when i am incapacitated from migraine pain i get it behind my left eye and cant open it have a hard time walkingtalking and end up vomiting it relieves the physical pain and i am able to see walk and talk but i am still pretty much down for the count it says you can take it every 2 hours but man 1 dose and i feel it for the rest of the day i get very drowsy my eyes get droopy and it feels like im walking underwateror through thick honey everything feels so heavy my speech is slower i get waves of nausea once i take it im home for the day no way would i feel comfortable driving the side effects can be tough for sure but i will take them over the bad migraine pain any day i am always thankful i took it even if i have to be confined to the couch for 46 hours,"migraine, nausea, pain, vomiting",1
407,this medication will take a migraine away in 20 minutes if you have work that day or are trying to get to sleep this in invaluable to me once or twice a month it stops the pounding quickly especially accompanying a hot bath,migraine,1
408,migraines have become my worst enemy over the past 45 years thank goodness for imitrex i started with the pills then the nasal spray and have worked my way up to the shots plus nausea medicines the pills had the least side effects the spray was vile tasting but fast acting and i could take it while working when my headaches worsened they added botox and upgraded me to the injected version i needed something that acted fast so i could stay in the classroom the down side to the injection is the head rush change of hear rate and the flushing feeling when i inject i have about 1530 bad minutes then i kind of restabilize and about an hour later i usually feel better and capable of continuing to teach,"flushing, nausea",1
409,i almost always get migraines around my period or times of extreme stress i was getting a migraine that began as nausea hot flashes dizziness and weakness the entire day that night the pain started so i took 25 mg imitrex in 90 min the pain was gone i felt some pressure where the pain had been and couldnt lay on that side a week later i feel another migraine come on and i wasnt sure it was a migraine until the nausea came took imitrex again and the pain went away after 2 hours but then i got super drowsy and fell asleep and woke up an hour later shaky and anxious i had not had a good nights sleep the day before so those symptoms may be attributed to lack of sleep but they went away after a few hours i did try imitrex in the middle of a migraine with nausea blurry vision severe pain and it didnt help i was discouraged and did not take a second dose that time i suggest taking imitrex as soon as you feel pain,"dizziness, migraine, nausea, pain, stress",1

412,words cannot express how grateful i am for this medicine i have dealt with these crippling headaches since my mid 20s now in my mid30s i finally happened upon a physician at a carenow of all places who actually listened to me as i told him of the nightmare i face at least three times a day every day for months on end and prescribed imitrex for me if taken at the very first sign of an attack these little beauties i take the oral can save you 30 minutes to several hours of unimaginable pain i cannot recommend enough that my fellow cluster headache sufferers ask their doctor about considering imitrex while theres no cure this is the closest thing ive found so far that at least makes living with these headaches bearable,"cluster headache, headache, nightmare, pain",1
413,imitrex did not work for me i have not reached the vomiting stage of a migraine in years thanks to other medications imitrex did nothing to stop the progression of my migraine i had to leave work in the middle of the afternoon feeling as if i would vomit at my desk in the hallway in the elevator walking to the parking garage the entire way aleve works better than this stuff and aleve only keeps nausea at bay but does not cure migraines for me,"migraine, nausea, vomiting",1

416,i have had menstrual headaches so predictable for 10 years once a month 36 hours or so cant even lay on my head migraines just suffered through tried imitrex last december and feel like ive been freed from bondage i dont get a high or sleepy sensation just relief especially when taken with 2 advil i do not not have i ever uses prescription pain meds seldom use even any nsaids i was not interested in pain meds so this was a great option and a miracle i can even take 2 without side effects sorry to those who have poor outcomes fyi i was discussing it today with a colleague and she said she felt high and loopy i was stunned now in reading this i see some people do react that way so i guess i would say take half at home with someone around then make a choice from that result good luck,pain,1
417,saved my life nothing else worked other drugs intensified the headache i much prefer the injection less of the drug is needed and the effective result occurs more quickly side effects i can get nightsleep sweats and have odd dreams that do not otherwise occur,headache,1
418,i hated my experience with imitrex it made my chest feel strange heart beat increase and i felt very anxious while on it i guess it shortened the duration of my headache but i became very worried and preoccupied by its side effects,headache,1
419,i have taken imitrex ever since it came out in the 90s it works and ill be forever grateful that it does if you like me know what it was like to get migraines before imitrex came out youll understand why i sing its praise,,0
420,ive been suffering from migraines for years lasting three days in a row regularly to humour my body id take paracetamol ibuprofen cocodamol knowing they would not even touch the sides of these monstrous head pains nothing besides my daith piercing a piercing that is located in the innermost fold of your ear has worked until now enter sumatriptan its bizarre the way it works i can feel the blood vessels in my head contracting immediately and then i feel a pained pressure at the top of my nose it all seems to pulsate for about an hour after which my migraine has gone i take antisickness at the same time to counter the feelings of nausea and it does work although for plenty ohours afterwards i feel kind of odd a bit floaty a little bit dizzy and the pressure in my nose is still there but i think i prefer those shortlived symptoms to the three days of awfulness id been having until now within 12 hours all my symptoms seems to have gone,"migraine, nausea",1
421,i had a migraine so bad that i was vomiting and kept awake for days with pain so i went to the er they prescribed me 50 mg sumatriptan tablets ive been using them for almost a year and ive had really great success the best method i have found is to take a pill lay down in a dark room for an hour and hopefully sleep and when you get up your migraine will barely be there anymore sometimes it takes the migraine completely away on lucky days but most of the time it brings the pain down from an 8 or 9 to like a 1 or 2 ill still have the residue of a migraine but its ignorable the only side effect i have noticed is some minor nerve paintension on my scalp and face so if i touch my face or brush my hair the nerves there are overly sensitive its minor ignorable and totally worth it really grateful for this pill and would recommend,"migraine, pain, vomiting",1
422,awful taking the 50mg and 100mg gave me horrible side effects i can say my migraine went away but to get to that point i have to go through about an hour of uncontrollable crying tightness in my chest and throat very heavy almost numb limbs extreme body aches nausea cold sweats and a pounding headache never taking it ever again,"crying, headache, migraine, nausea",1

433,i have migraines that are hormonal in nature and imitrex has saved me from days worth of pain many a time i also have a gradeschool daughter and if i have a migraine believe me the entire family suffers the pain from a migraine can last 3 days for me so having something that will knock it out in a matter of minutes is in my eyes miraculous it doesnt always work especially if i have cluster headaches but 90 of the time it works for me on one dose if the first dose doesnt work i take another and that usually just completely wipes it out ,"migraine, pain",1
434,something that really works for me when my schedule allows is to take a short nap after taking imitrex i wake up with little discomfort my head is clear i can think one of the worst symptoms of my migraines is that i cannot stay focused on a task if i am unable to nap the imitrex has little effect on me this is horrible when you are at work as many of you know,discomfort,1

437,after i had my son i had horrible migraines sometimes daily i tried every over the counter medication including excedrin tylenol and ibuprofen i recently started taking imitrex its amazing it does take a while to kick in probably about an hour to 2 the pain goes away within about 20 minutes but i still have a pressure like feeling until about an hour or two later it also has really helped my depression maybe because of the serotonin element in the medication it doesnt make me tired or dizzy luckily i do feel relaxed but not in a bad way i really love it,"depression, pain",1
438,i have been suffering from migraines since around 16 and now at 36 although they have became less frequent over the years they are horrible as i usually am out for the entire day bedridden in a dark room i have always been very paranoid to try a actual migraine medicine so have taken vicodin for the pain i recently had a migraine at work and decided to try a imitrex my doctor prescribed me i was nervous to try it but am so happy i did i waited a few minutes of having the migraine before i took it but it relieved me of my migraine within 30 minutes i did experience some effects like muscle stiffness in my neck tightness in my face and a burning feeling in my nose and forehead for about a hour but ill take that any day over a migraine,"bedridden, migraine, muscle stiffness, neck tightness, pain, stiffness",1

440,the only medication that works for my migraines that last typically 3 days at a time right side of my head in my eye down the back of my neck and upper back i take the 100mg tablet 1 every 12 hours or when i feel it coming back on imitrex kicks in within 20 minutes of taking it as close to instant relief as you can get great medication,,0
441,best migraine medicine i have ever used the injection does hurt for a few seconds but the pain is gone as fast as it came within a few minutes i can feel the medicine rushing through my head it feels very heavy and leaves me with a dizzy sensation i usually need about an hour of sleep and then the migraine is gone completely i suffer about three migraines a week and only need a second dose about once a month pretty effective if you ask me i have noticed that if i am feeling nauseous already the medicine intensifies this i found that taking a sublingual anti nausea medicine a few minutes before the injection greatly reduces this side effect,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
442,i have suffered from migraine for many years before i started using imitrex about 15 years ago some migraines would affect me for days i missed out on so much back then imitrex changed that i normally can take one dose and get complete relief in an hour the only side effect that i have ever suffered is sleepiness but its not so severe that i cant take imitrex while working if a migraine strikes this medication has been a life saver for me and changed my quality of life,migraine,1
443,i go to a headache clinic to deal with my intense clustermigraine headache bouts my doctor asked me to try sumatriptan as an option for dealing with the worst headaches as soon as i feel them come on i liked the idea of having something to take only during headache periods as opposed to daily i had the opportunity to give it a shot this weekend and woah sumatriptan does not agree with my system shortly after taking it my scalp at the crown of my head felt like it was on fire so painful the back of my neck also seized up and i had to lie down even though it was impossible to get comfortable the good thing is that this medication has a short halflife two hours so my discomfort though intense was shortlived did my headache fade away absolutely but the discomfort it was swapped out for was arguably worse and so scary im returning the remainder of this prescription to the pharmacy for disposal,"discomfort, headache",1

446,at first i thought it was great no headache then the more frequently i used the medication to treat my migraines the more debilitating sideeffects i began to experience i could first mitigate the burningpain and weakness in my head neck and jaw and the general feeling of malaisefatigue by the administration of naproxen or ibuprofen prior to the imitrex but then even that ceased to be effective i finally quit after experiencing total body weakness a more severe burningpain in my upper extremeties than ever before accompanied by fluctuating hotcold sensations everywhere else irregular heartbeat and irregular breathing after administration if you experiencing adverse sideeffects it gets worse please find something else,headache,1
447,i have been using imitrex since it first came out in the 90s it was a god send ive had migraines for 42 years i get about six migraines a month imitrex always works but for me i pay a price with stomach aches sometimes i refrain from taking imitrex for fear of the stomach pains,fear,1

451,i have suffered from migraines for 32 years have taken several medications and combinations of said meds prescribed by my physician to combine this past year has been a mild one as far as migraines for me but have had around 13 i guess and we tried imitrex i can say that it has worked for me my migraines are triggered by the changes in barometric pressure due to weather so i almost always have them in spring and autumn,,0
452,i have suffered from migraines for many years but menopause has made the headaches both more intense and frequent the only medication that helps is sumatriptan typically the headache is gone within 30 minutes although it usually gets a little worse before it gets better there are side effects most notably jaw pain difficulty swallowing and a spacey feeling but honestly these are minor compared with the agony of a migraine i love this medication and do not know how i would manage without it,"headache, menopause, migraine, pain",1
453,having used paracetamol then migraleve with codeine these sumatriptan just didnt relieve the 8 day constant and intensified migraine pain i was experiencing on my second visit to the doctors in one week i was upgraded to stronger prescription meds of triptans and naproxen within 4 hours the pain and misery disappeared the pain was 910 and now 210 so i just wished the first dr had recommended this then so i didnt have to go through agony for 4 more days but hey i guess no one knows what strength is needed without going through the motions,"migraine, pain",1

468,everyone is different i react badly to many drugs but sumatriptan to my total surprise has so far helped with my migraines with very few side effects the pain doesnt respond to anything else ive tried aspirin paracetamol ibuprofen and even tramadol ive tried running singing rehydration salts hot packs cold packs nasal sprays and i dont know what else when the migraines got to the point that i couldnt sleep them off they are actually worse now after sleep i asked the doc for help and she prescribed sumatriptan 50mg and its like a miracle drug the pain goes away after about an hour i feel a bit manic and a bit dizzy after taking it but i feel dizzy and angry with the migraines anyway so thats a side effect im ok with at the moment note ive only been using it a couple of months and plan for this to be temporary while i investigate whether lifestyle changes will help me manage my headaches without drugs,pain,1

470,this drug will get rid of my migraine about 70 of the time but i only use it when nothing else works because the side effects are almost as bad as the migraine itself it makes my skin feel prickly and tight and my throat feels tight and like i cant swallow it gives me such intense nausea that i often dont speak when i take it because i feel like if i open my mouth ill throw up from trial and error the nausea seems to abate if i take it with food but if i forget to take it with food i have to force myself to eat through the nausea my brain also feels really foggy and basic actions are difficult when i take it im glad there are people who dont react like this but i am definitely asking to be switched to a different medication,"migraine, nausea",1
471,this medicine kept the migraine from becoming full blown it made me sleepy and out of sorts but this is better than an agonizing migraine i took it as soon as i saw the visual effect and within 30 min my vision was back to normal however i still had a mild migraine with very little nausea imitrex made me tired and my body felt heavy it also made my tongue feel swollen but it wasnt but id take this over a full blown migraine any day it seemed to fast forward the headache rather than it being debilitating like last time i still lay around all day though,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
472,the injection feels like a rubber band snapped on your skin i recommend the abdomen over the thigh much more comfortable i only bleed slightly and the site only bruised once the triptan effect is fast and intense you feel that rush of the migraine about to go away it makes me sleepy as sumatriptan always has and i nap for less than 12 hour then i am pain free the nice thing is the triptan effect goes away as rapidly as it comes on which is far better than the lingering yuck feeling with oral triptans not just pain reduction not a lessening of the migraine it is gone it has reduced my sick and late days due to migraine from 9 days in 2012 to zero so far in 2013 will never go without it again,"migraine, pain",1
473,very bad experiencereaction with only half a dose 1 did not take away headache 2 increase in pain heavy weight feeling on my chest shortness of breath cold sweats this med was a nightmare for me i felt immediate pain and pressure in head neck and shoulders the worst however was feeling like a one hundred pound weight on my chest additionally nausea and cold sweats and feeling like i was in big trouble practically and er trip beware of this med it may not be for everyone will go back to 3 advil and a coke or my fiorocet cure is worse than the disease in this case for me,"headache, nausea, nightmare, pain",1
474,ive just started taking imitrex the first time i took it i thought i was getting lock jaw i was quite worried i took it again the next day though because it did take care of my headache since the first time i took it the side effects have been minor hopefully it stays this way,headache,1

476,i have suffered from cluster headaches for over 15 years and have tried almost everything offered by hospitals and over the counter i recently was given imitrex in a nasal spray by my doctor and as long as your nasal passage is clear i have found that about five to ten minutes after you taste it in your throat the headaches go away it is the best medicine i have ever come across for cluster headaches and my days and nights are much better because of it,,0

478,imitrex does the trick of getting rid of my migraine every time but the side effects are a little rough i feel as though my neck and chest are tightening and achy but if i go to sleep about 10 minutes after taking imitrex i miss the side effects happening to me and just wake up feeling better,migraine,1
479,sumatriptan when taken as early as possible thankfully i can almost predict a migraine to the day because they are 13 days before my period get rid of the pain so well i dont even take anything else alongside it which i believe you can i get pain free inside 40 minutes with a little rest which is amazing when i know how brutal the migraines can be a small side effect is a tight feeling in the throat area but its so mild and the feeling only lasts an hour or two i know sumatriptan is not ideal for everyone the possible side effects can be offputting but as an otherwise fit and healthy lady i recommend it to similar people i only have 1 or two migraines a month the second seems to be an ovulation migraine caused by the sudden rise in hormones again predictable with a regular menstrual cycle im very lucky to only need one or two sumatran tablets a month 2 weeks apart im not sure i would want to be taking lots of these a month but for my needs they are a god send,"migraine, pain",1

481,i have been a migraine sufferer since 1993 as the years went by they got worse where over the counter medicines didnt help in 1996 i was diagnosed with migraines by a neurologist after going through test after test to rule out other medical problems believe me i actually had ask the doctor is it possible to cut that piece of brain out thats how severe they are he prescribed several different kinds of migraine medicines and none worked for me until he gave me imitrex this is actually a miracle pill yes the side effects are horrible and the migraine gets worse before it gets better but once its gone you are back to your normal life like you never had an episode i dont leave home without it,migraine,1

506,i wont lie it hurts like being snapped with a wet towel tail but not as much as my light sensitive migraines do my daughter also suffers from migraines and shes a big baby about pain but will take a dose before this my migraines would ruin my day i would have to lay in the dark with a bucket and suffer praying i could keep my oral medication down now i dosepro lay down for 30 minutes and i am back to normal it literally has changed my life anyone who suffers from migraines knows the feeling of a migraine building knowing that pain is coming and trying to head it off with oral meds and then failing to stop it the endless hours of horrific pain luckily my insurance covers it but id buy it whatever the cost,"migraine, pain",1
507,after suffering with cluster headaches for two years i was prescribed sumatriptan 100mg tablets which were effective if taken on an empty stomach they got to work in about 2030min which saved a good hour or so of debilitating pain so were great when the next bout hit i asked about the injections as the tablets didnt always workwork quick enough doctor agreed and i got imigran 6mg wow just wow aborts the headache within a couple of minutes of injection which is simple and easy they are a lifesaver and i would recommend anybody who suffers cluster headaches to ask your doctor about it in the uk theyre available on nhs my doctor was hesitant at first as apparently they cost 25 per 2 injection pack but they are worth it,"headache, pain",1
508,imitrex is a wonderful drug for us cluster heads ive not been without one on or about my person for the past 17 years im sure that all of us cluster suffers only wish that they would work a lot faster like the injectitons but i am sooooo thankful for them in any form a real life saver,,0
509,i have been using imitrex 5mg injections for several years as an emergency migraine abortive while it did instantly relieve the head pain and nausea i had to then wait out 3045 minutes of side effects those side effects were upper jaw pain and overall body aches like when you have the flu such as super sensitive skin even my hair hurt but for a long time this was the only option available to me through insurance and the side effects were more bearable than the migraine but recently the injection stopped working and i ended up having to go to the er now i have been given zomig nasal spray i have not had a reason to try it yet but am worried about side effects,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
510,i consider imitrex to be the geatest medicine in the world at least as far as my health is concerned i am never without the auto injector when a chronic headache comes on i inject myself 3 to 4 minutes later no pain my muscles are fatigued and im somewhat tired for about 30 minutes but no pain yes,"headache, pain",1
511,followed the instructions two 2 of the shots were defective out of 6 one was harmless and did not fire which only cost me 100 for the non performing shot the other did nothing until it fired accidentally into my eye seeking regulatory and legal help,,0
512,will not ever touch it again i suffer migraines so bad that i end up in the hospital almost on a regular basis well my doctor finally prescribed imitrex and i swore up and down that i wouldnt take it due to potential side effects but my head hurt so bad today that i threw in the towel and took one mind you im on the 100mg and it has done nothing but ignore my migraine causing it to manifest into a bigger one,migraine,1
513,i have been having cluster headaches for 15 years now i was just diagnosed 5 years ago so for the first 10 i was told oh its just migraines and was given multiple different medicines to prevent migraine which obviously didnt help so now im finally taking verapamil 3 times a day every 2 years or so my clusters come back and usually only last about a month i am currently in my episodal period and has lasted over 2 months now i take sumatriptan for when i get a cluster but insurance only pays for 9 pills a month and they work but 9 a month does not work because anyone with clusters know that you could have 5 or 6 a day,migraine,1
514,i have suffered from migraines for 32 years the older i am the worse they become i have both the imitrex pills the shots when i am nauseated i must use the shot approx 1 minute after injection the intense buring in my head the amplified headache are the worst side effects however nothing compared to the migraine usually the migraine is gone in 15 30 mins and i sleep it off there is also the 12 24 hour imitrex hangover from the shot muscles feel as though they are made of jelly overall wiped out feeling the pill does not have the burning effect for me and it takes the full 30 minutes to combat the migraine imitrex is the only medicine which has worked for me consistantly over the years i become immune to all other medicines,"hangover, headache, migraine",1
515,i take sumatriptan for the onset of my migraines and nausea that come along with my cvs on bad days they help a lot the only thing is i usually have to take more than one dose and the medication is expensive even with insurance,nausea,1
516,im 35 months pregnant and had been suffering from the worst migraine id ever experienced for 2 days i finally went to urgent care as instructed by my ob they gave me an injection of imitrex the side effects suck i felt dioriented and my head felt heavy i was sweating after about 20 minutes the side effects subsided a bit and i was able to go it is now 2 hours later and i feel 100 times better my migraine is basically gone if you can deal with the side effects its worth it,"migraine, sweating",1
517,imitrex makes me more nauseous than i am with just the headache my neck and shoulders get very stiff and it takes more than an hour to feel any relief as others have said however if i am able to take this medicine and lie down it does wonders life just isnt that practical though so i cant use it anymore,headache,1
518,i have had migraines for as long as i could remember especially when its bright loud noises or when im on my phone i had a really bad migraine and i took a tablet as directed and i felt horrible after so bad it brought me to tears the migraine worsened and i felt nauseous and sick never will take again,migraine,1
519,injections are expensivebut they are the only thing that i have found that work for my cluster headaches truly a lifesaver the burning sensation is ugly but better than the viciousness ripping of my head to pieces,burning sensation,1
520,lifesaver this med has helped give me my life back i occasionally had 3 days of lights off ice pack cool quiet bedroom time for the pain often to the point of vomiting ive been on it for years and take the injections with warm tingly side effects but completely worth it i crash for an hour with an ice pack when i get up i feel fantastic love ,"pain, vomiting",1
521,migraines impacted school and work and honestly i felt hopeless when experiencing them i would see things that made me scared feel intense tingling sensations and nausea my triggers are so far dairy caffeine neck stiffness dehydration when i do get a migraine i only take 13 to 14 of the pill im petite frame and sensitive and taking the full pill knocked me on the floor useless for about 5 hours feeling very heavy and highout of it side effects i notice are drowsy slow heavy numbness in throat sensitivity to hot water which is mostly noticeable for about 2 hours ideally i will take one when i am able to either nap or go to bed for the night and i wake up feeling great if i take one during the day i will absolutely avoid driving or operating any machinery at work,"dehydration, migraine, nausea, neck stiffness, numbness, stiffness",1
522,before imitrex i had migraines that would last 2 day i finally went to emergency to get a shot of demerol and then sometimes it would not work i would be right there with my bowl sun glass on waiting my turn i was put on imitrex when it first came out and the long term effect was not for sure on people anything is better than a migraine headache i started taking the shots and at first it made me feel a little funny for first 2 minute then it cleared up and within 15 minutes my migraine was gone after using it for a while i developed an immunity to it i then had to use 2 shots my doctor at the time had me stop using it it was a great medication for migraines back then,"headache, migraine",1

526,sumatriptan has changed the way i live i suffered from migraine sinus stress and daily headaches for almost 10 years at their worst they could last up to 3 weeks with no subsidence id literally wake up with and go to bed with that cycle allevery day i tried everything oils supplements herbal tracking triggers nothing worked i was miserable and couldnt plan a thing it was a guarantee that id have to cancel i reluctantly but desperately popped along to the doctor who gave me sumatriptan they vary when they kick in must depend on whats going on in my body but usually within an hour only rarely do i need more than one on any given day ive never looked back side effects vary sensitivity a bit slower but sometimes nothing at all i have high blood pressure but i swear i couldnt live without them hopefully no long term damage but they way i see it my life was a prison of pain before anyway,"migraine, pain, stress",1
527,ive been using sumatriptan for my menstrual migraines for 5 years or so now im 24 years old although i get several of the listed side effects muscle weakness tingling burning sensation drowsiness to name a few it works so quickly at getting rid of the pain i couldnt be without it now the side effects only last an hour or so so its completely worth it,"burning sensation, drowsiness, pain",1
528,im a 34 migraines per week person when i first tried imitrex i thought i had found my own personal miracle even on days that i didnt have a full blown migraine i would still have pain and this was the first time i felt completely pain free in years unfortunately the honeymoon wore off after about 8 months i used imitrex quite frequently during that time and had wonderful results even though sometimes i had to take two pills to really do the job but after eight months 2 pills werent doing the job my headache was still lingering ,"headache, migraine, pain",1

531,from the moment i started taking imitrex in 1996 it has worked wonderfully for me with probably only two or three occasions over the years where a headache has persistent it is been my wonder drug i do get very frequent migraines and take as little of it is possible but i will normally take 10 to 12 50mg tablets per month with few if any side effects,headache,1
532,my migraine headache started when i was 16 or 17 years old now i am 53 years old i have migraine headache about once a week unless when i am on vacation usually i have them on monday afternoons because its the first day of the work and i think my eyes get tired or maybe i have more stress but i can get migraine for the number of reasons last night for first time i used imitrex i had awful feelings i cannot describe them but after couple hours my migraine was gone i got very sleepy but it felt very good the best part is that the next day i had no headache either because my headaches usually takes 2 days to go away i hope that it works next week as well,"headache, migraine, stress",1
533,doctor gave me a sample and a prescription of this to try i have used treximet with great results but it took too long for the medicine to into my system to counter the migraine the sumavel works great however it does hurt the initial injection is painful i was left with a welt and a tender spot for hours afterwards the injection pain is well worth the relief i do get the burning sensation at the bottom of my brain stem 30 seconds after the injection and feel very weak this is all normal as i got the same feeling when i start treximet luckily my insurance company covers it,"burning sensation, migraine, pain",1
534,helpless migraine victim for 20 years my dr recommended imitrex so i took it i took one 100mg it tasted horrible i had an upset stomach for almost 4 hours i did get a heartburn feeling in my chest hotflash mood swings but my migraine disappeared i will speak to my neurologist regarding my side effects i would consider using imitrex again in the future,"heartburn, migraine, mood swings, upset stomach",1
535,took my husband to doctor while suffering a severe migraine with vomiting which he has suffered from his whole life12 a month to the point of vomiting after not being able to keep down pills this was his only hope of relief had first injection at doctors office and within 15 minutes he had relief and was even able to go in to work the same day i am so happy there is something that cures his pain he said the shot hurt but it was worth it the cost is high but also worth it when he is in that much pain we paid 200 with discount card for 6 injections you can find the discount card on their website highly recommend when nothing else has helped,"migraine, pain, vomiting",1
536,i have used fiorinal for years and had no problems however my migraines have gotten worse over the last few months i took a 100 mg imitrex yesterday and the side effects were terrible my neck head throat shoulders all became tight and felt as though i was high per se i finally had to go up to bed and calm myself i slept for 5 hours and woke up feeling groggy if i need to take it again i will break it in half it was a scary feeling they only gave me 6 pills thank goodness i will stick with the fiorinal and a cup a coffee,,0
537,this drug has saved me i was getting anywhere from 4 to 10 migraines a month and losing a day or two each time not to mention the pain the nausea the depressed feeling you get when youre stuck in bed feeling terrible my doctor told me to try this prescribed 100mg so i did cannot say enough good things about this drug pain is entirely gone after 30 minutes and i have had no side effects take it as soon as you know youre heading for a migraine dont bother waiting to see if its going to go away on its own because chances are its going to get worse practice selfcare also and know your triggers but if all else fails take one of these because they work i have to go to the pharmacy now to refill the prescription last thing i want is to wake up with a headache and no sumatriptan on hand,"headache, migraine, nausea, pain",1
538,the first time i used the dosepro i was leary within 10 minutes i was not only relieved of my migraine but it was the most clear headed i felt in forever the second dose i took i was not near my medicine and i had a full blown migraine so it wasnt as good but a very close second i love this freedom to make plans and not have to worry about cancelling due to migraine yeah,"migraine, worry",1
539,i took one pill at onset then took a second pill after 2 hours of no relief as directed i spent a total of 5 hours puking and uncoordinated except for the hour the 2nd pill knocked me out with drowsiness my migraine never subsided and continued to rage in full force during and after the side effects will not take again,"drowsiness, migraine, rage",1
540,im only 16 and i was prescribed it at 15 and told only to take it when my migraines were unbearable every time i have taken it i usually get a really sick feeling such as hot flashes weakness nausea and dizzy theres always like a feeling that my brain is being frozen over from where the migraine mostly is but i always take it and go straight to sleep except for last night i stayed up and i was seeing and hearing things that werent there i couldnt do simple tasks i forgot where my room was after my boyfriend told me to drink some water i cried over everything i was scared of everything staying awake for me was horrifying,"migraine, nausea",1
541,ive had migraines since i was 5 and theyve been chronic since my 20s im mid40s now i havent been able to find a preventative that works but i respond really well to the triptans even if i catch a migraine late a triptan will still abort it for me the downside i get more migraines each month than pills and i get rebounds pretty bad for the past 1015 years imitrex sumatriptan and relpax eletriptan have been my gotos ive been having some gastritis issues so we decided to try onzetra instead of oral sumatriptan to bypass my stomach awful choice two doses of onzetra barely took the edge off the migraine and ive been in severe pain ever since counting the minutes until 24 hours is up and i can take a relpax ill be switching back to my regular sumatriptan pills asap,"gastritis, migraine, pain",1
542,sumatriptan works amazing to take away my migraine as soon as i feel the tell tale pain above my eyebrow however i experience severe side effects such as jaw pain that prevents me from opening my mouth very far and chewingswallowing i also get tired and spaced out after taking this the drug takes maybe 30 minutes to kick in and removes the migraine pain entirely which is why i still rated it as effective works first time and every time i never have to take a second dose,"migraine, pain",1
543,i have been using imitrex for over a year now it works very well for me i had some trouble with chest pain for awhile my neurologist told me to try 14 to 12 tablet 2550mg this has worked for me the headache goes away and all side effects are diminished i found that the side effects varied depending on the manufacturer there is something like a 7 variance in dosage a 100 mg tablet can contain as little as 93 mg or as much as 107 mg of sumatriptan also some coatings dissolve faster than others therefore more severe side effects if the sumatriptan is absorbed too rapidly,"chest pain, headache, pain",1
544,i told my primary care physician of headaches i was having not especially severe but very persistent and not responding well to otc meds it would often require several otc doses over two to three days to obtain relief he gave me some relpax samples and i took one at the onset of the next headache i had relief in about thirty minutes i was extremely pleased and continued use of the relpax for perhaps two years until my insurer refused to cover that med any longer due to cost my primary care prescribed sumatriptan as a replacement it was equally effective usually providing relief in as little as fifteen minutes i used sumatriptan for perhaps three more years then my headaches simply stopped completely have not had a headache requiring medication in the last six years cant explain it but ill take it i never experienced noticeable side effects with either medication am currently sept 2020 71 year old male,headache,1
545,it works well when you can get to inject this prescription with out insurance is over 90000 i have had numerous instances where it did not inject i have 3 out of 6 in my last prescription that failed i just got satisfaction on a failed injector from january 2016 i now take the same prescription and it only is a 10 co pay where suma vel is 150 co pay robbery and the endo pharmasuticals shood be ashamed,,0
546,the first few years i was prescribed imitrex i thought it was a miracle drug now after ten years i find that i need to add excedrine migraine with it and i still have residual pain stillit sure beats a full blown migraine,"migraine, pain",1
547,it worked to abort a cluster headache just as effective but not any more so than the needle version of imitrexsumatriptan the injection stung quite a bit and left a fairly nasty welt similar to a wasp sting and it bled a little bit but it worked as advertised,"cluster headache, headache",1
548,i have always had problems with migraines about two and a half years ago id had a migraine for about two weeks straight and absolutely nothing would get rid of it i got fed up and went to the doctor they prescribed me with 100mg sumatriptan constant migraines have subsided but i will still get the occasional one and it almost always happens when i drive long distances but for example i just drove back to ohio from virginia and just after i got to ohio my head was killing me i had stopped at a rest area and had some of the pro drome symptoms going on as well i tried to tough it out but couldnt handle it so i took one i stopped at the next rest area and hung out for about a half hour or so and felt well enough to start driving again about 2030 minutes later the migraine was gone it takes my body a little while for it to work through but hey i do get some nausea and stiff neckshouldersface but id rather deal with that than the debilitating migraine,"migraine, nausea",1
549,these injections are a god send for clusterers the only drawback that i experienced was the expense which forbids me from using them on a regular basisbut the tablets are a good substitute just takes much longer to work the injections work almost instantly,,0
550,this drug works but not sure if its worth the scary side effects it usually takes around 4045 minutes for the drug to actually get rid of the headache in that time my neck will get very stiff itll feel like my head is like a bowling ball ill feel pretty weak and unfocused today i took it and had a numb tingling feeling in my left hand that went away after a few minutes then i started feeling heavy in my tongue next the left side of my mouth and cheek starting going numb for a minute there i thought i was having a stroke luckily the numbness didnt last more than 10 minutes but talk about freaky the rest of the day ive been absolutely exhausted basically dont plan on being able to have a productive day at work if youre going to take this at least in my experience ive only taken it twice but the side effects have been the same,"headache, numbness",1
551,gets rid of my headaches easily but sometimes takes an hour before it works taking it on an empty stomach seems to speed up things the only down side is they are quite expensive even with insurance,,0
552,after three solid weeks with vestibular migraine tinnitis nausea and no sleep i have finally found what works mild dizziness especially when bending tinnitis is there no dopey feeling and i am finally relaxed i tried everything elsetopomax was a disaster b12 shot heatcold alcohol no alcohol diet sleep toradol benedryl shot phenergan only way to sleep and not be sick thank goodness too bad i have no insurance and it costs a fortune,"dizziness, migraine, nausea",1
553,had these headaches since i was 11 in my 20s did every test scan etc no explanation only help offered was a highly addictive narcotic i chose to skip it my life was severely affected i had headaches when happy sad having fun pms special occasion etc everyone knew my headaches were 3 days of barely functioning then my daughter started getting them game changer for me could not let her suffer the same way dr prescribed imitrex generic it works for both of us we feel like we can live without fear of the next one she is out of the country for 6 weeks without this she never could have gone our lives are totally different now,fear,1
554,ive suffered with tension headache and migraine for years and nothing has ever really helped with the pain until now as soon as i feel one coming one i take one tablet and the pain is gone with 2030 minutes the only downside to using this medicine is the side effects i have hot flushes and a heavy burning sensation in my legs almost like growing pains but i much rather the side effects than the headache,"burning sensation, headache, migraine, pain, tension, tension headache",1
555,i have high regard for imitrex and the generic first provided by dr reddy was equal to the original imitrex however i have recently been required to use a different generic and it is basically worthless i was taking 50 milligrams and having the migraine gone within an hour now a 100 milligram tablet has little effect and i usually have to take a second 100 milligram tablet to get any relieve i would sure like to know how the generic industry works because for me it does not seem to be quite up to speed at least with the drug that i need most,migraine,1
556,i suffer with very bad anxiety and stress so as a result of this i get regular tension headaches normal painkillers paracetomol ibuprofen etc dont work so i visited my gp who prescribed sumatriptan and from day one of using these the headaches went within one hour in my experience they are the best medication for headaches im lucky i dont have any side effects as some of my friends do,"anxiety, stress, tension",1
557,imitrex nasal sprays changed my life i developed migraines when i was about 13 years old at that time the doctor would simply prescribe pain killers for treatment but they did nothing they only helped me sleep for a few hours and then i would wake back up to the headache again after seeing a neurologist i was prescribed imitrex i have tried all three forms of the medication the pills did not work as well for me because i always vomit with a migraine i simply did not get enough doses with the injections to last a month only two in a prescription but with the nasal sprays i receive 6 each month and they work great,"headache, migraine, pain",1
558,this was the first time i took it got a migraine 2 days in a row after getting auras worked for me i still had pain but very very minimal compared to the past i havent had a migraine in 19 months before this,"migraine, pain",1
559,the medication itself is effective and clears a migraine in about 10 minutes however my pen always breaks eventually and sometimes my replacement pens are faulty as well i have a reserve of the medication because i have been unable to take it they need to design a better injection system,migraine,1
560,ive had migraines about 46 times a month since early puberty and after a few hospital visits my mother finally took me to a specialist and got a sumatriptan prescription it has greatly improved my quality of life it kicks in after about 40 minutes for me longer than advertised but im on a small dosage due to my small frame it does leave me feeling heavy and numb and it has made me nauseated on occasion its uncomfortable but much better than a migraine,"migraine, puberty",1
561,i have chronic cluster headaches the injections are the only medicine that will abort an attack i have used the injections with no side effects for over 10 years i get the vials and inject 23 ml i have overused this medicine at times knowing it can cause rebounds but the pain of a cluster headache is so severe i will do anything to make it stop i have no history of heart disease and am relatively healthy otherwise this medicine has saved my life,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1

563,ive suffered from cyclic vomiting for over 10 years and the only thing that brings me reliefive suffered for over a week before with the intense vomiting and dibilitating migraines and had to be hospitalized due to dehydration and pain and panic attacksmy gp actually prescribed me the injectable form and at the first sign i take an injection then usually wait 10 minutes and give myself a second injection and this medication has saved my life,"dehydration, pain, vomiting",1

568,ive been dealing with episodes of cluster headaches for 30 years nothing has ever made a dent in the pain besides this and zomig nasal spray the slight pain of the injection is a very small price to pay to relieve the crushing pain of a cluster headache for me the trick for both medicines is to catch it as early as possible before the headache is full blown im never more than a minute or two away from a dose besides feeling a little weak afterwards which would have been worse with the headache anyway so far i dont have any real side effects,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1

598,i have had chronic migraines for as long as i can remember to the point where i cant even talk to answer questions walk straight i have been accused of being drunk or high because if it they could last up to three days the first time i tried imitrex it was quite literally the holy grail from then on the pills take away any aura or migraine in about 20 to 30 minutes and the shots give immediate relief wether or not its a placebo i swear to the gods as soon as you inject into your upper thigh your migraine goes down a few pegs within a few minutes nearly or entirely gone if you have migraines or clusters ask your doctor dont take irresponsibly because it can have some weird effects on people,"aura, migraine",1

605,i was diagnosed with severe migraines a little over a year and a half ago i was prescribed nortriptyline as an everyday medication and imitrex as a needed emergency pain reliever the nortriptyline doesnt always work and since i am a teenager i am still in school if i get a migraine in school i am supposed to take an imitrex and go straight back to class unfortunately for me the imitrex makes me extremely drowsy and sometimes delirious usually forcing me to go home and still live with the pain of migraines for at least another 12 hours but it can still last for up to 3 days afterwards thankfully the nortriptyline works 95 of the time but the imitrex only works a good 75 of the time and then im still put out of commission,"migraine, pain",1

609,had clusters 37 years now ive tried literally everything out there the only thing that works for immediate relief is imitrex injections if med takes too long nasal or pill it simply doesnt work gabapentin sp regime should be started immediately they eventually stop the nerve from spasms imitrex is now available generic sumatriptan however still expensive i pay 75shot only available as a twopack,,0

620,i recently started taking sumatriptan it was ok at first i took it whenever i felt a migraine coming on and it usually took care of most of my symptoms some sensitivity to light and sounds continued but for migraines at work which i would get all the time it is terrible because of the sleepiness i often will have to try to fight all day at work just to stay awake,migraine,1

626,i have a serious issue with migraines almost 6 a week when the device was first prescribed back in 2010 i did not have a problem since they were coming from san diego from telegenics once endo started producing the product all i have are failures i have had as many as 5 of 6 in a box fail to work i have had several that after i tried to use them they spontaneously went off on the bathroom counter luckily not in my face i have contacted endo at this point now early august 2016 i have not received even 1 replacement for the 18 that failed you know the cost my insurance will stop paying for them in a couple of months i reported every one to endo but the issue is getting worse i have reported this chronic issue to the fda,,0
627,been experiencing migrainesheadaches since i could remember im unable to take nsaids so meds such as cambia are not an option for me which helped but not as well daily medications such as topamax were not effective enough to warrant the extreme fatigue finally after requesting an as needed dosing med a doctor prescribed this one took dose shortly after symptoms began oral tab took roughly an hour to take effect but it really helped i had option for 2nd dose but felt enough relief to get through evening had some side effects but they were tolerable and did not worry me since i read what to expect ahead of time side effects short lived comared to constant fatigue of alternatives and worth the relief i received,"fatigue, worry",1
628,im 59 years old and have experienced migraines since age 5 imitrex is the best drug ive used i take 100 mg at the first sign and it prevents it 80 of the time if taken after the headache starts it stops the pain within 1 hour and much faster if i lay down yes there are mild side effectsdrowsiness sensitivite to hot and cold but it sure is better than a headache,"headache, pain",1
629,i have suffered from migraines since i was 20 and am now 34 i have tried countless abortive medicines sumavel is the best one by far because it relieves the pain and nausea fast usually within 10 mins for me the injection is painful and leaves quite a welt but far worth it to get relief i do sometimes have issues with it not firing properly but it could be just me pulling back at the last second when i anticipate the pain coming i have wasted quite a few shots this way,"nausea, pain",1
630,ive been having cluster headaches for about 5 years i take the pill form of imitrex i sometimes have to take two of them the first one seems to take the edge off but after two hours i end up taking another one which eventually gets rid of the awful pain in the eye i wish they would work quicker and better but at least it helps i have chronic cluster headaches so when theres a short lived period of no headaches im relieved im not tried the other forms of imitrex but i might mention it to my doctor,pain,1
631,have had migraines on and off for years i used fioricet the last 8 years with good results but then my system must have changed that they did not work anymore after talking to an neurologist and having blood work etc done she put me on imitrex sumatriptan 100mg which worked great only thing i do is split these into 50mg pieces and they still work good from reading on different forums i did notice a lot of our fellow migraine sufferers get relief from 25 to 50mg also i have not had any side effects taking the 100mg only negative for me is that they are pricey about 10 for 9 pills why nine who knows but they work and its worth it to me,migraine,1
632,well i was having really bad cluster headaches i took an imitrex for the first time with in 15 mins i was projectile vomiting and having bad stomach cramps the taste stayed in my mouth for hours my headache has went down some but it was still there,"headache, stomach cramps, vomiting",1
633,i have had migraines for over 10 years and have tried many different drugs my doctor gave me sumavel to try about a week ago just in time for another migraine attack the initial injection did hurt but the relief that i was able to get only 10 minutes later was well worth it i did have the burning sensation in my face for a few minutes and felt weak for about 30 minutes but for me that is much better than the pain of a migraine the only problem that i had was it seemed to only work for a few hours for me the first time i tried it im willing to give this medicine time to work because it has by far done so much more for me than any other medicine that i have tried,"burning sensation, migraine, pain",1
634,this review is for the injectable form of imitrex sumatriptan only for anyone that has tried the pill or nasal spray forms and found them ineffective please try the injections they work wonders and act fast ive tried the other types and they actually seemed to make me more nauseous and especially the nasal spray i keep one in my purse at all times so that i can get relief anytime a migraine hits the pain is not bad as the needle is very small and thin you dont have to jab yourself just press against your skin and push a button the pain of migraine is much worse ive found the most comfortable injection site to be the bit of fat at the top of my buttox i use the 6mg injections but im pretty sure there is also a lower dose,"migraine, pain",1
635,i find imitrex to be very effective against my migraines as long as i take it at the start of one the first and second time i took imitrex i experienced stomach cramps the next time i had to take it i had eaten shortly before and this greatly reduced the cramping if im nauseous i obviously wont be able to eat a full meal but the cramps do seem to be decreasing each time i take it anyway the only other side effects i have are a burning sensation in my nose and a sore throat which are both tolerable imitrex is very expensive but definitely worth it to me i can take a tablet lay down for an hour or two and then get back up to live life again,"burning sensation, stomach cramps",1
636,i love this medicine before i would always worry about the next time i was going to get a headache i couldnt work or play with my son i hated it but now if i get one i can just take my imitrex and 30 minutes later its gone like i never had a headache at all the only thing i dont like is it is pricey but i will pay because it works very well now that i have tried it i couldnt live without it,"headache, worry",1
637,i get migraines with aura right when i begin to lose my vision i know the migraine is 30 minutes away i take an imitrex as soon as i start to lose my vision it works within an hour or two about 80 of the time i feel very weak and out of it when i do take one it still doesnt help with nausea however i have not thrown up from a migraine yet just very nauseous i have also used the injectable version that works so much better however i have psyched myself out and can no longer give myself a shot for some reason physical therapy has really helped with my migraines i also quit going to the chiropractor i used to get migraines weekly now its been 6 months and i finally got one today,"aura, migraine, nausea",1
638,the injectable version works well for my infrequent every 23 months migraines it stops them dead in their tracks the only downside is it leaves me feeling a little out of as if id better not operate any heavy machinery i also err by not taking it as soon as the pain hits thats because i hate jabbing myself with a needle bizarrely i also get migraines with aura but no pain the aura is only visible in my left eye and looks like fluttering black fringe so weird the first time it happened i was sure i was having a brain bleed when it went away without my dying or having a stroke i figured it was just my brain chemistry throwing a party one with black streamers,"aura, pain",1
639,i have used sumatriptan 100mg for years and it has worked sometimes it takes an hour so but it works recently my pharmacy switched the manufacturer from drreddy to sun after taking the sun brand of symatriptan the migraine went away in about 20 minutes and i felt euphoric i was in bed so it was a welcome feeling i was wondering if anyone else has had that experience it was strange but wonderful ,migraine,1
640,imitrex shot is a very effective drug for me have had migraines for decades and was introduced to imitrex after 2 years of having blinding aura then 2 days of suffering in a dark room imitrex shot works within minutes no pain killer needed once i give myself the shot i lay down for about an hour only issues are brief fatigue nausea for a few minutes and a strange prickly sensation in the top of my head which goes away quickly,"aura, fatigue, nausea, pain",1
641,i love this medicine it has given me back my life when i first started taking it i would get super tired and have to sleep for an hour but i have been taking for a year and have no side effects any more for me it starts working within 10 min and the migraine is gone with in an hour most of the time i dont even need to take a full dose just a half of a pill the only bummer is my insurance company will only let me have so many of these pills every 20 days and because i suffer from migraine all but maybe 4 days a month i run out,migraine,1
642,i take sumatriptan for menstrual migraines and this medication has been an absolute lifesaver for me if i take a 50 mg tablet when the migraine starts i have 100 relief within 30 minutes if i wait until the migraine is really bad then it takes about an hour to kick in my migraines generally last 2 days and the first dose wears off in about 12 hours so i usually have to take another dose the only side effects i experience are a slight head rush that goes away after about 10 minutes i would recommend trying to take a nap after taking this medication which really helps,migraine,1
643,i have suffered from terrible migraines for the past 7 years and saw no relief in sight once i tried this needless injection it has changed my life for the better i was nervous to give myself the injection but i had my sister help me for moral support the injection did sting and bleed just a little but any migraine sufferer would not mind a little sting over the pain of a migraine i did get lightheadeddizzy for a few minutes however my migraine was gone within 5 minutes awesome medicine it gave me my life back i highly recommend it,"migraine, pain",1
644,i had a terrible migraine on friday and went to the doctors office the gave me a dose of imitrex and within 15 minutes my headache was gone it did make me feel nauseated and my cheeks were tingling but it was 100x better than the headache,"headache, migraine",1
645,hi all so i have suffered migraine for 35yrs now initially was on sumatriptan tabs only didnt particularly work so after much pleading with gp in oct finally saw neuro they gave me nortriptyline 25mg for a week then increased the dose to 50mg and zomigtriptan dissolve 25mg for when i get a migraine so i was doing fantastic from oct to jan no migraine and going from 3 a mth on average for what seems a lifetime to nothing was amazing until january i had two week long ones and another early feb anyway i saw consultant yesterday 26th feb was upped to 75mg nortriptyline and given imigran injection to try sods law developed one yesterday pm so took first injection at 1115am and within an hour i felt better but not 100 so im unsure what to think i can manage my day but wearing my special glasses and no throbbing but teeny bit of pain i hope with increasing the nortriptyline all will be well xx,"migraine, pain",1
646,this is a comment about my own use this stuff is a joke because the box only comes with 6 single shot nasal sprays meanwhile during a cluster period ill get from 3 to 6 excruciatingly painful cluster headaches in a 24 hour period box will cure basically 6 headaches which lasts no more than 3 or 4 days during cluster period and thats while trying to conserve the problem is most insurance will only pay for 1 box per month which leaves me missing work and banging my head against the wall for the other 2527 days of the month i dont know who made this medicine and why they would market it for clusters knowing that when people are in a cluster attack period get up to 6 or 7 suicide headaches per day terrible overall medicine,suicide,1
647,just took it for the first time today use to use maxalt this drug completely knocked me out so sleepy and tired not to mention feeling very weird its been 7 hours and i feel not great headache gone but left with fatigue and dizziness back to maxalt ,"dizziness, fatigue, headache",1
648,works great for me can take 14 or 12 tablet most of time have only taken whole tab on rare occasions migraine is usually triggered by irregular or lack of sleep or tension this medicine makes me sleepy most times im 100 functional within 20 minutes no side effects,"migraine, tension",1
649,took the pain away in 15 min the injection site bruises and bleeds but still worth it i felt the nausea associated with this medication for about the first 10 mins and extreme tiredness got it as a sample but will for sure fill the prescription most effective and fastest working migraine medicine so far,"migraine, nausea, pain",1
650,i have had great success with treating my migraines with this medication with in 5 min of the injection or 10 to 20 min with the pill i can feel my headaches tension and the aura and nausea symptoms subside for those who take pain meds or a severe bleeding disorder caused by defective gene in the liver ask your doctor if this could be whats happening in your blood stream and central nervous system from pain pills this is not intended to treat or be a diagnosis or cure for anyones diesease its only intended to ask your doctor about to see if it could reduce your headache problems this comes from a patient who is 37 years old with a severe blood clotting disorder and suffers from pain and narcotic pain killer induced rebound headaches,"aura, clotting, headache, nausea, pain, tension",1
651,imitrex has long been the gold standard for migraine sufferers cluster headache suffers a much rarer but more painful form of headache and even those who suffer from just occasional really painful headaches but not frequent enough to be characterized as the migraine or cluster variety after speaking to your physician about the safety of you using imitrex ask for sumavel dose from zogenix prefilled units that get the medication in your blood within 3 minutes amazing,"cluster headache, headache, migraine",1
652,those injections for my headaches that the doctor gave me are amazing i wake up with my headache a lot so i cant even stop them before they start and like this morning theyre usually paired with nausea and i end up throwing up this injection is awesome though quick relief without having to make a trip to the er i usually get toradol shots at the hospital that make the headache disappear within twenty minutes of so the initial injection of the sumavel hurt a little and caught me off guard but it felt like a bee sting it just hurt for a second and then it was over it bled a little bit and about a minute after my head started to feel heavy and i felt a little dizzy i went to sleep woke up and feel better ,"headache, nausea",1
653,i can make the injections last by using only 13 a vial per cluster attack i take the vial out of the auto injector and use a qtip to press in the amount after this i wait exactly 9 minutes and the headache is gone i had a very hard time getting enough injections from my insurance to cover all the cluster headaches i was getting and this method helped me handle 3x more than i could before i do feel my headache pain jumping from a 3 10 immediately after injection taking the 100mg tablets does not cause this increase in pain but the wait is about 2530 mins for relief sometimes i can tell which headaches to use either the injection or pill for,"headache, pain",1
654,i just took 100mg two hours ago the first ten minutes were fine next 30 minutes i felt dazed and heavy next 30 minutes i felt fine migraine gone but after those 30 minutes you know the feeling you get when you laugh or smile too long and your cheeks hurt well that is everywhere just pure exhaustion with occasional pain stiff neck on the side i usually get migraine pain possible fever lots of nausea right now random but i sneezed and it killed in my neck glands are swollen throat isnt tight though ,"exhaustion, migraine, nausea, pain",1
655,absolutely amazing never found anything that could take away a migraine until my doctor prescribed this my migraines are gone within 20 minutes of the shot ive suffered with them since a child and now at 25 i found something that really works this medication is a blessing to me,migraine,1
656,at first i suffered through them this included splitting head pain nausea and vomiting i started using excedrin after a while which helped if i took it right away then that started to not work so well anymore i had one really bad one that lasted hours i was still throwing up at 9 pm and i was now throwing up blood i went to the er and when i finally got in they put me on an iv to hydrate me they then added imitrex to the bag and i soon started feeling side effects my head felt like i was going to pass out my breathing became labored and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest they said that meant it was working after about two minutes everything was gone i got pills to take at home and they worked okay not as fast,"nausea, pain, vomiting",1
657,i used my first sumavel dosepro last night i woke up about 11pm with a splitting migraine my migraines last between 12 to 16 hours i took the shot and within ten minutes the headache was gone i dont mean dulled i mean gone this was a miracle in my book the injection was a little painful im good with that finally quick relief for my migraines which have plagued me for over 43 years,"headache, migraine",1
658,i have read many of the other reviews of sumavel dosepro and agree that i have had some not fire when i go to inject myself i have learned to be patient and continue to hold the applicator in place and continually push it into my skin until the injector fires it sometimes takes a while but it does eventually goes off you just need to be patient yes its frustrating but when you have a migraine its worth the wait this has been a miracle drug for me and i will continue to use it as long as it is available to me,migraine,1
659,i was prescribed this medication for migraine i took it at work during my lunch for the first timebig mistake my head felt like a swollen balloon i was disoriented loopy delusional heavy weird as ever and very tired i wanted to lay down on my desk and cry or go home but i could not my dosage was 100 mg the next time i took it i cut it in half and it was not as bad of a feeling than before i recommend to try it at home first to see how your body reacts firstnot at work lol,migraine,1
660,i have tried both the injection and tablet and its has worked wonders i have suffered with migraines since i was middle school now 31 yrs old and this is the first medicine that has given me any relief the side effects only last for about 10 minutes so its no problem the only issue i have is after about 4 or 5 hours the migraine seem to start up right either way any relief is better than suffering through a migraine,migraine,1
661,ive suffered from migraines since i was in the 3rd grade and i am now 23 i take topamax every night to try and control my headaches but when i get a really bad one i use the sumavel hate hate hate needles so this works for me very good there is pain with the injection but compared to the migraine its nothing a little bleeding at the site and always a bruise i can instantly feel the medicine working in my body and within 57 minutes my migraine is gone its my miracle,"migraine, pain",1
662,so last night i felt a migraine coming on in the back of my head i took my dosage of 50 miligrams and fell fast asleep no side effects woke up feeling refreshed i had worried and quickly decided it may be different for others as to the reviews i have read ,migraine,1
663,imitrex pills worked for me for a few years but then it stopped being as effective and i had to take 2 then that stopped working so i tried imitrex statdose the injections and they work wonders they hurt a lot but the pain in my leg after i give it to myself is far less horrible than the migraine pain i give myself the shot and lie down for about 15 minutes and im fine maybe a little pain but i feel much better im also on timolol neurontin and cymbalta and my migraines have reduced in number and then this helps when i get them and the shot works after youve had the migraine for a while you dont have to take it at the first sign to get relief,"migraine, pain",1
664,i have suffered from migraines since i was 16 and been put on several different medications right now i have been taking topamax for over 4 yrs and it has gotten to where it isnt working anymore so my doctor gave me imitrex injections and they work wonders in getting rid of my headaches but the pain in my chest like something is reaching inside my chest and squeezing the life out of me and the heaviness and tingling sensations lasts for about 1520 mins,pain,1
665,i first experienced cluster headaches at age 18 in the spring several times a day for about a month just suffered through with otc pain meds which did nothing finally got to see a neurologist in my 30s who was awesome diagnosed as classic cluster headache got on verapamil prophilaxis 80mg x3day which i take when shadows start coming also oxygen 1012lmin for aborting attack this has been working but if start oxygen too late then attack progresses i tried sumatriptan injection for the first time when oxygen failed and attack was in full swing tried sumatryptan injection 6mg scamazing all symptoms were gone within 10minutes i will keep trying the oxygen but will definitely use sumatryptan as backup,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1
666,imitrex has been a life saver for me as soon as i feel the headache coming i can take half of a 100mg imitrex and in 20 min the headache subsides i have absolutely no side effects from this medication,headache,1
667,i tried it today cause ive been getting really bad migraines and i tried it expecting it to work but instead i got bad side effects neck is tighten and i also have a severe migraine really disappointed and going to speak to my doctor about finding me something else never taking it again,migraine,1
668,ive suffer from cluster migraine on and off for 10 years they last about 13 hours everyday for 3040 day and this happens usually once sometimes twice a year when they first started doctors really didnt tell me much they about then 5 years ago i seen a new doctor he prescribe me sumatriptan nasal spray it get rid of them in 1020 min i can not say enough good things about this drug its really helped he get on with everyday life,migraine,1
669,i have used sumatriptan injections for at least 4 years i suffer from chronic migraine and occasional cluster headaches if caught early the injections work well they are especially good if you are physically sick during a migraine and cannot keep oral medication down i find them unpleasant to take and my headache intensifies for several minutes after administration now that i have been on them for so long they arent as effective as they were and the headache usually dulls rather than disappears i also often have to take two for the same migraine i havent found anything else that works as well however i am lucky living in scotland where prescriptions are free but am aware these injections can be expensive,"headache, migraine",1
670,i have been suffering from migraines for over 20 years my migraines are hormonal but also stress related first time i took sumatriptan i couldnt believe how effective it was my migraine disappeared in only 15 minutes and i was able to live my life as a normal person instead of lying on bed all day unfortunately the magic only lasted a few times i realised every time i had a migraine it took longer and longer for the drug to act and also my migraines were more frequent since i began using sumatriptan i stopped taking this triptan and my doctor suggested another one zolmitriptan which is working really well for me and i only have 1 migraine per month now,"migraine, stress",1
671,i started getting migraines when i went on birth control in high school about 310 a year which completely debilitated me im 26 now and despite having told past physicians that otc meds did nothing to quell them i was only prescribed this about a month ago i had my first migraine since being prescribed just today and i have to tell you i am so grateful for this medicine despite the directions saying to take it when you felt the headache i went ahead and took it at the close of my aura when i usually would take my excedrin after about 30 minutes i noticed the pain was receding but i decided to nap a little to make sure i wasnt imagining it i woke up after my 30 minute nap but was immediately sick and had to run to the bathroom i normally experience severe nausea with my migraines so i was afraid it hadnt worked but felt extraordinarily migraine free i would give it a full 10 if not for the vomiting but that side effect is so worth it,"aura, headache, migraine, nausea, pain, vomiting",1
672,i started sumatriptan about a month ago my first time the headache didnt necessarily go away but it stopped it from getting bigger it also helped it last only 2 days instead of my normal 3 day migraine the second time was actually horrible i felt like i was drugged dizzy nausea chest pain fingers and arms felt numb etc my heart was beating out of control and it knocked me out for a good 6 hours when i woke up the headache was gone but then a small one came back about 30 min later so that has been my experience the last couple of times taking it im extremely scared to take it on days i have work because the symptoms are super unpredictable ill be trying it a couple more times but i definitely have mixed reviews,"chest pain, headache, migraine, nausea, pain",1
673,i cant believe all the great ratings for this maybe my skin is just extremely sensitive but this was the most painful injection ive ever had in my entire life i choose though over belly and i actually screamed so loudly im sure i scared everyone in the reception area i was not at all prepared for it to hurt as much as it did the unexpected sharp pain only made my headache worse and even paired with a shot of demerol my headache did not clear,"headache, pain",1
674,before taking the medication i had debilitating headaches which are horrible to begin with but adding 3 kids under the age of 6 its a nightmare ever since i began taking them im function again within 3040 mins life saver,nightmare,1
675,i took sumatriptan once last month and it was the worst experience ive ever had it did not get rid of my migraine at all and on top of a raging migraine i felt shaky anxious had chest pain i had a hard time breathing right had tingling sensations in my fingers felt incredibly weak hot nauseas and had diarrhea i tried to eat something to see if that would help but i had such a hard time swallowing it was just awful,"chest pain, migraine, pain",1
676,i have been a cluster headache suffer for 25 yearsmy dad suffers as welli remember him sitting in a chair day after day night after night with no real relief i never could understand or know how intense the attacks were until i started with minelucky my dad was prescribed imitrex in the 90s at the beginning of mine his words and mine are that this drug is a god send for us suffersmy issue is now my insurance company will only approve 2 boxes of shots 4 per month so my only way is to stock pile these 2 boxes every month until my next attackwell im out and now i wiil use coupons or any other way to purchase these on my own to try to save sad uhc will not approve the number of shots needed for each episode,"cluster headache, headache",1
677,im 54 years old and have used imitrex for almost 20 years no side effects except leg pain for about 24 hours as if i overused in a workout was on 100 mg tabs for a long time with 3 mg selfinjections as necessary now just taking 50 mg as i get fewer and less intense headaches now this medicine is worth trying but ask for ekg first if the doctor doesnt order it this can help check for heart okay first,"leg pain, pain",1
678,imitrex is the best medication for migraines i have taken so far when i first started using it i would get the loopy feeling and slight dizziness normal right but after a month or two and a few more uses of this medication i started get a burning sensation in my head behind my eyes and progressively got worse with each time i took it the side effects have gotten so bad that now i get coldhot sweats the burning sensation in my head and vomiting i have now switched to a medication that is the prescription strength of motrin which works just as well,"burning sensation, dizziness, vomiting",1
679,ive been a migraine sufferer since i was 10 years old my dr prescribed sumatriptan 2 years ago and honestly now i cant live without it i take one tablet and within 20 mins the migraine is completely gone side effects for me are hot flushes for a few hrs and i have really achy heavy joints the next day anybody else get these side effects,migraine,1
680,so far this medications does help but it makes me very sleepy generally when i get a bad migraine its debilitating i usually leave work and in bed for the rest of the day so far ive taken this medication twice and it helps rid the migraine andor lessens it to a dull headache then i need to rest stay hydrated no lights noise or strong smells,"headache, migraine",1
681,i am 25 years old and have been getting migraines since my early teens i get 2 or 3 per month lasting up to 3 days at a time this is the first prescription drug ive tried for them and i think the good might barely outweigh the bad my headache is typically gone within an hour but i experience some pretty awful side effects my shoulders arms and legs get very weak similar to flu cramps weakness my tongue gets very heavy and its hard to speak the nausea is sometimes worse than it is when i have a migraine without medication and i get very drowsy for a few hours after taking it unfortunately when untreated my migraines have lasted multiple days the fact that the headache is gone so quickly is the only reason i havent given up on this,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
682,this medicine has changed my life it is a 100 surefire defense against debilitating migraines i can actually feel it pushing the headache out of my head one word of caution however in the rare instance i feel a headache coming on and dont have my meds with me or more likely am out of them since the insurance allows only a 9pill script the headache that i do get is off the charts its almost like the migraine monster knows i have no defense,"headache, migraine",1
683,ive been suffering with migraine for 40 years tried everything on the market including acupuncture used imitrex needle injections for many years learned about sumavel dosepro a few years ago loved this script very good success with it however in the past few months i have had 12 injections not fire off 15 or 20 minutes after my attempts the cartridges fired off on my counter some never fired off and the medicine remained in the injector i contacted endo and they were helpful took the information and sent a postage paid envelope to return the defective injections to some lab in california endo forwarded info to my insurance company for replacements surprise im still waiting for these replacements getting nowhere,migraine,1
684,ive had headaches seemingly every day since puberty i just turned 45 normally the headaches are very low grade and tolerable last year they became debilitating i described my headaches and was asked if i was ever told i have migraines nope lol sigh the dr first tried a blocker two shots to the back of my head i slept for 16 hours a day for a month and it didnt do a thing for my headaches then i was placed on sumatriptan succinate 50mg when required i was surprised when i found myself with an abundance of energy which has since dropped a lot but it doesnt knock me out as others have complained my problem now is with insurance they only approved 18 pills for a month i told my dr so he increased the mg to 100 and told me to break it in half when i picked them up i was only approved for 9 what the heck,puberty,1
685,i tried sumavel dosepro for the first time approximately 3 months ago it does take away about 8090 of the headache pain but am left with a sinus feeling headache that really hurts when i cough sneeze or bend over which is typical for me for a day after a migraine the injection sting feels a little like being snapped by a rubber band it didnt feel extremely painful to me i do get a fairly intense burning sensation mostly along my scalp but to a lesser degree across the surface of my skin as well my arms feel very heavy and it was frightening at first my biggest problem is that i get intensely sleepy and for about 20 minutes i feel like im operating in slow motion,"burning sensation, cough, headache, migraine, pain",1
686,finally something nonaddictive that actually treats my migraines i take this with an aleve and i usually get relief within an hour and the relief lasts a few hours about 8 only downside is that it makes you really drowsy and it makes you feel like blah for a few days after you take it but its totally worth it in my opinion also i feel safe taking it since its the only option my doctor had that doesnt have any warning about possible addiction,,0
687,ive had migraines as young as 11 years old it was horrible every time i got one i was too young to understand that it was a migraine at last when i was 17 years old i began reading more about migraines and knew that i had them the first time ever taking sumatriptan succinate i felt so relieved and almost migraine free sometimes i feel tenderness in my jaw and neck but after 30 mins i feel great,"migraine, tenderness",1
688,i have had migraines since my late teens i used to take fiornal but discovered imitrex which has been a life saver i get migraines with aura followed by pain i use the nasal imitrex and i find that if i take imitrex at the onset of my vision loss i am usually able to stop the vision problem as well as stop the migraine within 30 minutes this medication has been a lifesaver for me the only side effect with the nasal spray for me is that it tastes horrible in the back of my throat and it makes me a bit sickly feeling but all in all id rather have it than not,"aura, migraine, pain",1
689,imitrex is a wonderful medication i have had hormonerelated migraines for a few years now and while nsaids would shorten them they wouldnt eliminate them completely i only had to take a 25 mg imitrex pill and rest for a little bit and my headache was gone within an hour or so the only side effects i may have experienced were a slight ache around my forehead and jaw as the headache was fading and a little bit of feeling out there though these feelings could have been due to the migraine itself overall i would highly recommend this medication and am very grateful to its makers,"ache, headache, migraine",1
690,have cluster headaches for 20 years starting in my late 40s longest period 18 months one a day and longest period without as nov 2019 to nov 2020 then boom back again to this day now take verapamil 3 times day and when cluster comes on use imitrex nasal sprayquickly reduces pain level and generally headaches gone in about 15 to 20 minuteslucky that between my insurance and provincial govt cost is covereddefinitely recommend trying,pain,1
691,17 year migrainer hands down this is the best overall migraine abortive i have used for over 1 year and 90 of the time it takes 85 of the migraine away biggest plus is no needle the sensation feels like a rubber band snap my other abortive is treximet 85500 and topamax 100mg daily for preventative,migraine,1
692,thank god for imitrex the first tablet i took stopped the headache and didnt have any side effects the first time the next time i took it i felt shaky the only side effect that i get from imitrex is jaw pain but at least my migraines are no longer in my back just make sure that if you are needing two 100mg tablets a day for several days in a row and you still arent getting relief consider a preventive or have a backup i dont have nearly as many headaches anymore,"headache, pain",1
693,the medication itself works which is the only positive thing i can say this needleless injection is so much more painful than any needle ive ever experienced ill be going back to real injections my leg is still throbbing in pain 30 minutes later and it took over 5 minutes to stop the bleeding ive never had pain or bleeding with an imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle who would choose this,pain,1
694,my 1st migraine experience at 10yrs old landed me in the emergency room finally in my 30s after decades of wasted time pain frustration i was introduced to imitrex injections i call this the miracle drug im fortunate to have medical coverage the weather mainly affects my migraines i also work a stressful job with shift work im now 44 and although i still attempt prevention and alternative methods nothing cures my migraines except the injections,"frustration, migraine, pain",1
695,this does wonders although at rare times it doesnt do much so i have to add an advil or double dose it i take 50mg so i take another to make 100mg i use it mostly for my migraines during that time of the month i shouldnt say this either but it works for migraines induced by hangovers tooonce in a blue moon when i been drinking at a wedding etc works in 30 minutes tops pain goes away but my face and body often feel heavy and stiff but i found out its a common side effect so overall a good migraine solution,"migraine, pain",1
696,this medicine works great for my migraine headaches i experience drowsiness and a heaviness or tightness in my head and neck but on minimally my headaches are usually gone within an hour or two sometimes the drowsiness is nice because it helps me sleep through the pain i would definitely recommend this product,"drowsiness, migraine, pain",1
697,i had migraines years ago and they were debilitating i had to be alone in a dark room i had trouble remembering my own name it was as if i had had a stoke eventually i seem to have outgrown them i suspect some people label bad headaches migraines when they arent my wife has cfs and has serious real migraines about once a week imitrex is nothing short of a miracle medication for her nothing else helps the main negative is the cost about 250 for a box of about six nasal sprayers she will use four to defeat one headache insurance only pays for two boxes a month and she needs at least three with copays we end up spending about 300 a month on imitrex ,headache,1
698,i have to take sumatriptan for my cluster headache but wish i didnt the side effects are horrendous i have to take it in bed otherwise id never be strong enough to get into bed as soon as i take the injection i start having chest pains and pounding on my chest then i get complete weakness of legs and arms and start feeling tightness of my hands i feel like i will throw up and go all sweaty the only thing i can do is try to sleep straight away so i sleep through the symptoms while people keep checking on me the thing is with all these horrendous side effects its still a million times worth it to stop the pain of a cluster headache so have to take them just be very careful and make sure someone is with you when you take them if the symptoms are too bad go straight to the doctors or a e,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1
699,i have suffered from migraine since my early 20s i am now 50 years old and for the past year have suffered from daily migraine with very limited effect from botox therapy i saw the ad for this new patch having been on everything in the migraine market and asked my specialists to try it it looks invasive but was easy to use i activated the red led button after making sure it was sealed good to my arm my doctor said i would have prickliness at first but i didnt experience that every time and when i did it would only last about 10 minutes i did get the redness but that was my only side effect and it faded daily but took about a week to completely disappear i had no migraine within 30 minutes and no hang over,"migraine, redness",1
700,ive been experiencing migraines ever since i was around 14 or 15 when i went on birth control they started getting a little better except for when i was either really stressed or on my period both times when they are really bad i talked to my doctor about it and she put me on imatrex which i tried for the first time when i was 15 when my sister took it and it works wonders it alleviates the headache in about 3045 minutes the thing ive noticed that is its best when you first start to feel a migraine coming on not when youre migraine is already unbearable ive also experienced some minor side affects like drowsiness and some minor stomach pains usually only if i take it on an empty stomach but other than that ive had no issue,"drowsiness, headache, migraine",1
701,i started experiencing severe gut wrenching migraines out of no where jan 2 2018 as if a catastrophic storm had arrived in my head 9 months later still here no infections or inflammation but where after pulling myself off of steroids advil became my new friend after 30 minalleviated all i had to do was hold on neurologists here i come i was given 2 choices in which was indomethacin and sumatriptan 50mg tablets 9 as much as my headaches agonize i am scared of the side affects to be frank stroke heart attack andor symptoms i ended up taking the indomethacin it is 2 to 3 steps higher than advil but less riskier i reach for the sumatriptan box but at the last minute i pull away heres to something else coming along my path that wont give me such horrendous side effects until then its the indomethacin and my friend advil,inflammation,1
702,while it did make the pain stop it didnt help the other symptoms i have it also left a dull aching pressure in my face made my chest hurt and my hair felt as though it was being pulled i found out later it is not supposed to be used by people whove had atypical migraines which ive had,pain,1
703,i have been using this for years for my migraines i was on the lower dose until the last 6 months my dosage was increased because the lower dose quit working for me i would have to take one wait 2 hours then take a 2nd one and most of the time i ended up in the er for a migraine cocktail because it wouldnt go away anyway after my dosage was increased it worked for me again i do not have any side effects at all and it does not make me loopy or tired i can get back to my day within about 3045 minutes after taking it i would recommend it,migraine,1
704,i love this medicine the only caveat the difficulty in filling the actual prescription i have all the side effects you have all mentioned but as everyone said well worth it im a teacher and in my last two weeks of school i need the insurance issues to clear up so i can pick up the rest of my medicines,,0
705,ive had clusters for as long as i can remember but theyve gotten worse as ive gotten older first doc prescribed frova which didnt help at all but the most recent doctor ive seen prescribed sumatriptan i cant believe how quickly this worked my headaches usually lasted 3 hours even after taking 34 aleve sumatriptan has knocked them out in 15 minutes i feel a bit jittery after and have extreme taste sensitivity for a few hours but its well worth it this medicine is a miracle,,0
706,i take the generic sumatriptan this medicine has changed my life i honestly cant see how i would make it through my days if i didnt have this medicine when a migraine comes along i get migraines 34 times a week taking it does have side effects as most of the time my arms get heavy and tingly i suggest taking it and then sleeping an hour while it kicks in but sometimes that is not possible and you just have to push through it to me its worth it and definitely worth trying,migraine,1
707,every time i take this medicine my throat and neck become so tense and sore i also feel tired and loopy it does make the migraine better currently trying to decide if its worth the side effects or not,migraine,1
708,because my migraines start while i am asleep i do not get the lights prior to onset i start by having ringing in my ears around 11 pm then around 230 am the pain starts if i take a shot at that time i can function during the day if not around 4 to 5 am i awake with a fullblown blindinoneeye migraine and i cannot function for about 12 hours later it feels like someone took a baseball bat to my head and it hurts,"migraine, pain",1
709,i have had migraines since i was 6 years old they are very strong in my family i have been using the imitrex injections since i was 17 i am now 25 i am always amazed at how well the imitrex works because i get migraines so often i usually wait until my migraine is pretty bad before taking an injection you are supposed to take it at the first sign of a migraine but if i did that i would take an injection almost daily i take the injection lie down for 3060 minuted and the migraine is totally gone seriously the only side effects i have are a tinglytight feeling that lasts 23 minutes and as of the last 3 years a red itchy injection site reaction that resolves in 2 hours or less,"injection site reaction, migraine",1
710,i use imitrex at the start of my aura which is usually 20 minutes long and once the aura is gone the headache hits me i add a vicodin pill with the imitrex and usually lay down when and where i can it seems to work for me the only side effects i have are a stiff neck and upper back and grogginess for a day or two i keep imitrex in my car at work the boat and my golf bag,"aura, headache",1
711,this is the only rx that will get rid of my migraines thus far but it has painful side effects i stumbled across the antioxidant drink called ba justin timberlake and christopher walken do a commercial for it and it literally takes away the side effects so im not in pain or knocked our for the 4 hours it takes to get through my system you take the pill with the ba and slowly sip on it as soon as you feel an ache take another drink i have no idea why it works but it does ,"ache, pain",1
712,if you can stand the burning sensation then its all worth it its the only thing that helps my migraines i used to get them for days on end and i dont get them so often anymore i also add a trip to the chiropractor as well,burning sensation,1
713,i have used imitrex by autoinjection since it first came out after years of migraine taking my day away this tiny injection allows me to take it back unlike the other medicines i take this at first onset and 3035 min later continue my day on schedule no nap no regrets no nausea after initial prescription met with the manufacturers rep who helped with dosing i was pioneering any new products when this came out wegmans pharmacist and my md and the drug rep were great help now 2 shots 1 in each leg right away im 220 lbs,"migraine, nausea",1
714,my experience with generic imitrex has been bad it sometimes works sort of but a day or so after i have debilitating muscle aches it took me a while to make the association but once i switched back to the real medication that problem went away,,0
715,this worked really well ive taken the pills and they dont do anything for my chronic migraines i did experience some mild tingling in my limbs a few minutes after and a weird warm flushing feeling in my chest the warm flushing feeling in my chest came almost immediately after the injection it didnt last long and my heartbeat was normal at least it felt normal minor pain at injection site but no biggie overall this little pen saved my work day and killed what usually would be a 2448hr migraine and ordeal,"flushing, migraine, pain",1
716,i have used both the pill and the injection form of imitrex and they are both amazing the first time i was given a shot was in the walkin clinic the first time i had a migraine after a very weird initial sensation of kind of a buzz i could actually feel the headache dissipating the pill form works just as well but like some other reviewers stated it does work best if you can lay down for a while,"headache, migraine",1
717,im 18 and my doctor prescribed me this because i suffer from constant headachesmigraines this has the worst side effects which made my body ache it hurt when i yawned and i felt so much pressure on my chest my head was still pounding 2 hours after taking it i wont be taking these again,ache,1
718,i have had headaches for years and i could not find any medication that would work for me the doctor put me on imitrex 50mg and it works great i get headaches about 4 days a month in the winter but i have huge increase in the summer normal for migraine suffers about 14 days it does have some side effects for me but the benefit is greater than the side effects i am also on antidepressants and high blood pressure medicine to see if it will lessen my pain this is a newer treatment and most doctors say that they see an improvement in migraine suffers headaches less headachesless pain,"migraine, pain",1
719,pill form did not work for me but the statdose stops the pain within twenty mins most times side effects are tightness in chest weakness in arms but this goes away within an hour or so better than that little devil with the big hammer beating the inside of my head i take it as soon as i feel that i am getting a migraine and not just a common headache i try not to overuse it as i have a fear it will stop working and it is the only thing that works short of an er visit for demerol,"fear, headache, migraine, pain",1
720,imitrex has been a life saver for me i keep a few tablets with me at all times imitrex relieves my headaches 100 of the time it relives my migraines but it also works on all the other types of headaches too at least for me it does i usually only need one 50mg tablet but on a rare occasion i will have to take a second tablet 30 to 60 minutes after the first to get relief i dont know what id do without this medicine i guess im one of the lucky ones because i suffer no side effects at all when taking imitrex,,0
721,i have been a long time sufferer of migraines for 21 years on my life and i am 40 so half of my life i have been on many many daily meds and meds to take to help with the pain to heavy narcotics this is the only inject able that helps with my migraines i try my normal thing of ib profin and a benadryl and if that does not work after a few hours i use sumavel dosepro and with in 10 minutes 90 of the time i am migraine free and ready to go though my day this works for onsets to walking up with a full blown migraine,"migraine, pain",1
722,imitrex injection has worked well for me for the past several years but sometimes it doesnt last more than 34 hours and i need a second injection pills dont work as well nasal spray doesnt work at all for me the only side effects i have are flushing with sweating and some drowsiness im just glad to have it as i get a few migraines a month i definitely recommend it,"drowsiness, flushing, sweating",1
723,injection works in 710 minutes and you can have your life back only thing i dont like is the 710 minutes hot flashes that can soak your clothing make your pain a 1000 times more intense just wait it out no more pain no more loud noises no more bright lights i do not like the pill takes too long,pain,1
724,im a male aged 24 i have recently started using the nasal spray suminat containing the drug sumatriptan it has done wonders to me i have had no side effects till now and my migraine goes away for months after taking 12 doses i have been suggested to take 1 metered spray in each nostril on onset of headache my history since 2003 till 2007 i have tried disprin med containing diclofenac sodium vasograinworst tablet voveran tablet voveran injection on hipinstant relief but my migraine got resistant to these with time i strongly recommend to try the drug sumatriptan,"headache, migraine",1
725,i have been a sufferer from what was thought to be very bad headache attacks but as i later began to doubt this i was told by my gp that my headaches could actually be migraine attacks i was given sumatriptan tablets to see if this would help in combating the onset of my headaches and stop them all together and not just preventing a headache from developing into a migraine i used to suffer from full blown migraines from time to time once or twice a month and less severe attacks in between now as soon as i begin to feel any kind of eye or neck strain or light sensitivity i know am going to be okay ask your gp about sumatriptan medication highly recommended,"headache, migraine",1
726,i was recently prescribed imigran the european version of imitrex for acute cluster headache in the injection form pretty much life changing id previously tried oral sumatriptan for cluster headaches but that just did not seem effective and once a full blown attack had started the pill did not seem to abort the headache injectable sumatriptan though has proved to be a totally different thing and even when the pain is at its peak once injected its probably 10 minutes maximum before the headache is gone totally gone ive suffered from cluster headaches for many years and only wish id tried this sooner for me it has been just brilliant having used it several times now have not had any side effects whatsoever fantastic,"cluster headache, headache, pain",1
727,i was at work with a migraine and eventually had to leave because i couldnt even do much of anything i just took an imitrex about 1015 minutes ago and already the results are starting to show great stuff the only bad part is that i have to go back into work and finish the shift i had started,migraine,1
728,im concerned because the migraines do not react to this medication mostly i usually have to follow it up once the main part of the pain is gone with an over the counter migraine medicine i am concerned as another patient said if takin to many of them even though the pain is intense because your body gets use to them,"migraine, pain",1
729,ive suffered from cluster headaches for the last 3 years since i was diagnosed with a growth on my pineal gland nothing worked until i was put under neurology science in york uk i was put on verapamil tablets and also prednisolone to prevent and sumatriptan as a pain relief when i have an attack i was close to drilling a hole on the side of my head before i was prescribed these meds the problem is they are expensive i am lucky and i have these prescribed under the nhs however they will not prescribe me more than 4 injections per week and sometimes i have these attaches every day sown times twice a day for 2 to 3 weeks sumitriptan is the best thing ever invented,pain,1
730,im 21 years old and have unfortunately inherited my familys notorious migraine genes ive suffered from migraines from a very young age the 1st medicine i was given at age 21 being finally officially diagnosed by military doctors while being deployed to iraq was zomig dissolving tablets no luck second was imitrex tablets same thing nothing except side effects then i was tried on statdose imitrex still nothing the only thing thats helped with killing my migraines is an er visit being treated with fluids valium to knock me out and dilaudid or morphine along with phenergran,migraine,1
731,i have been on this medication for over 5 years i rated it 9 stars because it did work well to stop my migraine in its tracks within an hour i would only take half at a time due to side affects of fatigue and dizziness however my body became dependent upon it a few years into starting sumatriptan i began experiencing almost daily rebound headachesmigraines for several years i struggled with changing diet eliminating caffeine foods other triggers and taking all the preventative meds on the market to no avail recently i saw my md instead of the nurse practitioner he advised me that triptans can cause rebounds for some people he changed my meds after a week i was back to my usual 1 or 2 migraines a week,"dizziness, fatigue, migraine",1
732,i find with this if i catch the migraine by the kaleidoscope stage or missing vision at the earlier stagethen after half hour lie down i can still manag to drive home etc after effects of sore eyes etc is significantly lessened 50mg for me,migraine,1
733,as a disabled veteran with chronic post traumatic stress disorder i have migraines 4 or 5 days a week for years now the va refuses to treat my severe pain properly the va will only give me nine pills a month which is not enough the va pharmacist told me it is because the medicine is too expensive none of the codeine medicines work after eight years with migraines sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me what is wrong with the va staff they do not care if i am in severe pain,"pain, stress",1
734,i take 100mg pill when the feeling of a migraine is coming on and this stops the migraine from getting worse within 30 minutes it would take up to 2 hours for the migraine to be completely gone i have recently switched to the 25mg nasal spray and found this to be even more effective taken on the onset it stopped the migraine from getting worse within a few minutes and gone in under 1 hour i have not experienced any side affects either the only negative thing i would say is not about the drug but how it is dispensed i am only allowed 9 doses a month and some months i have a need for more than this,migraine,1
735,truly awful experience ive been nervous about using this medication but ive taken too much time off of work for migraines so i took a pill this morning before leaving the house by the time i got to work my sinuses and throat were both sore then i got lightheaded dizzy and my chest and throat tightened up like i couldnt breathe i had to go lie down praying the side effects would lighten up two hours later i am now enjoying stiffness in my shoulders and muscle aches throughout my hips and legs on top of everything else sorry but never ever again,stiffness,1

737,i have been having chronic cluster headaches for the last 15 years i have at least two per day and as many as 5 then for some crazy reason during my anniversary month they go up to 9 or 10 i have taken everything under the sun recently prescribed the injection pack it is the most successful med ive tried but heres the draw back i can only take two shots per day so what do i do for the rest of my migraines my doc painted a bad pic of taking to many shots this drug is a tease why cant someone make this so i can take 4 or 5 a day please,,0
738,after years of sick headaches that nothing touched my dr prescribed sumatriptan 100mg i resisted taking it until a couple of weeks ago when i finally couldnt stand my headache any longer it made me very nauseous for about an hour then the nausea my headache were gone this morning i had to take it again this time i was nauseous for about 1 12 hours my whole face was sore i dont know if it is worth it even if it does get rid of the migraine,"headache, migraine, nausea",1
739,the medication side effects just added to my migraine symptoms making it an even worse experience and didnt even relieve me of the migraine for more than a few hours if even that when i couldnt stand it anymore and asked for a new medication i was given rizatriptan which didnt have as bad of side effects but still didnt relieve my migraine in the slightest i also feel my migraine frequency went up during this time but that might have been a coincidence,migraine,1
740,i was on both fioricet and this medication in small injection form for almost 15 years worked well especially since i get the works upon the start of a migraine everything from aura to loss of arm and hand motor function to slurred speech almost identical to a stroke that clears up after 24 to 48 hours only down side was the tightening of the neck and jaw muscles but other than that it did shorten the migraine length and severity now move 10 years later and was dropped off the imitrex and ended up in the hospital from a car accident and began a severe migraine and was given an imitrex inhaler and i ended up with bad chest pains and was told to never tried it again,"accident, aura, migraine, slurred speech",1
741,i have been getting menstrual migraines and food triggered ones rarely for maybe 10 years i am 42 usually 24 a month if i take sumatriptan in the beginning when pain has started it works within 15 min and pain is gone i wish i had tried it sooner it does make you a little drowsy and occasionally sweat or feel tightness in your neck also a diuretic take with food and lots of water,pain,1
742,i have had migraines since the age of 6 i have tried everything i unfortunately need pain medication about 10 of the time i sure wish i would have had these injections years ago they works most of the time i have very severe pain and nausea and it does help,"nausea, pain",1

744,i have used zomig 5mg for years and often one half of a tablet zaps the headache within 15 minutes without any side effects at all since becoming eligible for medicare my prescription plan has forced me to use the generic sumatriptan sumatriptan does not work at all for me i wish i could afford to take my zomig again it is a wonder drug,headache,1
745,the medication was amazing i loved how quickly it worked for my migraines i get too many a month to use zecuity exclusively so i saved it for the bad nausea ones unfortunately the second time i used it the patch burned a hole in my leg when i called to report it the company insisted it was just an allergic reaction i literally had a chunk of skin missing and i still have a scar several months later the medication is great but whatever they use to push it through the skin is not good obviously since it has since been recalled disposal of all of the materials is ridiculous i would have driven an hour or two to the nearest speciality pharmacy to not have to deal with the delivery and packaging of the medication,"nausea, scar",1
746,just tried sumatriptan for the first time i got it over the counter in a uk chemist im a 39 yr old man who has suffered from debilitating migraines since a teenager they have become less frequent with age but when i get the early signs aurora it still sends me into panic of whats to come lying helplessly in hell for hours so when i heard of a new effective drug i jumped at the chance and this was my experience you get two pills i took one with water and laid down in a dark room after about 40 mins i could feel the drug starting to take effect it was if the migraine was still happening but it had been dulled down or masked by the drug you feel tired sick and a bit bit weird but its better than the migraine pain,"migraine, pain",1
747,sumatriptan nasal spray 15 years sufferer 35 y old only got sumatriptan lately and its working well headaches would last 90 mins to 3 hrs now with the nasal spray 20 mins and its completely gone dont leave home without it now,,0

749,review for sumatriptan succinate injection generic imitrex i was so impressed i was getting too wordy with the review and it cut me off so ill get to the point after taking the medication through injection the pill is so slow to work for me my aura was gone in less than 2 minutes and i was able to continue teaching my students throughout the remainder of the school day i still had a headache and minor side effects like hot flashes tension in my shoulders and obviously pain at injection site but i will take those things over a days long migraine any day i am so impressed with this medication all symptoms were totally gone without even a minute headache by 8pm that evening,"aura, headache, migraine, pain, tension",1
750,this is a miracle medicine for me and is most effective when taken at the onset of a migraine within 20 minutes i can feel the relief setting in within an hour i have no sign of a headache or the usual symptoms of vomiting blurred vision ringing in the ears etc if i deny that i feel a migraine coming on and take the pill after the headache has progressed it takes a little longer for the pill to work before this medicine i had become a prisoner in my own life not daring to venture far from home thank you imitrex for giving me back my life,"headache, migraine, vomiting",1
751,sumatriptan tablet is very good within half an hour there a big difference i take it with 2 pain killers and it works wonders cupping it very good for migraines i know a few people that have done cupping on there head n migraines the have gone,pain,1
752,i recently was diagnosed with complex migraine i feel like i am having some kind of seizure that i am awake for numbness and facial twitching slurred speech ocular pain and all kinds of bizarre visuals sumatriptan definitely takes the edge off it only works if i am already having a severe migraine though and takes some time to work as well in addition i cannot take this medicine if i am at work because it makes me rather tired however it is quite helpful for when i am at home and does significantly reduce the disorienting pain and eye pressure it does not make aura disappear but it makes it less bright not perfect but pretty good,"aura, migraine, numbness, pain, slurred speech",1
753,this was hugely helpful for me when my doctor figured out that i was suffering from migraines once in a while i get sick to my stomach before the medication takes effect especially if ive delayed taking it for whatever reason but i cant describe how much better it is to have this than to suffer if i lose a dose to emesis ill take another with a small amount of water and wait for everything to calm down keeps me functional where before id have been wiped out and wishing for death for a day or more side effects for me have been very mild and occasional slight tingly feelings or a little bit of mental distance from my surroundings words cant describe how much better this is than torture,death,1
754,it truly works for me and im grateful for it sometimes i need the second dose it really depends on how soon i take the med when i feel a migraine coming on the only side effects ive ever noticed is i may get a sore neck or an upset stomach if taken on an empty stomach but thats nothing compared to a migraine i usually just take some pepto and drink gatorade and that helps,"migraine, upset stomach",1
755,this is the first time iive gotten a migraine and i contacted my doctor and he gave me sumatriptan the pill its impossible this pill has intensified my migraines to the point were im shaking and i am so dizzy i can not function i am so nauseous its just all bad i just feel so dead its honestly the worst experience ive ever had with a medication ever not to mention im so nauseated ive never felt this terribly in my entire life never again ,migraine,1
756,started with imitrex when it first came out with the big bulky injector kits then got the statdose kit two syringes in one cartridges that fit in a case with reusable injector pen injections for bad migraines tablets if i catch them soon enough ,,0
757,given this drug to my mother 44 after an hour taking 50mg she admitted 70 to 80 relieve in her migraine but weakness whole day long but after two days symptoms reappeared so now giving her tricyclic antidepressant 10 mg at bed time only for a month now she feels better,migraine,1
758,suffering with migraines for years but only once a month or so i was so scared to take this medicine due to the reviews as i am sensitive to medication however it did actually work within half an hour and i didnt feel any major side effects apart from just feeling slightly different within myself but nothing crazy,,0
759,this is the only medication that will get rid of my cluster headaches its so effective ive only used the nasal spray so far but am starting pills since i was having trouble getting authorization for the spray its a godsend really these headaches make me want to opt out of the entire universe,,0
760,the worse it did nothing for the migraines even with two instead i got every side effect possible and it was worse when i found myself having to hold on to my chest when i started feeling pain i couldnt even breathe and was freaking out once i stopped it all got better everyone is different so we all need to experience bad ones before we get one thats right for us,pain,1
761,i have suffered from migraines since i was 12 i am 53 sumavil dosepro is the only medication that works for me although i used to have frequent migraines several per month sometimes multiple per week my migraines are less frequent now my migraines do not respond well to other medications sumavel taken appropriately has changed my life migraines no longer dictate my schedule however this calendar year my insurance stopped covering sumavel and the company does not offer an assistance program i am down to 4 shots not sure what ill do after that,,0
762,i have frequent migraine for 40 years i have been using sumatriptan for now 8 years sadly i noticed that in the morning following a tablet or 2 6 hours in between my head is shaking or swingin which is alarming my all family and myself look like i have to found an alternative to the sumatriptan still thanks to it for all the relief it gives me,migraine,1
763,i take the injectable form of this medication for soul crushing cluster headaches and i must say it is an absolute miracle to go from 2 hours of crippling pain to 10 minutes is such an incredible blessing truly this medication is a godsend,pain,1
764,just started having migraines at 45 gee wonder why lol tried all the otc and homeopathic treatment i could find gave up and started with relpax my insurance wouldnt help so it was 115 for 6 then my dr had me try 50 mg sumpitriptan generic imitrex and very inexpensive always works within an hour and normally my migraines last 36 hours on any otc med i cant take more than 2 doses in a 5 day stretch or im up for days with leg cramps tho in desperation ive started topomax 50 mg as preventative but its about 20 effective and not worth the side effects for me lack of focus numbness tired,numbness,1
765,i have had sumatriptan for the last 10 years 100mg taken immediately you experience the aura wait half an hour you wouldnt know youve had a migraine my life line a relative also uses sumatriptan swears by the drug 50 mg is too low a dose,"aura, migraine",1
766,id taken excedrin for years wsome effectiveness then had a streak where headaches would return within a day and sought medical attention an urgent care doctor prescribed bubalbitalapapcaffeine and i used it as needed for about a year and was happy with the results but the prescription was running out because the medication was prescribed by an urgent care doctor the prescription couldnt be refilled so i had to see an internal medicine doctor and he prescribed sumatriptan after taking the medicine today it did eventually take away my visual auras and it seems to block the full on migraine but i feel kind of crummy with sinus drainage and pressure grogginess and slight nausea going to try wpain reliever naproxen,"migraine, nausea",1
767,definitely use this drug with caution if you are someone who tends to have sensitivities to drugs and often experience side effects from things be wary of this one my side effects were much worse than the headache itself i had horrible muscle aches in neck and head for 2 hours and then threw up violently even though the headache was gone please ask your doctor about alternative options to this,headache,1
768,i have chronic daily headaches with 5 day intermittent migraines i am currently unable to work i saw a neurologist and got an mri luckily there is nothing serious mine is muscle spasms in my neck that travel to my head this medication works well and is cheap my doctor days it can cause heart issues and wants me to take a 100 per pill script that my insurance wont cover i moderate my diet and lifestyle use cannabis productslegal in my state and try only to use this drug for extreme headaches i use excedrin and cannabis vape or gummies for muscle tension and moderate headaches also stopped drinking coffee and eating pesticides just saying its holistic dont obsess about stressful things pastfuture it is all related yoga stretching helps too upper back neck and shoulders i like this drug but use it sparingly,"muscle spasms, tension",1
769,i started off using the pills but if my migraine had already made me vomit the pills would not work i have now switched to the injection and highly recommend it i can feel the relief in minutes i feel a little fuzzy and need to lay down right after injection the sleep is much needed and i wake up pain free and no side effects the injection does hurt a little but nothing compared to the pain of a migraine,"migraine, pain",1
770,i get headaches about 3 times a week my doctor diagnosed me having migraine sumatriptan works very well for me my headache is normally gone in 30 minutes and i only take 50 mg as i only way about 150 pounds i usually take it if i am having a headache late in the day or in the middle of the night it seems to help me sleep too my concern with sumatriptan is its effect on my blood vessels heart disease is very prominent in my family so i worry about stroke and heart attack for that reason i do not take it if i have a headache first thing in the morning or early in the day if i have a headache in the morning i take one excedrin for migraine as i do like to work out first thing in the morning it usually works well but not as well as the sumatriptan for me unfortunately excedrin seems to cause rebound headaches probably from the caffeine my bottom line is sumatriptan is my go to medication i am just careful about any strenuous activity after taking it,"headache, migraine, worry",1
771,like several was confused for a while thinking migraines were sinus or ear infections first sign is ear pain for me have gotten worse as i hit 50 and entering perimenopause really struggled with 48 hour long pain vomiting till ob prescribed imitrex like others if i wait too long its benefit isnt as great as when i take it at the first sign i dont know about the rebound headaches as my migraines are so bad my headaches for days later and am foggy for a few days imitrex maybe makes me a little spacey but far more functional than with a migraine and the side effects are shorter than when i have a migraine,"ear pain, migraine, pain, vomiting",1
772,i actually had zero problems with this medication it made me sleepy but i did take it at night when my headache first occurred i also take a low dosage of zoloft not sure if that helped curve side effects as the doctor did tell me it could cause short term 1 hour heart attack symptomsbubble in throat i had hot flashes but i already have them so i cant say sumatriptan was to blame my insurance paid for 9 tablets a month i get 50mg oral,headache,1
773,ive had migraines since my 20s im 63 now imitrex has been a lifesaver for me i take 100mg at the onset of migraine dont wait until its full blown i also use imitrex injection in emergencies like waking up with a 10 migraine and i dont want to wait at least an hour for relief im terrified of needles but the quick relief is worth it plus its an autoinjector you never see the needle just press the button i do notice i feel more side effects than with the pill rebound headaches are very possible if you take it too often i would have missed out on so much life without it,migraine,1

884,i suffered with migraines lasting mostly up to four days per occurance they were so severe id almost wish for death finally my dr put me n sumitriptan and it literally saved my life i believe i try not to focus on the neg side effects because to be rid of the pain is worth it one pill will knock it out within min and i know i can always take the second one for the most severe flare ups i do take it as last resort as i have i very high threshold for pain because this is a dangerous med but when i need it it has never failed my severe pain,"death, pain",1
885,i have had migraine for years y this rx works effectively ,migraine,1
886,i have had migraine headaches since i was a preschooler for as long as i can remember i have suffered with migraine headaches sometimes three to four times per month and each occurence could last up to three days i would be hypersensitive to light and noise my head would ache severely on my left side i would be nauseous and sometimes dizzy and miserable from the feelings of helplessness i struggled through elementary and high school and persevered through the agony tylenol aspirin ibuprofen did nothing to lessen the pain it was after my family doctor tried me on many other alternatives that he suggested sumatriptan i was in my late 20s it was a lifesaver it is the only medication that has taken away my migraines i just turned 60 and although the frequency of my migraine attacks has reduced the intensity remains the same sumatriptan works every time to take the pain and symptoms away i honestly do not know how i could live on today if it were not for sumatriptan the negligible side effects are transient and insignificant compared to the migraine pain from what i understand it does not work on some people who claim to have headaches all i can suggest is that their headaches may not be actual migraines but possibly some other headache that sumatriptan is not designed to treat if it doesnt work for you that doesnt mean that it doesnt work for others it saved my life and my sanity ,"ache, headache, migraine, pain",1

891,this really is a miracle pill my grandpa dad and myself all suffer from the same type of migraines we have aura symptoms our face and body goes numb for about 2030 minutes then the piercing cluster headache pains kick in followed with intense vomiting i took sumatriptan with my last migraine spell and let me tell you i still had a light headache but my numbness vanished and i didnt vomit once i was able to sleep the rest off no crazy side effects either so thankful for these ,"aura, cluster headache, headache, migraine, numbness, vomiting",1
892,within ten minutes of taking this medication i had nausea vomiting and diarrhea the headache went away but it was traded for the above issues,"headache, nausea, vomiting",1
893,i suffer from cluster headaches and migraines i just started taking this medicine yesterday it is effective for me in controlling the pain about an hour after taking it my head pain is gone that last for about 6 hours before i need another one 50mg what i do not like are the side effects i experience intense tingling and tightening in my upper neck shoulders and arms that is very uncomfortable,pain,1
894,i was lucky to find that sumatriptan works very well for me in regard to migraines i used to wait to take it to make sure i had a real migraine as opposed to a headache i learned finally not to wait the earlier the better the results are quick under an hour and the side affects are minimal even if i wake up with a migraine i can take this and get on with my day perhaps not at 100 but certainly good enough to get things done,"headache, migraine",1
895,prescribed sumatriptan 50mg took one with 2 ibuprofen at 2000 no effect another at 0430 no effect and a third at 1000 with 2 paracetamol no effect by 1130 i had to ring my pharmacist i thought my head was about to implode my fingers numb and my speech slurred sumatriptan appeared to aggravate my migraine and was completely ineffective,migraine,1
896,sumatriptan has been a miracle drug for me i typically wake up with a migraine i take one 100mg pill and drink a cup of caffeinated coffee and almost every time that awful headache is gone i sense no side effects it just works if you are a migraine sufferer and you have hesitated to ask a doctor about this drug wait not one day longer i hope it works for you just as it works for me,"headache, migraine",1
897,i honestly love this medication so much i have been plagued with migraines for over 10 years now and nothing ever worked i spent most of high school and late teens trying to deal with the pain until my doctor prescribed sumatriptan to me a year ago i get 9 100mg pills but 100mg is too much so i break them in half which is nice cause it gives me 18 pills my pharmacist says they work best when you take lots of water so i at the onset of a migraine i try to take them with a full glass plus its good to stay hydrated when you have a migraine anyways it works within an hour and my migraine is gone i do get some muscle soreness throughout my entire body which lasts about 4 to 5 hours afterwards but after a year ive adjusted to it and its honestly way easier to deal with then a migraine i love sumatriptan so much and it has saved me so many times from having to go to work and endure the intense pain of a migraine or having my plans ruined because i have to stay in bed all day the only problem is ive become so reliant on this medication that when i get down to my last pill if i dont have time to get my refill i get really anxious luckily 1 prescripton lasts at least 3 to 4 months,"migraine, pain",1
898,i have been using this drug for year and have had much success with it since they only give you 9 in a bottle i try to take a half a pill as soon as i feel a migraine coming on and most of the time that works since it is generic for imitrexit is much cheaper too i used to take butalbitalfiorinal spand didnt like the way they made me feel prefer this much better ,migraine,1
899,after 18 years of suffering from migraines i was newly prescribed sumatriptan and it has been helping tremendously i have decided to rely largely more on a new diet plan exercise moderation therapy herbs and other natural remedies even thou the side effects are a bit crazylike tiredness body tightness dizzyness nauseous and full on body heatits wayyy better than that ongoing extreme pain and having to go to the er missing out on work and life usually takes about 1hr to 1 12 hrs to work and sometimes it doesnt fully go away but the pain is reduced if you suffer from migraines too i would request you try this out ,pain,1
900,usually stops pain of migraine within 1 hour 12 but does not stop other symptoms works 95 of time a life saver after many years of nothing that releived the pain ,"migraine, pain",1
901,this pill initially works to rid my migraine but by the end of the day its back worse so i have to take another which works maybe 50 of the time then i go to bed and wake up in the middle of the night with another rebound migraine its 5050 again if it will work side effects are nausea unless i eat something with it im extremely hot and sweaty a general feeling of just feeling bad ,"migraine, nausea",1
902,works at least 85 of the time easy to take orally the very small pills nothing else i have ever taken including powerful narcotics has ever worked nearly as effectively and consistently as sumatriptan my doctor told me that it could make me feel a little dizzy after the first few minutes of it taking effect particularly when standing up from a sitting or laying down position but for me there has been zero dizzy spells i have been taking it for years the only side effect i have on rare occasion experienced is a slight nausea that lasts for up to 3 hours but compared to the nausea and pain of the migraines the infrequent and minor level of nausea i have experienced is rather insignificant ,"dizzy spells, nausea, pain",1
903,generic sumatriptan is great if you can find the aurobindo brand almost every pharmacy in my city has switched to the dr reddy brand and dr reddy brand does not work at all i seriously do not think there is any sumatriptan in the dr reddy brand and they must have offered all the pharmacies a lower price than aurobindo because everyone is suddenly only selling dr reddy brand i would pay more for aurobindo if i can ever find it again,,0
904,i usually take a 14 of a 100 mg pill and it will work within 2030 minutes this has been the best pain relief i have ever had i dont usually need to repeat the dosage if i take it fairly quickly after the onset of the migraine excellent medication,"migraine, pain",1
905,have suffered from monthly migraines for over 10 years horrible pain and this med actually works although considerably sleepy and need to take as soon as i feel one coming on,pain,1
906,this medication definitely works on my headache the side effects that i experience include extreme fatigue runny nose hot flashesand trouble concentrating i still like it better than having the migraine i only take a half a pill ,"fatigue, headache, migraine",1
907,when it starts to work my migraine gets worse before it gets better usually within the hour of taking it then the side affects start the nerves in my body tingle for about 23 hours my throat may or may not swell a little bit for awhile but overall but im good after 12 hours its definately better than having a migraine,migraine,1
908,this absolutely got rid of my headaches the reason i give it a 3star satisfaction rating is because of the resulting side effects for me anyway my migraines hit in the middle of the night so when i take this med its usually a couple hours before i get up for the day when drinking my morning coffee it feels like its scalding as it goes down my throat and believe me my morning joe is almost like a milkshake with the amount of cream i add its not straight black my skin also feels ultrasensitive almost like i have a mild sunburn but again this is just my experience at least my head doesnt hurt,sunburn,1
909,works very strangely as it makes all my aura symptoms come at once which is horrible for about 10 minutes but after that im totally fine although really drowsy so still need to sleep all day still get migraine hangovers so feel off for a few days overall its a million times better than other medication ive tried,"aura, migraine",1
910,i have been getting cluster headaches for over 25 years when i am in a cluster i get at least 3 headaches a day for around 4 weeks headaches last 1hour to 24 hours this is the only medication that gives me any relief 100 mg works within 15 to 30 minutes with no noticeable side effectsim not sure what the dangers are for taking more than 400 mg a week as indicated on the limitations but in the moment i dont care so far i have taken 700 mg this week and expect more coming i have searched for info on dangers of taking too much but found nothing suppose i need to contact the pharmacy,,0
911,it definitely works for me but it makes me so dizzy and slow and i almost feel like a zombie if i can lay in a dark room and sleep it off i feel that it works best,,0
912,this is the only rx medication ive tried so far i get migraines every 45 days that last about 24 hrs initially i thought this was a wonder drug i could finally get some relief and feel like a normal person however a few months in i realized about 2024 hours after taking the pill i was getting a rebound migraine this began a vicious cycle only allowed 10 pills a month and having to take one immediately at onset to turn around and have another the next day just didnt work i would end up running out 2 weeks into the month and being miserable until i could get more on to the next one,migraine,1
913,i used to suffer days waking up and going to sleep with migraines until my doctor decided to try this on me i am able to function and not have to take off work because of it any longer now i just have to get my insurance to realize i need these and they should be paying their part why have insurance coverage if you cant get what you need,,0
914,it makes my headaches worse and the side effects are scary my chest feels tights my neck becomes stiff and my head throbs worse than it did before i went to take it ,,0
915,medicine has not been working for me i suffer with migraine headaches everyday i go to bed with them and i wake up with them i cant stand light heat sound and being around talking or lots of people suck with insurance only allowing 9 pills i dont see how i can even really see if this medicine will work,migraine,1
916,does not work for me i hate being a guinea pig for meds but am willing to try everything until something relieves my migraines,,0
917,this medication has allowed me to actually be able to function for the most part when one strikes does not alleviate all symptoms but is far better than a trip to the er,,0
918,side effects are worse than the actual migraine,migraine,1
919,i been taking sumatriptans for 30 years this has always worked for me i agree that the insurance companies should give more than 9 pills a month,,0
920,i have massive migraines just about every day and this medicine has not helped in relieving or easing my headaches,,0
921,this is the worst brand of sumatripan i have ever taken lowers the pain but does not get rid of the pain ,pain,1
922,sumatriptan allows me to continue on with my day after a migraine hits its the best migraine med ive ever tried i get up to 2 migraines with aura a week and now i can actually function after one starts yey,"aura, migraine",1
923,i have had similar issues like others my insurance wont allow me to get enough medication each month to cover all of my migraine headaches this problem really needs to be remedied,migraine,1
924,reduced the headache to an acceptable level it made me feel little tired not too bad though i also become very sensetive to heat i feel my hands burning just washing them in warm water for those who get migraines warm hands and little tiredness are nothing compared to the headache,headache,1
925,this is not a miracle drug but after 11 years of migraines i came across it and it helps a lot i rely largely on diet exercise moderation acupuncture herbs and other natural remedies but sumatriptan is a great drug and my life is better for it ,,0
926,the treatment for my cluster migraines has been very effective i had not had them for 4 years and this medication is far better than the last one i had the problem is that the pharmacy insurance caremarkcvs would not refill my prescription as 9 tablets were supposed to last for 30 days not i spent the morning on the telephone to caremark customer service and the very nice yet uninformed lady agreed to a refill without paying 154 for 9 tablets in future she said that any refills must have prior authorization my doctors office was very agreeable to that and said that when i get down to 6 tablets to give them a call and they would take care of ittime will tell on that part i will make quite sure to call on a monday so that everyone has the allotted 2472 hours to manifest the operation quelle merde times have changed since i was a child and my parents knew all of the doctors who would drop anything including a cocktail to make a house call or a pharmacy call after i was married it was the cold cruel world no longer insulated by my magic doctors it continues to be annoying i have a very accommodating doctor one of my prerequisites and i am preservering to obtain the same from my insurer incidentally i too have fibromyalgia migraines and fibro are related through the mutual symptoms imbalance nerve pain etcetera ,"fibromyalgia, pain",1

962,i have suffered with migraines since i was a teenager tried several different prescription drugs with little or no effect on them until imitrex came onto the market a wonder drug the pain nausea hypersensitivity would disappear within an hour i took it for over a decade with no problems then my insurance company changed coverage so only the generic form was covered the first only time i took the generic version i had anaphylaxis had to be rushed to the hospital resulting in 1000s of dollars in medical bills am appealing to the insurance company along with my doctor to try to be able to return to the namebrand imitrex but in the meantime i have no meds cant afford retail,"hypersensitivity, nausea, pain",1
963,i do not suffer from migraines i suffer from cluster headaches if i take one of these pills at the very onset of a headache the headache is gone within 15 20 minutes the only drawback is the rebound headache i get from aborting the cluster headache is twice as bad as the original headache the only negative thing i can say about this medication is the cost my insurance covers it as a tier 3 the quantity allowed is 8 pills in a 25 day period this would be fine for migraine use but for cluster headaches not a good thing because we can have up to 3 o 5 episodes a day my copay is 69 for 8 pills and the overall cost is close to a whopping 500 for 8 pills ,"cluster headache, headache, migraine",1
964,i have been having migrans for almost 35 ears have had test after test done be on more drugs than i can count the doctor put me on this drug as long as i catch it in the early stages its gone within 15 minutes if i wait to long it take about two hours with a good nap love this pill and i tell everyone about it,,0
965,i have been getting migraines since i was 5 years old ive even had mris done of my brain to see if they found a visible causing source always came up short i would get them all the time due to a severe msg allergy just recently 1 week ago my doctor perscribed sumatriptan succ and i had a horrible day at work this past saturday literally cried my eyes out for the first hour i was there i was already nasueated and then the crying set on a headache which then would have built up to a migraine without reading the back of the bottle i swallowed a dose and then noticed it may cause dizziness and drowsiness so then i ate an apple attempted to help out some of my coworkers w our job and then i suddenly felt elsewhere like i knew i was at work but i didnt feel like i was there i didnt even feel like i was in my own body i told my supervisor and manager and they both said well we have plenty of staff on right now go take a 30min break so i did sat outside did some meditative breathing after 30 min past i came back inside and was freezing then like 3 people told me you dont look so goodmaybe you should go home so i called my boyfriend and he picked me up went home took a bath and a nap awoke feeling completely revived it was just the initial experience of my body trying to recognize what i just induced also fighting off the drowsy and i felt so lost within myself my boyfriend even told me my eyes were glassy and all over the place so i would suggest for me anyways to only take this drug if you have nothing planned for the next couple hours i wouldnt suggest taking this at the office or whereever you happen to be employed i hope this review helps some of you,"crying, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, migraine",1
966,i was given the generic version of imitrex it helped somewhat but i have had to take a second dose and still dont have full relief of the migraine the makers ohm laboratories should note that the pill is so vile tasting that it brought about another round of vomiting not what the migraine sufferer wants to encounter,"migraine, vomiting",1
