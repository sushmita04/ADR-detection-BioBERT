121,ultracet osteoarthritis my doctor prescribed ultracet as an alternative to nsaids the typical nsaid was counter productive over time as they upset my stomach and required prilosec as an additional treatment while ultracet is effective for my arthritis it does not carry over as well as many nsaids did for me it helps with pain for arthritis in my knees and shoulder as prescribed and it works as long as i take this ultracet does not help me in the long term as it does not alleviate much of the swelling that occurs in my knees or shoulder id much prefer relafen without its side effects or ibuprofen along with hydrocodone again i would require prilosec or alternative and hydrocodone does lead to longterm use for me at least ultracet is as effective for me as a duragesic patch and delivers pain relief much sooner the patch is very expensive though and remains cost prohibitive in the longterm i am now taking ultram at 100mg doses 3 x d i have yet to find the perfect medication for my specific requirements though exercise and physical therapy have worked very well along with ultram,"arthritis, osteoarthritis, pain, swelling",1

325,i was taking tylenol for knee pain especially at bedtime for a few years sometimes i would have to take it upon awakening or even during the day but i really needed it at night i was disappointed that its action didnt last longer but i continued to use tylenol because i thought it was probably the safest thing to do to treat the pain even though i sometimes had to take it several times throughout the day i never went over the recommended daily dosage now however my doctor wont let me use it at all she was concerned about its affect on my liver function and had me stop it completely my liver function tests have stabilized since i stopped taking the tylenol i now take aleve it takes fewer doses lasts longer and hasnt caused the problems with my liver,"knee pain, pain",1
326,my only problem with tylenol is due to its ease of use and no immediate apparent side effects and due to the continuing pain from fibromyalgia it became easy to take far too much on a regular basis plus i believe there is a rebound effect to consider the more you take the more the need for it builds thereby losing its effectiveness so after taking more than the label advised for many years to combat the pain i slowly weaned myself off of it now i use relatively little 23 extra strength tylenol per night to take just the edge off the pain and because i no longer overuse it what little i take is more helpful i have chosen to not otherwise use medication to treat my fibromyalgia pain instead relying on exercise and other lifestyle choices im also aware that tylenol is processed through the liver so i avoid drinking alcohol when using it which means most of the time ,"fibromyalgia, pain, rebound effect",1
