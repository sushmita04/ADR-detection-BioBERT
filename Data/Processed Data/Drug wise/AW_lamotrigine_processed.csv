2,24yrs been on 200mg for 2 years now for bpdbd drastic change in my life moods less intense 910 improved but not fully gone considering increasing dose but not sure i still have horrible anxiety and jumpiness feels like i will tip over into mania any time very disconcerting but overall i have to say a miracle drug se when starting off drowsiness etc for a couple weeks normal please dont let it deter you other than that weird se i got period changes for a while but resolved wordfinding difficulty that was a weird one but its gone now too honestly overall an easy medication for me my worst fear is worse side effects or it stops working i pretty much depend on it entirely for a normal functional life,"anxiety, drowsiness, fear, mania",1
3,ive been on this crap since i was like 18 im 27 now and it doesnt work and has made things worse i increased my dosage to the max and have been feeling so sick and psychotic i didnt get any swelling but def have itching skin at times i pee a lot im exhausted all the time noises and sounds bother me i get sensory overload its supposed to help and maybe it does but i think its making my body shut down,swelling,1
4,this medication saved my life when i was 20 years old and i have been on it for almost 4 years now the only side effects i experience are related to memory loss i cannot stand it it seems minor compared to the other side effects but to me it is a big deal however i do understand that when it comes to medication you have to take the good with the bad aside from that this medication is a life saver if you are on a low dose and it is working stay on it in order to avoid side effects including cognitive difficulties,memory loss,1
5,umm yeah been taking this med off and on for the past 20 years and off and on because how horriblely it effects my mood and how easily agitated and aggressive it makes me sadly i can function better with seizures and at least i get a act like myself and do things and be able to sleep at night,,0
6,i started this drug in dec 2018 for anxiety with 25mg twice a day i worked up to 100 mg then 150mg then 200 it has had minimual effect on decreasing anxiety in fact i felt worse with 200 mg and have cut back to 150 mg until i talk to my pa i m not confident that it will help me if after nearyl 3 mo im worse,anxiety,1
7,my doctor started me on the 25mg for 2 weeks bumped me to 50mg for the next two weeks then two weeks after i was up to a 100mg for a few more weeks then finally im now on 200mg a day i suffer from depressionptsd and anxiety disorder ive been on many antidepressants and anxiety medications before but lamictal i can seriously say saved my life,"anxiety, anxiety disorder",1
8,i switched from a vampiric acid oxcarbazapine combo when the vampiric acid wasnt agreeing with my kidneys and got on lamotrogine at first when titrating on to it i experienced insomnia which went away as i got used to it i like it better than the other meds i have taken for my epilepsy but honestly i dont know if i do or if im just more used to the side effects of seizure meds that i got on when i was 16 and dub it superior for not noticing the side effects since i got on it i have had a couple seizures and am debating if its giving me bouts of loss of focus i keep losing focus of my vision but if i look at myself in the mirror or a camera it comes back imidiatly i should probably tell my dr about it but i have friend who every time he comes around it happens and its basicly only when he comes over so im pretty sure its probably people doing some type of psychic dialation of my pupils since they think im some type of retard for being on seizure meds i think i have became a little scitsofeinic since starting lamictal in connection to the spacial plane or something have been diagnosed with scitsophrinia in the past,"epilepsy, insomnia",1
9,i went through tons of antiseizure meds after i started taking lamictal it has been the perfect match my seizures are under control thanks to this med if anyone needs seizure control this is the one,,0
10,it didnt help my mood swings anger or suicidal thoughts it did however give me hand tremors ruined my memory and made me gain 50lbs those side effects mad me more unhappy than anything it might have been doing to help,"anger, mood swings",1
11,i took lamictal for about a month to treat my bpd it was by far the worst medication i have ever taken within a week of being on lamictal i found myself sleeping all day and unable to motivate myself to perform simple tasks around the second week of being on it i began having vivid nightmares as if i was watching a horror film every time i fell asleep i also started to have overwhelming suicidal thoughts and intense dissociation episodes unfortunately dropping the dosage of this medication too quickly may cause a deadly rash so i had to be slowly weened off of it in my experience abilify has been the most effective medication in the treatment of my bpd,"dissociation, rash",1

13,ive been on 600mg for a decade i take half a 150 pill whenever the ringing in my ears gets loud which presages a partial seizure by an hour takes about 20 mins to tone it down if ive missed a dose ill chew it to speed up absorption i take 300mg at night to sleep otherwise wake up and have mild partials i say missed because during the day i only take it as needed up to 300mg but usually less if i dont get enough sleep for a couple days i really need to dose up sleep is super important other stressors less so but def play a factor,,0
14,ive been taking lamictal for a few years now probably 2 years and there has definitely been a difference they have reduced a bit but i had to increase my dose to 700mg a day from the 400mg i started at i have found that even if i take it on time during both morning and night 400mg in the morning 300mg at night i have to be sure that i eat something in the morning or else i will have a seizure later that day and i dont mean a piece of toast i mean a substantial breakfast so it works its just testy as to whether or not that 700mg dose will continue to work throughout the day,,0
15,may have reduced seizures but destroyed my eyes i have lost most of the glands around my eyes giving me astigmatism and looking at anything is painful,,0
16,after three years of insomnia uncontrollable manic outbursts of anger and a host of issues resulting from a traumatic accident i was at the end of my rope this medicine has saved me i feel in control again for the first time in years it saved my job my sanity my life it did upset my stomach for the first week so now i take it at bedtime and im fine occasionally some heart burn but well worth it 100 fold and as an added bonus i realized one day that it had even snuffed down my ocd without me even noticing,"accident, anger, burn, insomnia",1

22,i am a professional musician who had several bizarre disastrous performances before being diagnosed with absence seizures in 2007 which is when i began taking lamictal lamictal alone didnt fully control the absence seizures but it ended the constant excruciating headache that had plagued me for years now i take its generic 400 mg daily in combination with generic equivalent of keppra 2500 mg daily the two have virtually eliminated the absence seizures adequate rest limited work on a computer taking the medication every 12 hours not 11 or 13 etc and avoiding strobe lights have also been helpful i had issues with leg convulsions but these have subsided i think one or both medicines have causedincreased depressionstill a small price to pay for the ability to continue my career,headache,1

34,one of the most important issues to discuss with your doctor is the proper dosing of this medication if started out on to high of a dosage serious and sometimes fatal allergic reactions can occur after two months i was rushed to the hospital with an allergic reaction which was later determined lamictal was the cause i developed stevensjohnson syndrome and was treated in the burn unit and icu for a total of 2 weeks i have multiple longterm complications such as scarring of nearly all of my skin and mucous membranes loss of vision etc if you are taking this mediaction and notice swelling of your lymph glands low grade fever notify your doctor i experienced those symtoms 23 weeks prior to the obvious skin rash breakout and swelling and was told it was the flu i was informed later it was possibly the initial symptoms of sjs,"burn, rash, stevensjohnson syndrome, swelling",1
35,i started out on 100 mgday 3 years ago and am now up to 600 mgday and have been on that dose for about two years now and it hardly helps at all i still have about 20 absence seizures a day with my lamictal it also made me a little slow ive also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression so its never helped me at all in that department not to mention ive vomited several times because the taste is disgusting if youve ever let it stay in your mouth a little too long you know exactly what im talking about,"anxiety, depression",1
36,i never had seizures until i was 30 years old i was diagnosed with epilepsy dilantin was perscribed and it never stopped my seizures they continued to get worse and more frequent i was referred to a neurologist and lamictal was a miracle drug for me i have taken it for 6 years and have had only the aura i have not had a seizure since beginning this medication it is so wonderful to be seizure free,"aura, epilepsy",1
37,this med was a godsend after having experiences from hell while taking topamax and keppra lamictal worked great no auras no seizures i had vivid dreams which were sometimes creepy but sometimes interesting id wake up and ponder it for days then my hair started to fall out i have a lot of hair so i wasnt too concerned i lost weight on lamictal overall i was happy then i woke up one morning with a rash i know there is a fatal rash that accompanies lamictal i am currently waiting for my neuro to call mine is small in the back of my neck and has all these little bumps i felt them which is how i knew i had the rash it doesnt itch but it burns a little bit i know this med causes different kinds of rashes im wondering if anybody else has experienced this how did it start size appearance what did it look like has anybody gotten the rash sjs any information you can provide is greatly appreciated feel free to email me,"fall, rash, vivid dreams",1
38,i have been on this med for three months after being off all meds for 8 months previously tried many meds that made me feel worse and am so happy to have found something that works so well i am on 25mg which is a very low dose so i may go up to 50mg soon give it a try for bpd or bipolar iithe research out there looks promising,,0
39,was on phenob very successful unfortunately it causes bone loss oesteoporosis so slowly changed over to lamictal has grand mal a bout year after lack of sleep missed dosage a few months later same thing for same reasons although i see side affects same as mine i also have mood swings which i think are bipolar one minute im fine and the next i feel like im being conspired against when im out of this mood i look back see how stupid this is but i go back to it i told my dr he said that this med is used for that so shouldnt be but i think it can cause it any one else have this,mood swings,1
40,after the loss of an adult child i was treated for depression and tried many different ad meds without long term success a specialist told me she felt it was totally ptsd with my history of violent incidents which i swept under the brain carpet once i started to research ptsd i knew that was my problem the jumpiness and flashbacks i take 20mg prozac with 2 x 25mg lamictal a day i took it very easy with getting to the right dose of lamictal and had some itchy sensations to begin with but no rash within a few weeks the itchies went away by themselves as did headaches i am now side effect free flashback free and feel close to being my old self it is so trial and error for everyone but after many years of trying i have my answer good luck,"depression, rash, violent",1

44,dreadful when starting to take lamotrigin my first side effect was dyspaxia after increasing dasage furher this seemed to lesson but i got an incredable sore throat and over two weeks lost two stone daylight started to hurt my eyes and after being up the sun for a short period of timeblisters popped up all over my body i was diadnosed with polymorphic light eruption after discontinuation i am no longer allergic to the sun terrible experience however i was on other meds and am unsure of interactions,"eruption, polymorphic light eruption, short period",1
45,reasonably effective but not perfect i use lamictal as a mood stabilizer both for schizophrenia and mood disorder my other diagnosis and it seems to work well enough though i was hospitalized this past summer with a severe mixed episode my doctor and i have worked out an exquisitely finetuned combination of several drugs to treat my illness so it is difficult to say precisely which drug does what at this point since they all work together to keep me stable the lamictal does not seem to cause any untoward side effects however though it is activating enough that i prefer to take it in the morning rash is the one dangerous side effect you must watch for as it could present serious even deadly consequences,"rash, schizophrenia",1
46,lactimal that great mood stabliser when i first started taking lactimal i had only just been diagnosed with bpd and bi polar nos it was pretty overwhelming i started the lactimal on 50g a day not thinking it would do anything and it didnt for a month or so my doctor kept increasing my dose and after a couple of months things got better the only drawback i have with lactimal is sleep deprivation and because my depression periods are so infrequent now when i have them theyre full on im havent been on lactimal for very long so ill see how it goes,depression,1
47,good this med has worked for me,,0
48,less side effects than most was on double the dose and had more seizures tests showed at high levels it was reduced and seizures lessened,,0
49,i take this for seizures caused by lupus im now on three anticonvulsants so its hard to say how effective it is alone i had to start it at a very low dose as i was also on depakote which is a dangerous combination i admit i was scared at first i noticed that i began to have acne pretty badly just after i started it it could be from an interaction with another med though,acne,1
50,useless and effectiveless ive been on it now almost a solid month and if anything the only difference i feel are my ticks have accelerated somewhat theres been no difference in my moods irritability highs and lows etc positively none i have tourette syndrome and have had it most my life w tourette in addition to tics which most people only attribute it too it also does a number on your moods etc ive been on numerous and endless meds w mixed results although i dont consider myself depressed currently which i have been a few times in my life significantly ive been at least modified for the past 10 yrs or so w some dips here and there thats why i went on lamactil only good thing is it was cheap 30 for 1 month lol anyways this med is no better than taking a placebo asperin pill garbage,irritability,1
51,just ok it only worked for me with a combination of about a dozen other medications at the same time i had no side effects and my medicare covered the cost so i dont know how expensive it is without insurance,,0
52,lamictal it caused dizziness eventually we had to split into 4 doses a day to prevent this problem it worked fairly well otherwise,dizziness,1
53,lamictal william is on 75 mg 2 times a day he takes the chewables he has had no side effects after taking valproic acid and having such a bad time i was afraid to try this he has a great love for school and is advanced this med has not interfered with that in any way he does have more colds but no seizures we have been using this med since jan 9 2003 i would recommend this med to anyone at first he had an upset tummy with the raises but after 2 days that stopped i would not use any other med i would rather deal with the seizures after i saw what the valproic acid did lamictal is a great med choice this is an update it has been sveral years now and he continues on the lamictal we tried to wean off once and had a grandmal he is still at 75 mg 2 times we have found out that he reads at a slower pace because of the lamictal he cant take cold meds with pseodurine as it lowers his resistance and so does tylonel its a drug thats easy to give and dosnt taste nasty,,0
54,i would give this drug overall an 8 i do know that this medication helps keep my moods elevated for the most part i havent had any side effects which is the best part of it all,,0
55,staying focused my moods have improved along with the ability too concentrate the only downside i feel more anxious as we increase the dosage my doctor is still working on the dosage to correct the increased anxiety the reason i love the medicine is the only side effect is skin rash if dosage is increased too fastwhich i never experienced i tried depokate and lithium with terrible side effects i was able to discontinue my zoloft im still taking anxiety medication unfortunately i had to up the dose since taking lamictal the is what i mentioned earlier i hope it is only at matter of time,"anxiety, rash",1
56,side effects slowing progress started on 25mg per day for a week slowly worked up to 300mg but the headaches nausea anxiety dizziness night sweats insomnia muscle aches and depression were too much to handle think ive got everything but the rash and so ive gone back down to 200mg per day had 4 seizures whilst weaning off trileptal and onto lamictal but none in the last 2 weeks am finding the nausea and depression very taxing but hoping to start feeling better just worried that im only on my half dose im meant to be taking 400mgday by now but just cant cope with symptoms have been on epilim topamax trileptal keppra and now this just cannot seem to find one that stops the grandmals and is tolerable am seriously considering surgery have been medically boarded from work and im only 25 so am very bored,"anxiety, depression, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, night sweats, rash, surgery",1
57,eased off the tonic clonic seizures eased off the tonic clonic seizires from 34 a week to 23 a month caused tiredness and made me feel a little sick in stomach but maxolyn eased that off,,0
58,so far so good this medication tastes horrible and the pills are very chalky but i havent had too many problems unless i dont take my medicine on its regular basis i forget sometimes and the partial seizures will sneak through then,partial seizures,1
59,caused seizures dr gave me one month starter pack the longer i took lamictal the more jerking seizures i had until my whole upper body was going back and forth,,0
60,so far so good since i started lamotrigine last year i have had no sideeffects except some eczema that i developed previously on clobazam i have been experimenting with different doses150 mg or less gave me some unpleasant night seizures so i tried 175 mg for months and thought things were pretty good until i had two generalized seizures in my sleep last month the recommended minimum dose is 200 mg so i went up to 200 mg and am waiting to see what happens next my verdict on lamotrigine so far so good but maybe carbamazepine was better at keeping generalized seizures at bay time will tell mind you it seems to be a fairly mild drug whose main selling point is the lack of sideeffects and a slight antidepressive effect as a bonus the manufacturer cant boast any improved antiseizure effect compared to established drugs but since the sideeffects of clobazam and especially carbamazepine have been a major problem in my life more than the seizures i am just relieved to have a drug that isnt doing too much harm my verdict on lamotrigine so far so good,eczema,1
61,fine with caveats actually i take 350 ms twice a dayno such option in pulldown menu got there by trial and error my seizures all seem to come in the morning after too much booze ive got two types of epilepsy one congenital one traumarelated the congenital makes alcohol a nonohappened once while taking a lower dose so we upped it slightly then a seizure after a night of binging on diet coke6 cans maybe more during a hot summer night so we upped the dose again to 350 mg x 2 all has been going well doc says to take meds with food so it enters the system slowly preventing any latemorning seizures sideeffects doc said lamictal acts like a stimulant and was a bit unnerved when i told him i didnt feel any lightening of mood or extra energy im 66 years old maybe its too late for stimulants,epilepsy,1
62,better than 400 mg dilantin some complex partial am still transitioning off dilantin down to 150mgday am in a test group to see the affects of lamictal as dilantin is reduced stil have 5 weeks on dilantin its reduced 50mg every 20 weeks last 3 weeks 3 complex partials a week down from 68 2 times an extended period of confusion words spoken and writen lsted about 4 hours no side effects physically,,0
63,i wished it had worked it didnt work for me without kepprai am not sure if it had something to do with the suppliments i started taking i heard they can interfer with the meds i spent months building up the dose and am sorry it didnt seem to work as a monotherapy,,0
64,i dont think this med is doing me any good after 3 brain resections it doesnt work i get dizzy and have bad night sweats when i can get to sleep i seem to have problems sleeping while on this med,night sweats,1
65,are the side effects worth it i have been on several anticonvulsive drugs since i was diagnosed in 1997 ive been on this one for a couple of years but according to the doctor the dosage is high at 300 mg in the morning and 450 mg in the evening but it controls the seizures all of the meds i have tried cause pretty much the same side effects shortterm memory loss vision impairment and loss of balance almost an intoxicated like feeling i have found that taking this medication on a full stomach does ease the effects of vision and balance it is best to take with a meal when possible because a snack just doesnt seem to reduce the side effects because if theyre really bad i cant see to drive im off balance or i just cant keep my eyes open sometimes i feel like im not talking straight it does make me feel ill at times since i still struggled with the side effects for so long i came to terms with the possiblity of surgery which had been recommended several times after much research consideration and prayer i have been evaluated for surgery however my neurologist informed me at my last visit that there is currently not enough information to make me a candidate for surgery however he is adding zonegran to my daily meds so he can bring the lamictal down from 750 mg to 450 mg total for the day so far so good im not all the way down but im sure itll work because when i was in for my video eeg i felt great on the lower doses only problem with lower doses is seizures occur so the zonegran is to help prevent those from occuring so for the time being im in a holding pattern with the new plan of action hopefully the lower dose will alleviate the side effects and give me a better quality of life i do believe the side effects are probably different for each person so each person will have to decide what works best for them i hope you find one that works for you update 41506 i have reache,"memory loss, shortterm memory loss, surgery",1
66,great too high dosage made me dizzy and nauseated,,0
67,excellent i started taking lamictol in november of last year at first i had trouble sleeping and had dizzy states but these side effects have worn off the only thing that troubles me now is the mild headaches that are common with this drug the drug has stopped all my seizures and seems to definately be the drug of choice,,0
68,too much now that i have read all the comments on this med i feel now that i have been taking too much i was up to 600 mg at christmas time ended up in the er from a major reaction of overdose it was very scary i am now slowing way down on seizures i have complexpartial seizures due to a tumor an possibly going to have a 2nd surgery to hopefully stop them all together i am just praying for the best outcome right now,"overdose, surgery",1
69,it made a big difference for me i take this drug for treatment of partial seizures i was taking it exclusively for about 5 months then my doctor added keppra which i reviewed elsewhere on this site already the lamictal made a huge difference for me ive had simple partial seizures for years but they eventually progressed into complex partial seizures which prompted me to seek treatment for a second time more on that in a minute when i was put on lamictal the first thing i noticed as a side effect was that i was extremely tired the day after taking the first dose that was only with the first dose though the only other thing i noticed was that while stepping up the dose once i had a few small panic attacks for about a day and a half but that was an isolated incident and i had only been on this drug for a couple months at that point since then there have been absolutely no side effects this drug totally eliminated my complex partial seizuresbyebye blackouts unfortunately it hasnt been entirely effective at eliminating my simple partial seizures im still fighting an uphill battle with those but id consider no more blacking out to be signifigant progress this is one of those drugs where you need to start out on a very small dose and work your way up to a therapeutic dose i was initially put on a starter kit and worked up to a regular dose over the course of about 3 weeks or so and have increased a bit more a few times since then ive suffered with partial seizures since i was 16 but i wasnt diagnosed until 1997 when i was 23 i tried tegretol and neurontin at that time which did little for me my seizures were minor back then so i decided to stop taking the drugs stop going to the doctor and just live with it big mistake i shouldve stuck with the treatment instead i foolishly let it go and it progressively got worse to the point that i had no choice but to seek treatment again let this be a lesson to youif youre di,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1

72,works great but may not last i started taking lamictal last summer for extreme anxiety and depression i was out of work for three months due to these dibilitating disorders it took a few weeks to see positive results the starter pack took 5 weeks to build up to the 100mg per day theraputic dose the worst side effect for me was that it caused insomnia but that eventually subsided i was given lunesta to help with the insomnia but i only ended up taking it twice and then i was back to a normal sleep cycle another side effect i encountered was dizziness when i turned my head it felt like i was drunk i refrained from driving until that subsided after about two weeks the constant dizziness also caused some nausea dosage was increased to 150mg after two months of use was working wonderfully until additional stresses were encountered in my life both parents with chronic health problems and workload increased all at the same time dose was increased to 200mg this helped with the heart palpitations but was not effective in my mood swings i felt like i was out of control 5mg of lexapro has just been added this week and im already feeling much calmer and relaxed still having ocd tendencies but my mood is more stable im worried that the lamictal dosage will continually be increased,"anxiety, depression, dizziness, insomnia, mood swings, nausea, palpitations",1

74,works well i am bipolar and have epilepsy and panic disorder use to be on dilantin and phenabarb my pdoc decided the two were not working anymore and i also suffer from panic disorder he thought trying me on lamictal would kill 3 birds with one stone lamictal has been great had outgrown a lot of my seizure disorder over the years i also take klonopin and a little seroquel this cocktail mix seems to be working great for me i now take 200mg a day i wont need to titrate it at all the klonopin is only 25 and that has stoped the panic good luck to all oh i did experience some kind of rash after he titrated me but it went away since titrating me again nothing so it may have been something else also headaches but as my body acclimated to it the side effects diminished,"epilepsy, panic disorder, rash",1

77,has anyone used lamictal for bulimiabinge eating i am currently taking lamictal 200mg for a bipolar spectrum mood disorder its not fullblown more like rapid cycling mostly depression however binge eating and problems with emotional regulation emotional eating are big issues for me zoloft 200 mg has helped me with the bingeing in the past however i was taken off zoloft because my doctor was concerned about the possibility of zoloft triggering mania although it never did has anyone been prescribed lamictal for binge eating if so what dose was successful i am not finding that its working too well for the eating issues,"binge eating, depression, mania",1
78,lamictal rate this medication works better than phenobarbital for me i wish i only needed to take it once a day like i did with phenobarbital i have only taken it for a year and a half and i think it might be slightly less effective than a couple months after starting it but it could also be due to stress and being late taking it sometimes i had quite a few side effects when i first started on it but they got better after a few months i still have some dizziness,"dizziness, stress",1
79,expensive garbage this drug caused not only a terrible rash but nausea along with manic states horrible just horrible,"nausea, rash",1
80,the seizure culprit wow i wish i knew from point one that the reason i was having flashbacks strong memory senses how the smell of certain fragrances would throw me back to a certain year during a certain scene etc then no matter the dose i was at grand mal seizures all of this happened due to the drug lamictal i suffered through heart palpitations anxiety what felt like heart attacks they would come on strong the moment i popped the pills i couldnt walk a small distance without losing breath and my heart pounding i am a young 28 year old mother whenever we took me off of it to have my seizures studied at the mayo clinic epilepsy monitoring unit i would ironically begin to feel great heart wise my flashbacks would subside etc the moment i started the drugs back up i would get the worst seizure feelings again needless to say over the course of the two years i was beginning to really feel where it was coming from from the suffering it caused grand mal seizures and complex partial seizures from stress and anxiety and complete lack of sleep i became very introverted and unhappyi will say this before the drug was increased and caused this much stress i was still more open and happy just when the stress and seizures and crazy feelings wouldnt subside that is when i became so introverted so i dont feel the drug is to blame for that fully more my situation we finally looked into a second brain surgery i had that done april of 2005 which took out a significant amount i will need to have out for any pill to ever work for me i was always on phenobarbital and my body continues to require that about a month and a half after surgery i seized i decided no more lamictal the moment i stopped that pill all the weird sensations left no anxiety no heart problems no weird smells no flashbacks or strong memories i survive through that time of the month with no seizures i sleep through the night without high doses of drugs i,"anxiety, complex partial seizures, epilepsy, palpitations, partial seizures, stress, surgery",1

82,high dose im on 300mg of lamictal once daily due to the severity of my borderline personality bipolar wth trauma i also take 10 mg of abilify daily which is very expensive lamictal has proven to help a great deal with the mixed states but now i distinctly have depression and mania and its very frustrating the abilify helped with the hallucinations but it makes very manic so my doctor and i are still tweaking it,"depression, mania, trauma",1

84,pretty good i am updating this review the stuff below is still true but i am slightly changing things now that i have been on the medicine for almost a year the medicine is not controlling my seizures it is helping my eegs are much better but not normal i have been up to 450mgs of lamictal and am currently at 350mgs what i have noticed since i began is insomnia occasional lack of balance an itchy rash each time i went up in dose and a slightly fuzzy state of mind this fuzzy state of mind increases with each aed anti epileptic drug i add to my pill box my husband and i are looking at having a child in the next few years they said that this is the best choice for people like me i currently take 200mg in the am and 100 in the pm the heavy dose is in the am to reduce the chance of insomnia i only get the insomnia a few times a week any caffeine after 10 am makes it worse this is also lamictal related melatonin is great for the nights i do have insomnia and you dont need an rx to get it the balance thing isnt too bad i am just more likely to lose it every once in a while in situations i would never have before the fuzzy state of mind seems to primarily affect my pronouncation of words i know very well what the word is but how to pronounce it can be problematic to me this does not happen all of the time maybe 3x a week overall i really like the drug because after doing tons of research the other drugs have much worse side effects than this one i am not interested in the weight gain or bone loss one other thing being young i am very sad not to be able to drink with my friends anymore,"insomnia, rash",1

86,an update after seeing a pediatric neurologist my sons diagnosis has changed to primary generalized epilepsy he has been taken off the tranxene and is now solely on lamictal were slowly working up the dosage which i really appreciate because it means less severe side effects at this point my son is on 100mg a day and his seizures are worse in number however the drop attacks have stopped and he is dealing with myoclonic seizures the neuro warned us that it gets worse before you reach the appropriate dose so we are sticking it out to make sure this is the drug,epilepsy,1

95,very happy with med but not the cost after 10 years on depakote and tegretol combined and separate and at least 2 seizures a month while on them a specialist told me to try lamictal immediately i stopped having seizures unless i forgot to take the pills mixed with birth control pills or drank liquor and was very pleased theni lost my job and didnt have insurance i took 600 mg which was almost 500 a month i am suffering with no insurance just to get my pills for free talk with your neurologist about this program make sure you have insurance before trying this drug i am very happy with the meds just not the cost i am considering switching so i can have insurance,,0
96,better than other options for depression and more lamictal is slowly making me feel better first it took most of the depression away i am also more patient and open with my family less angry with the world in general and the ocd thoughts and habits have lessened i was diagnosed as borderline 10 years ago and dismissed it as misogyny but recently went back into therapy and was diagnosed as somewhere in the bipolar spectrum with ocd and anxiety issues as well i tried an antidepressant which made me feel like an ungrounded electric wire then seroquel whose side effects outweighed its benefits then finally lamictal with lunesta for my anxietyinsomnia which got me off the xanax ive been taking for years so far so good i wouldnt say im cured but things are definately looking better side effects ive noticed are slight acne and increased sweating,"acne, anxiety, depression, sweating",1

99,works for depression not great for memory ive been on lamictal for many months now and it seems to be the one drug that has turned me in the right direction i first tried it over a couple of years ago but my doctor made a mistake and took me off of celexa and put me on lamictal at the same time i had a huge crash and my husband had to call doctor to help me get up off the floor in histerics i went back on my usual meds and tried lamictal again a few months later it was great i started with a low dose and now am taking 150mg twice a day i was also taking lexapro at the time and was extremely sleepy my doctor took me off of lexapro and put me on cymbalta 60mg a couple of months ago and i feel much better i have a huge problem with short term memory and a lot of things i say are backward ie lunch instead of breakfast in instead of out,depression,1
100,lamotrogine this drug has been very effective for the control of my epilepsy this medication does have an effect on my sleep as i do sometime feel drained and i sleep alot more however i decided that with this medication i have shown no other side effects and i would rather exchange some sleepy days than a change in medication and risk of frequent seziures or dramatic sideeffects i live in england under the nhs so i would not have an idea about cost effectiveness other than that for me these drugs have had little influence on my life and are simple to take with these drugs i feel free and am able to do whatever tasks i enjoy as the drug is fairly new the future ahead is not precisely know especially as i am an 18yr old women but at present i am more than happy with lamotrogine,epilepsy,1

119,works but at a price i had lamictal added to my dilantin two years ago to treat my complex partial seizures and immediately noticed i was having trouble walking straight almost like the sensation of walking on a boat at sea the feeling caused me to have a sense of motionsickness i had to hold on to things to keep from walking into walls i was sleepy and lost my appetite too which added to my problems the only good thing that happened was my seizure frequency decreased by 50 my doctor encouraged me to stick with the medication and it took about a year for most of the side effects to subside,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1
120,very useful in three ways for me lamictal works quite well for me i take 200mg in the am and 300mg in the pm the board didnt accomodate my dose i have it as a mood stabilizer for migraine prevention and as an antiseizure med it takes care of all three for me and ive never had any side effects from it quite happy,migraine,1
121,lamictal just another drug i have had epilepsy for 17 of my 27 years of life i have been on 6 other medications all to no avail i have found that ever since i started this medication my memory sucks my mind doesnt work as well and i have a real hard time remembering things trouble sleeping bad mood swings violence coming out of a seizure and real trouble getting it too damn expensive if you have no insurance i have also had some of the other side effects mentioned just never severe and i have to my knowledge never had problems with a rash i am tired of drugs they work for a while then start to have problems with their effectiveness i hate knowing that a seizure is coming on and there is nothing i can do about it with drugs like lamictal,"epilepsy, mood swings, rash",1
122,stopped gran mals have not had a single gran mal seizure in the last 14 years on lamictal and have had only 2 auras in all that time tegretol and dilantin never did a thing for me and too many neurologists just wont give up overmedicating with evil drugs rather than move on to something else only side effects from lamictal have been shingles and chicken pox type symptoms once and i knew there was a connection with the drug doctors doubted any connections have always had small night time sleepless disorders 3x mo that are somewhat minor but annoying tried keppra for those guess whatshingles and an increase of seizures keppra is not for me,,0
123,loved it till i got the rash i took lamictal with neurontin and topamax and it was the first time my seizures were totally under control this was a cool deali wasnt spacing out during the day and i wasnt tossing my blankets across the room at night and waking up in a total ijusthadaseizure fog the combination is the first and only thing that 100 got ride of the nocturnal grand mals unfortunately within 3 weeks i got the dreaded rash in a biiiig way think poison ivy only like one of those detergent commercials where they timelapse the spread so you can watch the action it was for real very scary i had to go off it and my doctor doesnt feel it is worth the risk of trying again since it spread so quickly,rash,1
124,good drug watch for drug to drug interactions ive been on lamictal 100 2x a day carbatrol tegretol xr 300 2x a day for over 5 years its been a great combo however at first my lamictal level was too high and caused many more seizures rather than preventing them most literature now warns of adding too much lamictal as adjunctive therapy at this time though i do have problems with sleep but not certain if they are related to the lamictal,,0
125,lamictal abilify success for now ive been taking lamictal for almost a year now but have been cautious about reporting here on its effectiveness i wanted to see how it helped long term well i must say lamictal is now an integral part of my therapy which combined with abilify has improved and stabilized my mood for the most part and im thinking clearly without nearly as much paranoia selfdefeatism and isolation as before i cant emphasize how much the combination of finding the right meds a huge challenge in itself a strong support system of family or friends especially people in similar circumstances an impartial person to talk to psychologist counselor social worker or psychiatrist who is knowledgeable about bipolar disorder and that essential elementtime are important to recoverywhich by the way is possible as a side note my diagnosis was recently changed from schizoaffective disorder to bipolar but those are just labels to help categorize our different symptomsim still the same person maybe just mellowed with age o,"bipolar disorder, paranoia, schizoaffective disorder",1

127,lamictal and epilepsy best meds so far for epilepsy varying side effects are increasing and include what i would consider a bipolar effect one minute im happy as can be and the next i want to kill women and small children very bad blinding rage which is unlike me noted increased social anxiety too paranoid and suspicious given ativan at leisure to counter the side effects however the dosage is too small or should be taken regularly,"anxiety, epilepsy, rage",1
128,lamictal wow lamictal has served me well it is the third drug i have tried in 25 years which sounds great doesnt it but looking back tegretol and phenytoin together supported me but had side effects a new neurologist suggested epilim then moving on to epilim chronos disaster weight gain hair loss tremors blurred sight spontaneous bruising etc so i refused to take it any more and the doc prescribed lamictal lamotrigine wowslowly but surely the seizures are decreasing in number and severity to some degree the side effects minimal with the one being that the withdrawal type symptoms develop quite quickly as the next dose time approaches so to forget the dose or not carry it with you when going it means that i feel fuzzy vaguely stiff in the muscles and unsettled which is quite uncomfortable i take the tablets and within a short period 1520 minutes feel great lamictal is far superior in its response to my seizures than epilim ever was,"short period, spontaneous bruising",1
129,somewhat effective i took lamictal as at that time an experimental drug right when it was released i started on the dose pack working up to 100mg and my seizures were lessened but not taken away altogether meaning i still couldnt trust myself to drive etc it wasnt at that time indicated as a solo drug but id been having severe reactions to the more established ones so we kept pushing on my seizures eventually died down but one side effect even after dropping to 25mg a day never went awayremember the v8 keep your diet straight commercials unlike any other med this one played with my neurology in a way i couldnt handlei always perceived standing straight up as leaning to the right i compensated for this feeling of toppling one way by stumbling on my feet hallways became a place i just didnt venture alone because enough times of walking into walls makes you really dislike them we tried seeing if i could tolerate it for 6 months before we gave up i wanted to like this drug as that was the only side effect whereas the others had disastrous ones but between sidestepping and still having seizures without strong auras too to warn me here and there it wasnt worth it,,0
130,first seizure in 12 years a few months ago my doctor recommended i ween off of phenobarbital because of the depression i suffered he actually wanted to stop medication completely since i hadnt had a seizure in 12 years a few days ago i was driving down the interstate and had a seizure i drove for 10 miles down the wrong side of the interstate before going off the road and flipping my minivan the van is totalled but i walked away with only bruises and no memory of the event the only side effects i had noticed up to this point were sleep relatedbeing wide awake after only 4 hours of sleep or waking up every couple of hours during the night unfortunately my neurologist would not see me he simply doubled my dose so i am now taking 100mg twice daily i am very concerned about all of this i dont know yet whether i will continue with the lamictal or try something else at this point i dont know if the lamictal is ineffective or if the dose is simply too low,depression,1
131,lamictal didnt do a thing for the siezures but took away our daughter for months from us she was completely flat on it,,0
132,lamotriginecarbemazepine reaction i am 27 female and have had epilepsy for about 10 years i was on carbemazepine which did not provide full control and i thought what i wanted was full control so they tried adding lamictal unfortunately the combination gave me some interesting side effects i was really badtempered while on it but i think this is quite common during the first few months i have never had food poisoning but i thought i had it i know this sick feeling now but it is quite alarming i did not get the effect all the time they started me on very low doses of lamictal to avoid it however nobody ever told me that alcohol and aeds dont mix with the benefit of hindsight i wonder if it was truly the two drugs disagreeing with me or because of alcohol what i remember happening was about 3 days after a single drink i would get dizzy get diarrhoea and severe vomiting i could not sit up straight and was most comfortable least dizzy and nauseous laying twisted over the side of the bed the higher my head the worse it was this would last for several days at a time due to these effects my doctors took me off the drug although i think it was working quite well unfortunately i did not suspect the alcohol till i had the same effect on a different combination of drugs so i dont know for sure what caused this effect i cant be sure it never happened without alcohol ps part of the effect before you feel really ill can almost be described as being heavily intoxicated without having drunk anything the things i have found to help the most with this type of effect are always to eat before taking pills and laying down to sleep through it when it happens fresh air is also a relief,"diarrhoea, epilepsy, food poisoning, poisoning, vomiting",1
133,side effects lamictal 400mg daily ive been on for at least three years i have no seizures during the day since surgery which was 8 years ago however they occur sometimes when asleep this month has been a hard one since i got sice three nights so far it actually makes me tense about going to sleep interesting reading others effects with this,surgery,1
134,didnt work but no cognitive side effects my son was actually on 175mgs and although i didnt find any cognitive disadvantages the drug would cause more seizures every time it was increased i was told to keep increasing and it just made him worseregardless he went from cps to full blown tcs,,0
135,so far so good i suffered from grand mals after an auto accident ive been taking lamictal for a year 75mgs twice a day side effects are limited to occasional fatigue sleepiness during the day and difficulty sleeping at night after a second eeg my brainwaves havent reregulated themselves but this was only after 6 months of taking the meds id rate it good to excellent not cheap though 300 or so per month,"accident, difficulty sleeping, fatigue",1

140,yeah success at last my daughter has had seizures since early childhood lamictal is the adjunct drug that actually consistently controlled her grand mal seizures tegretol did not control them the combination of 2600 mg of neurontin daily and lamactil has worked fairly well we use valium to break seizure cycles in five day bursts if needed however memory problems persist,,0
141,saved my life i dont know where i would be without lamictal it was tough at the beginning because i had lots of side effects for up to two months i had an allergic rash different from stevensjohnsons rash severe dry mouth bad headaches and the worst nausea but like i said it got so much better now the rapid cycling is gone i still suffer from some depression but no more manic stages and the depression is not nearly as bad i was in a really bad place when i first started lamictal and now im functioning i highly recommend that if you are experiencing side effects to stick it out it is so worth the bad side effects at the beginning,"allergic rash, depression, dry mouth, nausea, rash",1
142,insomnia lamictal caused serious insomnia,insomnia,1
143,so far so good my son has been on this for 9 months he is doing great some shakiness but i can live better without grand mals everyday we still have some breaking through but not like they were so far so good and he eats,shakiness,1
144,ferrets experiences i am on this and topamaxtopiramatethere was a lot of blurred and double vision at 1st till the level was set but that all settled they are the only 2 drugs that have controlled all my seizures completely and have done so now for just on 3 yrs this after trying just about every other drug for approx 17yrs or so i love em and wouldnt realy care how much they cost or how dificult they were to take after having anywhere up to 20 absent or complex partial seizures a day and a couple of grand mal a month to having none at all ill cop alot to stay on em thanx just give them time to settle and get the doses adjusted right then shell be right mate,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1
145,lamictal is definitely an improvement lamictal in terms of lack of side effects and ease of use was simply an amazing drug my particular condition has been resistant to just about every treatment so far lamictal was however the most effective of any drug yet and the side effects were simply nonexistent this may not be true for smaller younger or females but overall lamictal is certainly a step in the right direction from tegretol and depakote,,0
146,lamictalearly side effects seems to be working my wife has been taking this medication after we and our nuerologist discussed that it might be the best choice for pregnancy she has been on it for about 7 months and only one seizure when she was ramping up possibly due to interaction with tegretol and that she missed a dose lots of side effects while ramping up like dizziness and tremorsshaking this has subsided though somebody needs to develop a generic though,"dizziness, pregnancy",1
147,i love it i have been using lamictal for 4 years now as of 2003 and it finally stopped my big seizures,,0
148,cost prohibitive the cost of lamictal is almost more than i will be able to bear under my retirement income i will however state that it is and has been the best medication ive been on so far i suffer from complex partial seizures and have run the gamut of medications this is my last hope and has proven to be helpful in controlling mine there are side effects read about them and just because you doctor says it cant be that know that there is a rising percentage of those who experience the same side effects,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1

150,works for me i have used lamictal for about 4 years it has been more effective than any other medication i tried i have had no known bad side effects so far the only thing i noticed was that i lost some weight once i started using it unlike depakote which made me gain weight all though it is usually used in adjuction with other seizure meds i however use lamictal by it self it has worked well for me so far it works for my sister as well i do agree with you all that it does indeed cost way too much,,0
151,not effective at all my daughter was on lamictil for approximately 6 months she tremored and shook a lot her urine became discolored and smelled awlful i convinced her neurologist to try something else and he did she is now on zonegran 100 mg 2 capsules in the evening she has improved some on this medication,,0

178,ive been taking lamictal for 5 years now and am very pleased with it i have experienced moderate to severe difficulties with cognitive function and memory on all other antiepileptics lamictal has enabled me to reduce my carbamazapine intake to such a level that these difficulties are minimal and i am now doing very well at university unfortunately while it has reduced my seizures to lower than ever before it has not been able to stop them altogether,,0

181,so my first seizure was when i was 13 i have tried many meds but this one seemed to work the best but as the years have passed my memory has been going a lot and it seems to be getting worse and worse i took it upon myself to stop the medicine cold turkey id been on for 56 years now so its not recommended and yet i havent had any symptoms of a seizure and my memory is starting to come back my sister was also on it but for depression she almost lost her eye sight because she missed 1 day of taking it so please be careful and do your research on each drug that you are about to go on,depression,1
182,i have been on lamictal for seven years 300 mg morning and 200 mg in the evening i had been on topamax before but my neurologist switched because of side effects after the switch my amount of seizures increased dramatically to about 5 per month and i was having them without any warning it was as if i was not on any medication i have always been controlled with medicines the neurologist refused to believe it was from the lamictal and kept saying it was because my body had to adjust to the change in medicine after about 6 months a doctor at a different hospital put me on keppra in addition to the lamictal i have only had one seizure since ,,0

217,i have had adverse reactions to five different medicines for seizures i started taking lamictal about 6 months ago and am very pleased i have hardly any side effects at all my only problem is that i dont have insurance because i am self employed and lamictal is very expensive i am not sure if a generic is available for lamictal lamictal has been a relief with minimal side effects,,0
218,i hate lamotrigine my epilepsy has been controlled 100 while taking dilantin for 38 years my doctor highly recommended that i change dilantin to lamotrigine because dilantin is a very old drug and has a long term side effect of memory loss i really did not want to make this change but he managed to convince me i made the change december 2018 and since then my life has turned upside down no coordination memory loss cannot remember things that happened minutes before constantly forgetting where i placed things worse of it all ive been on the decline with making good decisions at work speech writing typing reading difficulties i truly felt that i have early signs of alzheimer of dementia i could not stand it i finally insisted to my doctor to go back to dilantin immediately i am now back on dilation for 3 days and i am just praying to god i will get back to normal again,"dementia, epilepsy, memory loss",1

221,i suffer does anybody enjoy from very infrequent grand mal seizures and take 300 mg per day lamotrigine has been effective in preventing seizures but the side effects have caused me to consider changing medicines i went from being a nice guy to periodic bouts of nastiness cant remember names or even some of the places ive been frequently cant remember where i put things or parked and my hair has thinned considerably i checked to see if hair loss is a common side effect it is but im told the hair comes back after people stop using lamotrigine looking forward to changing meds,,0
222,my pharmacy and likely yours changes the manufacturers of generics regularly to get the best price that year it turns out that sometimes the best priced medications are not therapeutically the same unichem makes lamotrigine that maintains my drug levels and prevents my seizures a seizure results in the temporary loss of driving privilege truly you dont want to seize while driving and hit someone the restriction continues for six months if you cant imagine it imagine being sixteen again and staying out too late one night with your parents car they ground you for six months its like that especially for seizure meds insist on the same manufacturer every time you get your prescription filled,,0
223,wow wow wow lamotrigine was the fourth medication i tried for epilepsy and the only one that worked no extreme side effects other than memory problems i thought i was one of those people who medications wont work for but this here is great,epilepsy,1
224,when i started going to my new neurologist she transitioned me over to lamotrigine for my epilepsy because if i was to get pregnant it causes the least amount of birth defects compared to keppra and topiramate i had fewer side effects with lamotrigine and specifically the unichem manufacturers well 4 years after i started taking lamotrigine i did get pregnant over the course of 9 months i needed to adjust my medication from 500mg to 1000mg however no seizures thankfully the one downside about the unichem manufactures is a lot of pharmacies dont carry it for lamotrigine and need to put in a special order so sometimes you need to call multiple pharmacies to see how quick they can order it i have found in the past couple months that walgreens specifically carries the unichem brand,epilepsy,1
225,i was 17 yo when my doctor put me on this lamotrigine medication to treat my juvenile myoclonic epilepsy jme which had been acting up at the time after a couple days on the meds i started feeling sick and got little mini jerks but nobody was around to see them so i wasnt sure if it was the epilepsy or if it was in my head i told my doctor next time i saw him i wanted off the medication he then told me the meds were safe and tripled my dose the next couple of months i couldnt get out of bed in the morning without having seizure after seizure eventually it led to a grandmal and only then would my neurologist see me about it unfortunately i found online that its a pretty common thing for others with jme to have this experience taking lamictal my doctor didnt explain these risks to me and if he had i would have exercised my right as a patient to refuse the treatment based on how the meds were making me feel and this never would have happened if you are reading this and are unsure about lamictal just steer clear,"epilepsy, feeling sick, myoclonic epilepsy",1
226,i have had good seizure control for my grand mal seizure with lamotrigine i started off on teva brand but found out recently that the company discontinued making it and i had to switch to another brand this has caused some mood swings and nausea but i think i will get used to it i take 200 mg morning and night previously i was on tegratol and put up with some nasty side effects this drug worked much better with fewer mood swings i would like to reduce lamotrigine and use medical marijuana which would have far fewer side effects it is hard to find a neurologist to help with that option thanks for sharing experiences it really helps to connect with people out there,"mood swings, nausea",1
227,my psychiatrist prescribed lamotragine for my add i started at 25mgday and and worked up to 400mg over a few months my wife noticed a difference in a week or less from the time i started using it ive used it for over 5 years either my add has gotten worse or the dosage i use had become less effective but its still of value ive noticed no adverse effects although i did stop biting my fingernails after i started using it that wasnt expected i do get low to moderate anxiety if i miss a dose this is notable because i have had anxiety issues in the past and i believed that my add was causing work related anxiety i will retire soon and plan to be weaned off of it then it will be interesting to see if anxiety becomes its own issue or not,anxiety,1
228,i wont talk about my experience of how it controlled epilepsy because i dont know when i was on keppra i was a terrible person when i was taking it alone feeling angry and depressed all the time after another violent seizure i was prescribed lamictal on top of keppra i tried to refuse to take it but ended up taking it anyways along with keppra once i reached 100mg bd all of the keppra side effects were gone and i felt like a different person but like any antiepilipsy medicine there are side effects and i had two 1 i couldnt sleep more than 5 hours at night i never used an alarm to wake up you wish to need it once you reach this level 2 dry mouth nostrils and eyes dry to the point i cant open my eyes when i wake up and i needed an eyedrop to open my eyes my mouth was dry despite not being thirsty my eyes and mouth literally felt like sandpaper,"dry mouth, epilepsy, violent",1
