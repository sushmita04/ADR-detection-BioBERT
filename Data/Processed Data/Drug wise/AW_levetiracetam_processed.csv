0,keppra sucks i went from 200mg to 3000mg a day all it did was make my joint hurt and make me snap over little things i do no recommend keppra i went from one seizure ever few years to several seizures a week on this drug i stop taking it with out my dr ok and i felt better after about a week off it and the back pain iv had for 20 was 2000 times worse on the man made bs medication,"back pain, pain",1
1,never let anyone you love take this horrible drug i had nearly two months of paranoid hallucinations anxiety major weight loss from 185 lbs to 142 lbs 63 yo male stopped it abruptly and i was fine the next day and ever after,anxiety,1
2,ive had 3 seizures over 10 years grand mal and was prescribed this after the first one this medication completely changed me i got full on kepprarage to start with and on top of not being able to drive i was horrible to everyone who tried to help i then got extremely bad suicidal thoughts depression and anxiety i tried to ask my neurologist for help but he kept telling me keppra is the best on the market my personality changed my appetite changed i lost all motivation i was tired all the time and constantly had headaches i just recently went off keppra due to not being able to stand the suicidal thoughts anymore and after a month i am finally starting to feel like myself again after years i truly hope other peoples experiences are better than mine i wish i would have gone off keppra sooner,"anxiety, depression",1
3,i could not eat nothing looked good feel like i ate alot food when and had 2 bites feel no good all the time,,0
4,i think keppra is a good medication since its fulfills its purpose of stopping or improving seizures in most people my only advice is be cautious with your dosing and listen to your body there are certainly side effects some go away after a while some dont keppra is a bitter sweet medicine always be sure to give the medication time to truly determine how it affects you long term dose adjustments can always be made all i know is there are way worse medications out there so if keppra works for you be happy with it find alternative ways to manage mild side effects if you can,,0
5,i took keppra for partial and grand mal seizures 11 years ago it was the worst medication i had ever taken in my life i experienced all the side effects including the rare ones i had dropped 30 lbs in 30 days because i couldnt make myself eat and i had no appetite whatsoever i was only 125 to start with at 52 it seemed like forever before i gained it back alot of time it seemed like i was incapable of focus i had to take 1 month leave of absence from work and it wasnt enough i should have taken 3 eventually things started to get a little better but then it was like a roller coaster it got to the point to where i just couldnt take it anymore and was prescribed something else it worked great with partial seizures not so much with grand mal seizures,partial seizures,1
6,i think from what i am reading other reviews is that you have to gauge what the correct dose is for you and lower the dose till you find a safe zone i got down to 250mg a day starting in the morning it sets the tone for the day that way though i only have partial that can evolve to grand mal some are worse off obviously with full time grand mals no one knows you better than yourself read the literature youtube videos and become and expert on your condition also use additional levers like diet meditation and other meds for bad days to support like benzos for breakthru days the reality is your brain is now unstable so you have to treat it like an egg you have to change your life and you have to be highly aware of the rhythm of your thoughts all easier said than done in our current digital hurry up world,,0
7,extremely effective for complex partial seizures but the side effects are too crazy ill have days where everything im too exhausted to do anything and others where i have too much energy to focus the exhaustion is unbearable in the winter season if youre experiencing the exhausted symptoms i recommend playing a rhythmbased game idk why but it helps alleviate the blah feelings,"complex partial seizures, exhaustion, partial seizures",1
8,i take keppra xr 500 mg at night ive been on it for about 6 years now for mild partial seizures likely originating in my temporal lobe i like keppra because i never noticed much as far as initial side effects with it other than maybe some mild dizziness the first few days of being on it over the years though i have noticed that ive become somewhat forgetful and have a general lack of energylack of motivation when i didnt used to but its hard to determine whether thats from the keppra or my other medical issues i suffer from fibromyalgia as well i have not noticed any seizures since being on it,"dizziness, fibromyalgia, partial seizures",1
9,i was diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy when i was 14 i am now 20 i took lamotrigine at first and it kept me from having grand mal seizures but i still had myoclonic jerks so they put me on keppra too i take 500mg in the morning and 1000mg at night i take 300 mg of lamotrigine every 12 hours and its been working perfectly fine ive had seizures every now and then but thats because sometimes i dont get enough sleep because of schoolwork keppra changed me completely it was weird because the side effects really hit me when i was around 1718 i asked my doctor if that was possible and he said yes he said the side effects can hit you whenever i was so depressed i didnt feel like doing anything my mood swings were and still are pretty rough i get super nauseous too i lose my appetite sometimes and it just sucks the list goes on ive tried other medications and the only one that really stops my seizures is keppra so i cant get off it i recommend anything but keppra but if its the only thing that works for you i guess your stuck taking it like me,"epilepsy, mood swings, myoclonic epilepsy",1
10,i have been taking keppra since i started having seizures in 2012 from a brain injury it has worked for the most part but i still have mini seizures all the time i take 1500 mg of it twice daily,"brain injury, injury",1
11,i developed focal seizures as a result of having a brain tumor before removing the tumor id tried lamictal zonisamide and gabapentin without success they put me on keppra posttumor removal as prophylaxis either the tumor removal or the keppra stopped the seizures so i dont really know likely the removal of the tumor along with time for edema to settle was the real reason either way keppra had way fewer side effects at 1000mg bid than zonisamide 200mg bid or lamictal 300mg bid only pitfall was that after weaning off the drug 2yrs later tinnitus came on strong occurred exactly 2 days after my last dose,tinnitus,1
12,i took keppra for about 5 months in those 5 months i became a new person and it wasnt good keppra caused my personality to change completely anxiety depression panic attacks and headaches the only good about it was it did prevent seizures i wouldve never even put it into my body if i knew how bad the side effects were i would just be very cautious when taking this medication,"anxiety, anxiety depression, depression",1
13,keppra has generated horrible sude affects with me increased angerirritability nausea diarrhea muscle pain near the kidneys depression lack of appetite sadness lazinessfatigue loss of concentration taking 500 mg every 12 hours,"depression, nausea, pain",1
14,my husband has been taking 500 mg twice a day for a yer now he sleeps 18 hrs out of 24 hrs personality has changed dramaticlly and not for the better never wants to leave the house not interested in anything this medication sucks big time,,0
15,ive been on keppra since 2014 after being on clonazepam at first when i had my first seizure aged 12 both meds stopped my seizures but they took me off clonazepam as it is addictive cant be taken when pregnant keppra is a safe drug and has been very effective ive noticed since being on it that i am more tired easily and very heavy eyed other than that ive been ok occasional anxiety feelings of being low but i blame hormones for that i take 250mg 2x daily and will do so for as long as possible anything to not have a seizure in my eyes,anxiety,1
16,i became very emotional and depressed fatigue overtook me and i seriously thought i was dying i had blurry vision every single day and lighting bothered me i seen doctor after doctor thinking that the diagnosis was wrong not realizing it was the drug the entire time it was not until i switch from mercy health to the cleveland clinic that it was discovered what the problem really was i will also say when i told my doctor my symptoms instead of realizing it was a side effect he increase my dosage which increased my side effects,fatigue,1
17,i started taking keppra 3 months ago and im seizure free since i started taking 750mg twice daily a lot of people are talking about different side effects but these side effects are on the leaflet lately ive been getting irritated very easily and aggressive behaviour but at the same time i havent been eating and exercising a balanced diet so that could be a cause either a lot is down to your gp and you if you get depression or anything consult your gp if you are not happy with the medication try a other last year i was on epilim 500 mg twice daily i had multiple seizures last year but i was also binge drinking a lot but since ive started drinking in moderation maybe a few bottles here and there it quenches the urge to binge again so u found alcohol to have a devastating effect on it with me,depression,1
18,my son was put on keppra a little over a month ago they started him on a schedule where he worked up to 6ml bid he started getting longer absence seizures his brain is so foggy he couldnt even do simple addition yesterday he has severe leg weakness at times that makes it so he cant walk he cries at the drop if a hat he has become impulsive and aggressive after his video eeg we are taking him off it asap,,0
19,more effective than my lamotrigine on its own has ever been at stopping seizures had 3 grand mal ones before and after taking keppra and only had myoclonic seizures if i missed a dose however it also caused depressive and anxiety episodes and lead to self harm and suicidal ideation,"anxiety, suicidal ideation",1

21,worst drug ever in my opinion simply does nothing but make my condition worse here were my side effects irritability paranoia anxiety generally feeling very sick like nausea loss of appetite numbness and tingling in my arms and legs it would make my aura seizures come more often than they normally would without medication cause me to feel dizzy and light headed most of the time and in particular and the dizziness and light headed down feeling would worsen a great deal during an aura seizure and same with the paranoia feeling which does not happen normally if i was not on medication when i started to get numbness and tingling it would be so bad and scary that i admitted myself to hospital a few times and even the doctors didnt say it was from my medication well how else did this stop right after i stopped the medication it would also cause me to get aura seizures when i was still asleep and it would wake me up it would also make my aura seizures feel much worse it would make me feel suicidal at times as well i took the medication for about six months and have had more than enough of it i at one stage was taking one tablet twice a day then even two tablets,"anxiety, aura, dizziness, irritability, nausea, numbness, paranoia",1
22,been on 1500 mg twice daily for complex partial seizures at first i was worried about reported side effects fortunately i have responded very well to the drug and have had no seizures i also take 150 mg lamictal twice a day,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1
23,i was diagnosed with focal epilepsy around five years ago and was put on tegretol 200mg to control my seizures in 2017 i went into convulsive status epilepticus so it was decided by my doctors that i must take tegretol cr 200mg and keppra 500mg twice daily it has been over two years now since commencing keppra and i have had no seizures when i first started keppra i noticed a number of side effects such as experiencing vivid dreams at night mood swings teeth grinding confused thinking fatigue frequent headaches poor memory and concentration i think my confused thinking and headaches are linked with the vivid dreams impacting on my sleep quality taking melatonin and magnesium seems to have improved my sleep quality in the morning i have started having a vitamin b active complex and vitamin d3 supplements with breakfast which helps with my fatigue i read that vitamin b6 p5p form can help reduce some of the adverse effects of keppra so it made sense to try it,"epilepsy, fatigue, frequent headaches, mood swings, status epilepticus, vivid dreams",1
24,i note that reviews of keppra range from extremely negative to positive something weird is going on with this drug my experience was the horrible dark toxic type described below again this drug apparently works for some but definitely not for me it didnt affect my seizure rate at all btw this rate was about a every 2 h nonstop night day and now after being at the end of my tether this is just partly under control with eplim while im still reducing keppra to zero asap the worse thing was that some of the sideeffects of the drug or what i think now were side effects including confused thinking sore eyes feeling hot flushed face feeling angry heart racing brain pounding were easy to get confused with some of the worst effects of my condition so the doctors attributed them to the condition not the drug so i was prescribed just more of the same drug i took 25 gday at the height of it a downward spiral into hell at that point i was at breaking point now at 1 gday i can sort of cope good luck to all,"feeling hot, heart racing",1
25,horrible dark toxic drug and the drs are mixing this toxic drug with other aeds and causing more damage than good,,0

49,this drug is the saddest excuse for a medicine my father was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had it surgically removed they couldnt remove it in certain areas and we were told it was cancerous stage 4 my father never had history of seizures and was put on an extremely high dose of kepra since then he acts like a zombie can hardly talk cannot control his urine it is absolutely a sad sight he never had history of seizure and now if we were to cut off his doses he would initially have a seizure what kind of fucking treatment is that we have been steadily decreasing the ml and he is having mild symptoms of stroke half his body is going numb face is drooping and can hardly walk normally this is what happens when you introduce this dangerous chemical into someones body who does not need it there in the first place fuck the hospitals and institutionalized doctors what a load of shit instead of helping you they pump you full of drugs in order to weaken you even more which keeps you coming back and bringing them profit god bless you all,,0

66,i started having grand mal seizures when i was 12 and was originally on tegratol untill i was 1617 turns out that medication made me seize more so i was switched to 1000mg of keppra it has worked wonders controlling my seizures when i take it properlyresponsibly ive gone monthsyears seizure free i went from having multiple seizures in the span of a few months to seizure free but the infamous keppra rage has and continues to be an issue for me even now as an adult b6 and vitamin d helps a bit along with not drinking getting enough sleep and physical activities like yogalong walkstai chietc i struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle and when i dont do something like yogameditation to maintain balance i notice a definate increased struggle in keeping my cool in a moment i go from already unnecessarily irritated to infuriated in that moment i imagine grabbing whoever by the hair and slamming their face into the nearest surface obviously i dont act upon such impulses but i am unnerved that this little medication can make me feel that much rage and that disturbs me i also notice i struggle with short term memory as well which is frustrating but ive some,rage,1
67,at 54 i started having tonicclonic seizures like fainting at first my physician prescribed phenytoin dilantin it worked but i was zoned out and groggy after about a year i was switched to levetiracetam generic keppra for about the first year it was pretty good was able to work with my doctor to find the minimal dosage to resolve my problems i take one 750mg pill a day 12 of it in am 12 in pm this is a low dose overall over time i started developing anger and moodyness issues google keppra rage and developed ever increasing memory loss issues particularly short term memory ive tried b6 b12 d3 it may help but its not enough my doctor is switching me to lamotrigine generic lamictal well see how that goes right now im taking both slowly increasing lamictal while still on keppra and im a total bastard at times i so feel for my spouse i truly hope that the issues subside after going onto lamictal only the plus side however is that keppra truly does work to prevent seizures it might just be the only drug for your issue just work with your doctor to find the right dosage and be aware of the side effects,"anger, memory loss, rage, tonicclonic seizures",1
68,the generic version of this drug made me literally insane i would talk about how i wanted to die lay in bed all day lash out at loved ones cry constantly my neurologist put me on the brand name keppra because he said the binding agents within the generic can exaserbate potential side effects significantly after switching to the brand name all of those emotional problems diminished i have had brand name medically necessary on my precriptions ever since twice i tried going back to the generic version of this drug and got the same insane personality back again both times looking back i think perhaps the brand name may have made me more tired and reckless at times or not its tough to say because ive been on it so long i do know that if brand name keppra has given me any side effects that theyre not nearly as bad as the side effects from the generic version while some people obviously might have negative reactions to both versions of this medication i think its extremely important for people to know that the emotional issues and negative depressive andor suicidal thoughts can be due to the fact that you need to try the brand name if you are currently taking the g,emotional problems,1
69,taking keppra is to live while you are dead it sucks the life out of you making you wish a seizure had killed you before you got put on this drug it makes you depressed suicidal forgetful and out of touch with your own body and mind in general i begged my neurologist to take me off this drug for months and he finally agreed yesterday i do not have epilepsy i just had a withdrawal seizure from abruptly stopping a psychiatric medication i would not wish this experience on my worst enemy,epilepsy,1
70,keppra was awful it was the first drug i took when i was diagnosed with epilepsy and it completely destroyed my mental health the side effects were awful these mostly include severe anxiety and depression almost immediately after taking this drug i felt as though i never wanted to get out of bed i began panicking and getting overwhelmed by farfetched thoughts and stresses in life i had dreams where i committed suicide my newonset stress and anxiety held me back from going out and socializing and made me contemplate my own life being an otherwise mentally healthy person i was extremely concerned by these symptoms that i had no control over and knew it had to be a side effect of the drug i told my neurologist and i immediately changed to 150mg of lamotrigine lamictal which works wonders prevents my epileptic seizures and is also used as a mood stabilizer so im sure thats why mental sideeffects dont exist with the new drug avoid keppra unless all other drugs fail to prevent your seizures,"anxiety, depression, epilepsy, stress, suicide",1
71,just started on them for sezuires just sleepy thats it fantastic medication feel dead chilled out,,0
72,i think the dosage is important with this drug i began taking 1 pill twice a day then switched over to two pills once a day it made a huge difference my side effects cut in half no more tingly chills goosebumps all over my legs and not so ditsy and i felt much more confident i still experience the lethargic feelings do i exist what if this person had never met would i still exist i would but not to them these thoughts would flash through my mind so fast and intensely that i wasnt entirely aware of what was happening because as soon as it ended i couldnt remember like waking from a dream and having it at the tip of your mind but the more you wake up the more it fades it happened enough times that i started remembering what the thoughts were weird overall the drug stopped my seizures i just wouldnt recommend it to anyone whos suicidal because the thought of death not the act of killing one self but the thought of what if i die enters my mind frequently now i dont struggle with those types of problem so its more of a curious thing for me and at the very least inspired me to write up a will just in case,"chills, death",1
73,ive been on this medication for 5 months now and all i have to say is its life changing this med has given me confidence i have uncontrollable body movements and was nervous of dropping stuff all the time ever since i started i feel more relaxed and easy going beginning side effects was hard but pushing threw for the sake of embarrassment was worth following regiment i feel normal and its a big relieve not having to worry about my uncontrollable body jerks its only 500mg daily but my provider stated if thats whats working just stick with,worry,1

75,every company that makes this medicine should be sued it has such mixed results for me personally it nearly cost me my life the american government sucks to even have statutes against suing manufacturers when it can take years for a patient to realize that all their issues were caused by the drug including seizures for a drug that is intended to control seizures to actually cause themshould be illegal to produce it doctors get paid for prescribing keppraall the reason for them to prescribe regardless of how it affects the patient america aint so great ,,0
76,i would like to know how long keppra takes to work i take the generic form levetiractam twice daily at 500 milligrams went off of dilatin because of side effectsive been taking it for a monthno seizure control whatsoeverno side effects nothing feels like eating candydoes nothinglost job now due to seizures that was supposed to be controlled by useless medicinedilatin was wonderful had no seizures whatsoever as and switched to keppraonly had 9 seizures in past weektwo hospitalizations,,0
77,i think keppra is greati had to take dilantin for many years until my doctor started me on thisvery few side effects and since i have been taking it my seizures have gone from 1 every 2 years or so to 1 every 5 yearsits pretty expensive but thats what insurance is for,,0
78,ive had 6 grand mal seizures total and around 1500 absence seizures this drug made my grand mal ones nearly stop ive had 2 since ive been on it and i occasionally have small ones when stressed the side effects are awful i feel bipolar now and so angry i either am too emotional or emotionless i use to be a people person and now i dont like to talk to people as much it makes me tired all of the time great treatment of you can deal with side effects im still taking it currently and im 19,,0
79,4 months ago i was put on keppra after my second trip to the er for extreme seizures that resulted in facial scars and sprains one time i fell down three flights of stairs thank god as i rolled i didnt break anything and somehow literally landed on my feet my neurologist believes i have a late onset of a kind of epilepsy that develops in teens im in my mid twenties the first twothree weeks on keppra i had no seizures but never felt like myself i felt like i didnt really care about anything i wondered who would care if i died etc it was an awful place the side effects have gotten better but i still feel the lethargic side effects others have mentioned i also seem to be less social thankfully my family has been really supportive in helping me cope with this i learned a lesson the hard way today dont miss a dose especially two in a row all my epileptic symptoms started coming back first mental seizures then stuttering by the time i got to my hotel to take the pill i was having seizures over my entire body thankfully the keppra kicked in and put me to sleep but i do feel much more stable now i take 750mg a day meeting my neurologist next week i think we,"epilepsy, stuttering",1
80,i had three grand mal seizures last year resulting in two new shoulders five broken vertebrae a fractured cheek bone and over 50 stitches in my face so i should say how awesome is since im eleven months seizure free but lets be real this stiff sucks i am self employed and have found this drug devastating no energy no memory no income im starting bio feedback therapy if it helps i will update,,0
81,i have taken keppra for 9 yrs i had a benign brain tumor in 06 that caused a seizure i had surgery and was placed on keppra 500mg twice a day to prevent seizures i had no seizures or side effects in 2010 i had a regrowth of the tumor causing mild seizures this time it was cancourous i was placed on a higher dose of 1500 mg twice a day then had surgery and treatment i am still on the same dose of keppra with no seizures since the tumor removal i have experienced what i would consider minimal or no side effects from the drug there seems to be slight withdrawls tenseness when to many doses are missed but i rarely miss more than a dose or two i have also discovered cannabis oil and began using it as part of my treatment its been a wonder drug for me i felt like death on chemo and cannabis was a miracle discovery please consider more research into it as well 5 yrs cancerseizure free and still on keppra,"death, surgery",1
82,i have been on keppra for 2 years now following my last seizure the mood changes seem to stem from a dilution of the filter that keeps your thoughts and emotions bottled up inside i now will think and say things to people that i normally would keep to myself these outburst seem to be more prevalent in stressful situations conversely in a relaxed situation my thought patterns flow in a more unencumbered manner i feel more intelligent imaginative and creative also and this will mean little or nothing to non participants of the sport my golf game has improved by 8 to 10 strokes in an 18 hole round this is incredible considering am 57 years old and have been playing consistently for 45 years it seems as if the extraneous thought patterns that affect the moment a golf swing are minimized allowing me to perform closer to the way i had planned i have gone from shooting scores in the mid 80s to consistently scoring in the mid 70s and have shot 2 rounds under par people who dont golf including my neurologist make light of this theory but regular golfers will agree that an improvement of this magnitude just does not happen especially at my age i currently tak,,0
83,i have very few seizures with many years in between having one and caused as an adult when under extreme stress i have been used as a guinea pig being put on different pills that make me a very depressed person with among other side affects i want to feel normal happy person i am while taking a antiseizure medicine not feel like im drugged up the only pill i know that makes me feel normal is phenobarbital but these doctors wont listen,stress,1
84,i developed a seizure disorder when i was 18 having multiple seizures a day i was unable to be left alone drive work or basically do anything with out supervision my neurologist put me on keppra immediately at first i continued having seizures while on the medication my doctor kept upping the dose finally when i reached 2000mgsday 1000 in the am and 1000 in the pm i stopped having seizures unfortunately i was exhausted all the time i would take it in the morning and then three hours later would need a 45 hour nap needless to say this disrupted my life just like the seizures were i could now go unsupervised but basically did nothing but sleep it was a miracle to not have seizures anymore but sleeping all the time wasnt a solution either,,0
85,if you find that some of the ratings are all 4 or 5 everyone i have spoken to has side effects be careful not to believe unbelievable ratings you never know who works for companies and some of the ratings may be put there as subliminal advertising this is a balancing decision whether you are prepared to tolerate the drugs side effects or suffer seizures it is awful and just awful for people who you are living with too everyone needs to read about what to expect from being on keppra there are vitamins that help relieve them b12 and something called exstress but it will be hard to live with nothing in life doesnt have a price to pay for the good it does but it still works better than any other drug i have ever been prescribed so i will carry on taking it even though there will be more tears and anxiety than i used to have to live with god bless you whoever you arei take 2 500mg tablets morning and night and have been on keppra with lamotrigine for 2 months now,anxiety,1
86,at first it is brilliant it simply stops seizures it seems like a miracle drug but the side effects get worse and worse as time goes by it takes a few weeks until the moods and anxiety get dreadful to cope with extreme depression and tearfullness get worse each day it is bad for people who live in the same house and provokes arguments and emotional distress keppra makes you very tired even falling asleep approximately 5 hours after taking it by the time the side effects become very bad you have got used to not having seizures and it would be awful to choose between going through the side effects and going through the seizures i have chosen to tolerate the side effects but the miracle of the drug stopping the seizures is not there any longer generally difficult to balance but take vitamin b12 and it relieves side effects quite well good luck to anyone suffering hope your families will understand your plight,"anxiety, depression, distress, emotional distress",1

88,i have used keppra in conjunction with dilantin to control my seizures since 2004 in 2003 i had two seizures caused by a brain tumor a meningioma and it is a great drug since it has become available in generic form i do not believe it is as costly as indicatedmy side effects are minimal occasional blurry vision usually midafternoon i do take vitamin d supplements in conjunction with keppra since i get my drugs from the va there is only a nominal cost,meningioma,1
89,hi im terry i have tryed a lot of other meds for my seizures nothing worked and all made me sick the doctor put me on keppra it helps me somewhat i also think that this medication should be at the top of the list to be used first,,0
90,if you have complex partial seizures ask your drs about keppra along with vimpat vimpat 100mg in am pm keppra 500mg which in my case was increased up to 2 12 pills in am and pm keppra by itself did not stop seizures while i was on keppra alone i was having small memory loss could not remember anything when i came to vimpat changed everything while on keppra alone i was driving to work and ran into the back of someone had a seizures and kept going i had no idea 10 min after the fact what had happened the front of my car was bashed in and i had no idea what had happened because i had a full blown complex partial seizure had to hire a lawyer so i would not be given a ticket for hit run all charges were dropped because i had all medical records from dr if you have complex partial seizures do not drive,"complex partial seizures, memory loss, partial seizures",1
91,for those of you on keppra ask your drs about vimpat given along with keppra my husband was diagnosed with complex partial seisures and was put on keppra 500mg 2 12 in morning and 2 12 at night along with 100mg in am and 100mg at night he has been himself since the dr added this new drug called vimpat when he was on keppra which we had to have increased several times he was still having black outs with his memory we were getting scared nothing was going to work the last time in with his dr he added 100 mg in am and pm totally a different person himself yes he still feels tired at times but thats the trade off when he was on keppra by itself he would cry for no reason very emotional vimpat changed all that we also went to emory in atlanta and they agreed vimpat was a good choice i am hoping we can reduce the mg of keppra and keep vimpat that will be our next question to dr if you dont have insurance vimpat is very expensive but worth every penny,,0
92,when i first started taking keppra i became very agitated and drowsy my personality changed and i was convinced i hated this medication over time my body adjusted and the only side affect that i can see is that i still become very agitated very easily this is the only drug that helps me that doesnt affect my liver that means more than me being a little agitated,,0

103,ive been dealing with grand mal seizures for about 4 years i never have an idea when they are going to occur and they are very random its very hard to deal with at times and the last thing you want to deal with is a medication that can perform to your standards as well i was on lamictal for the first few years and i became moody and angry and on top of that was getting rashes instantly after taking my medication finally i seeked out a new doctor who knew that this wasnt the medication for me he put me on keppra and i dont deal with any side effects and so far its been working i would recommend it to anyone,,0

106,does not like other drugs when i was first introduced to keppra it was trial and error i had been on carbamazipine and ethosuximide for years and was stable after the birth of my son i decided to try other medications i was first introduced to lamotrigine and the side effects were awful at this stage i was then introduced to keppra and was told to remain on the full dosage of the other medication until i reached 1500mg keppra i have never been so ill it is difficult to state what the effects from the keppra and the interactions after struggling to reach the required 1500mg i became very ill it started with a sore throat and an inability to move i lost two stone in two weeks now the middle of summer light began to hurt my eyes after going to the doctor to discuss my meds and drop the lamotrigin i started developing blisters all over i went straight back to the doctor and diagnosed polymorphic light eruption the blisters then turned into psorisis i was in crisis i insisted on dropping all the lamotrogine also carbamazipine and bringing ethosuximide to a minimum dose my doctor agreed this was the best way forward as we needed to alliminate side effects through trial when i eventually got to 1500mg and 250mg ethosuximide it was decided the keppra was above my tolerence i have since moved down to 1250mg a day my control is still not as stable as when i was on the carbamazipine and ethosuximide but if you dont try these things you will never know my side effects from the keppra are lack of motivation tired pins and needles especially in the evening when my meds are due it is a finicky drug it requires scheduled times not just morning and night you cannot have so much as a sip of alcohol as you feel effects immediatly at least with the others i could have a glass of wine on a special occasion not that that bothers me it is not advisable to have a single glass with these meds i dont bother for my own sake since the allimination of the other d,"eruption, polymorphic light eruption",1

110,a good start and a frightful fizzle i was given keppra by a psychiatrist who was seeing me for free as i had no insurance at the time he told me i had a cyclic mood disorder which i came to find out was what he told everyone they had i officially have gad anyways the first thing i noticed about keppra was that it made me sleep like crazy i could fall asleep anywhere at any time of day it wasnt dangerous as i didnt drive but it kept me from doing anything for a while though it was also a blessing of course as i got plenty of rest kind of scared me though because i usually wake up if i need to for some reason but this stuff knocked me out so hard that my roommates could do crazy stuff without waking me up and i have pictures to prove it after about a week i noticed that i was starting to do things that i was always too depressed or anxious to do little things like clean my room or fix something that had been broken for months so things were looking good but pretty soon it got to where i was popping a few over the course of the day the psychiatrist had recommended that to me as i had commented that i started feeling worse later in the day and after perhaps a month or two it stopped helping me get to sleep somewhere around this time it came to my attention that there were serious holes in my short term memory i had done things that i had no recollection of even if clues were right in front of me nothing bad thankfully but it scared me so bad that i stopped taking it right away,fall,1

112,much improved keppra cut back the amount of partial seizures that i had my only complaint was being tired for the seizures that i continued to have it changed the length of them so that they would last only 5 to 10 seconds by the time they ended i was just realizing that i was having one im already on tegretol and neurontin so i didnt know how many more options i would have before considering vns i would suggest keppra to others,partial seizures,1
113,holding breath but its still working its been a year and my son is still seeing success with the keppra he is still taking lamictal as well but not sure how long it will be before the doctor decides to take him off that just a note keppra can cause major mood issues the doctor recommended extra b6magnesium to help with this side effect and it really does help the days my son doesnt have the supplements are the days he is most aggressive,,0
114,keep on keeping on keppra did wonders for my 8 yr old son he has myoclonic seizures since 1 yrs old and keppra has helped the best he was also taking lamictal along with the keppra but we think the lamictal was giving him some bad side effects we weened him off the lamictal and hes doing alot better in school if you can get past the side effectsif anythan its definitely worth taking,,0

116,4 yr on keppra since 1 yr old at first keppra worked on my son though we have had to continuously raised his dosage now a couple yrs later seizures are breaking through we have tried to add trleptal had to dis continue almost immediately now drs are talking possible surgey my son does seem to have sensitive eyes alot of aggression vit b6 added will continue to watch for other downsides to med have had no problem using this med,aggression,1
117,best medication used yet the hardest thing about keppra was getting onto it i was previously on tegretol and was having increasingly frequent complex partial siezures but i found i became very depressed in the first six weeks i was getting used to keppra it was only because i was warned that changing onto the drug would have its difficulties that i persisted and have found it satisfactory since,,0
118,good to see a site like this i would say that compared to other anticonvulsants i have taken over 30 yrs that this has been the most helpful please note however i do take 6 tablets 750mg daily,,0
119,so far so good zero side effects good control i was put on keppra as a cautionary move after developing kidney stones while taking zonegran i do not take it in conjunction with any other medications as far as preventing or lessening the onset of seizures keppra has been nearly as effective for me as zonegran after six months on keppra i experienced two complex partial seizures the same morning something that had never happened to me i was more surprised than anything having been being essentially seizure free on zonegran and keppra respectively up to that point so im noting things going forward at my next follow up visit i expect the recommendation will be a hike in dosage aside from that ive not experienced noticeable side effects and have been pleased in general this is my fourth medication in 10 years so im interested in the comparable effectiveness incidence of side effects etc this site has taught me a great deal about the diversity of experiences people have with the same medication so i strive to carefully observe things i experience from the number of reviews it looks as though this has been either effective or at least tried a lot lately,"complex partial seizures, partial seizures",1
120,keeping the hounds away my five year old daughter has intractable seizures she is status post a frontal lobectomy to remove two tumors due to her tuberous sclerosis keppra is her 12th aed she currently also takes vigabatrin and depakote she has complex partial and generalized seizures with a history of infantile spasms since starting the keppra we saw a huge reduction in generalized seizures recently the generalized seizures have returned however are greatly reduced in length and level of intervention necessary to stop them since starting the keppra we have only had to give her diastat twice and that is within the last 2 months so i fear other issues are occuring all in all we have had no side effects with the keppra she tolerates it very well takes it very well and we have been pleased with its results given the battles we face with seizures,fear,1
121,easy switch from tegretol i am switching to keppra from tegretol and have found the change to be much easier than expected i do feel tired and weak sometimes but of course i felt that way on tegretol as well so far so good,,0
122,good but there are side effects try b6 ive only had 3 seizures except one febrile seizure as an infant the first one less than a year ago were still trying to determine if theres a cause or even if it might be convulsive syncope since ive gone months between seizures this isnt easy but just in case ive been taking keppra and the side effects have been much worse than i anticipated ive always had an excellent memory but now i cant remember things events i was at words i need spellings etc the mood swings irritation and rage over small things and depression have been bad tingling and twitching in mouth lips fingers and toes were bad but as my dosage increased i began getting sores on my tongue and mouth especially in the corners of my lips dizziness uncoordination a feeling like motion sickness or that feeling you get when you read in the car this is frequent sometimes i have no energy cant make myself get off the couch ive also suddenly developed an allergy to certain metals i cant wear my watches anymore and ibuprofin now gives me a severe rash it especially makes it hard to put up with because we dont know yet if the keppra is even doing anything to help me to help with the depression and mood swings i started taking noni it helped a lot i no longer had crying fits from frustration and depression every afternoon and i was able to control the anger at little things but it didnt help the other side effects then i got a tip to try 100 mg of b6 funny thing a lot of the side effects i was getting were the same as the symptoms of a b6 deficiency it took several days but i have seen an improvement since i started the b6 the sores in my mouth are almost gone and most of the other symptoms are improved but not gone my memory still betrays me though and i havent tested the metal allergy or ibuprofin my doctor had never heard of using b6 he said it wouldnt hurt but doubted it,"anger, crying, depression, dizziness, frustration, mood swings, motion sickness, rage, rash, sickness, syncope",1
123,turning point in my life i was already taking epilim 2000mg a day and clobazam 20mg a day but seizures were as bad as ever since keppra was added to my meds at 2000mg a day i have been seizure free since day one the first thing i noticed was how clear my mind felt and if anything my memory has improved there has been none of the side effects that i have read about with other peoples experiences with keppra i still suffer from occasional depression but i do suffer from clinical depression and even that has improved due in part to the fact that im seizure free the only thing i cant comment on is cost because i get my meds free on the nhs i dont mean to sound evangelical about it but the title of the review says it all,depression,1
124,works well with side effects had my first seizures in april at age 37 2 grand mals back to back then was started on keppra 500mg 2x daily didnt have anymore grand mals but had petit mals about every other day for over a month then dose was upped to 750mg 2x daily and have been on that dose for about 1 month i have had 2 or 3 brief petit mals since then which is a major improvement but have felt worn out and tired for the past few weeks and dont seem to sleep very well even though im getting 8 hours or more daily,,0
125,lost my appetite lost my energy wanted to die keppra never controlled my seizures but i didnt focus much on that more and more i felt everything was hopeless i lost my appetite and didnt even care about getting out of bed i was too zombified to drive and didnt want to talk to friends or family who grew increasingly and rightly concerned about me one night i found myself suddenly not wanting to take a sleeping pill because it would deplete my supply and i thought i shouldnt do that just in case the thought seemed to come out of nowhere and terrified me so much i burst into tears i realized i could never do that hated myself for being a coward and cried more once the depression started i cried nearly every day i was on keppra since the night i didnt take that sleeping pill i thought about death every day the suicidal thoughts and depression went away once i stopped the keppra i had hoped if i stuck it out for a few weeks maybe 5 weeks all the horrible side effects would go away if i could just be strong enough maybe it would be worth it i also had consistent ear pain after a couple weeks on keppra soon after stopping the medicine i found myself with a high fever a bleeding ear throwing up an ear infection another gift from keppra i believe its third most common side effect,"death, depression, ear infection, ear pain, infection, pain",1
126,very expensive not effective i have to take 2 other drugs as well lamotrigine and epival as keppra ive only been on keppra for 2months and have had no improvement in controlling my seizures,,0
127,amazing granted i have only been on keppra for 2months but from being on depakote for 12yrs im so glad for the change please dont get me wrong depakote was a blessing considering me and my mother never even knew what a seizure was until i had my first one it controlled my serzures completly until i as a rebelious child took the initiative to take myself off the med which led to having another seizure now what brought along the change in meds was the age factor considering that i am getting to the child bearing yrs and my doctor felt it would be better to change meds due to the birth defects caused by depakote may 5th 2006 i had multiple seizures over a course of at least 12hrs that they know of due to stopping the depakote again at that time my doctor decided to make this change in meds atleast five yrs earlier i had started feeling not myself but since i never really knew the base of what myself was i didnt know any different to tell the doc about it but when i changed to keppra it just has made me feel quicker happier more aware alert almost and dont laugh when i say this even smarter as though it has cleared my mind im so glad of this change in meds ive also started taking dilatin along with it but dr says just for temp time so i really dont know if its the keppra or the dilantin hopfully the keppra since the dilantin is only temp good luck to all with this seizure issue and god bless,,0
128,new dose is great ive been on k alone for over a year and i can honestly give you all advice on it if you just started you will feel fruity for 2 to 4 weeks the lowest dose i was on was 1000mg daily after the first few weeks i had no sz and no side effects life went on and i had a few breakthroughs and they were worse than any sz id had but i only had maybe 2 my dose was upped to 2000 mgs daily at this level i began to have the awful side effects depression which led to night terrors and insomnia a little bit of trazodone helped at this level of medication i began using vitmin supps and had more sz than i had since before i started k in nov 2005 i had my dosage upped to a max of 3000 mgs daily and i feel great i see my neuro later this month june and ill see what she says ive only had a few while on the new dose but i feel better than ever,"depression, insomnia",1

132,like taking a sugar pill keppra although ive heard of it working for othersdid absolutely nothing for me it was supposed to help control my mania but while on it i had one of the worst spells since starting treatment a few side effects though nothing badbut since it totally didnt work for me i wasnt on it for long not a fan,mania,1

134,good experience so far i had a single seizure event in january effectiveness it is difficult for me to rate the effectiveness of keppra because i dont know what life would be like without it ie i dont know if i could have another seizure therefore i have rated the effectiveness of keppra as a 5 which is a neutral rating side effects i rated this a 9 because until recently i havent suffered from any of the documented side effects perhaps my dosage is low enough to not see side effects at all or right away or perhaps i need to be on the drug longer or perhaps im lucky to have found an antiseizure drug which works for me i was originally on dilantin which i ended up being allergic to then i was moved to trileptal which i ended up being allergic to fingers are crossed that no more drug moves are needed because as we all know drug transitions are the worst with antiseizure medication the one side effect i experienced was increased irritability every day my neurologist advised me to take b6 within 48 hours of starting 25mg of b6 daily i no longer experience irritability ease of use couldnt be any easier take one 500mg pill every 12 hours effectiveness after long term use same response as effectiveness above cost effectiveness i have health insurance which covers keppra as a level 2 prescription so i only have to pay 20 for a threemonth prescription thru the mail if i picked up my prescription locally at a pharmacy i would be paying 20month,irritability,1

139,horrific this drug possibly was geared for men i dont know i have found that is sooo not true with all of the emails i get but it was the most depressive psychotic drug ever i was on phenobarbital yes it can be weepy but this was different i got curious you look it up it states everywhere in side effects suicidal ideations so on and so forth several actually committed suicide prior it being fda approved not one for me nor anyone post partum nor if they were on a high dose of phenobarbital i was so depressed and didnt want to stick around man was i ever cranky in addition to being so depressed and even wound up in a psych ward from it for my neurologist back in alabama didnt even understand the swift mood change i got from it i was in there for 5 nights they didnt realize you come off of the drug it is a whole new light the interesting timing of when i was placed on this drug was i just had my baby in 2001 and was coming off a huge dosing of phenobarbital i had been placed on he had tried to bring me down to 360 from 660 i was seizing bad he kept upping my dose to the max dose of keppra 3000 then also placed me on klonopin 5x3 found to be a depressant for methank god it didnt control my seizures nothing did so i was pulled off of it nonetheless being postpartum and throw all that in i had it a bit more hard than the normal seizure patient on that drug trial just make sure you study what your doctor does before you take it on if you have a lot going on in your life this drug probably isnt the wisest decision you just shouldnt have to be on antidepressants for a drug to control your seizure when there are drugs out there that dont tear your mood down i always thank god he guided me to my current doctor or i wonder if i would still be breathing air i get sooooo many emails from all different people that either are on it have been on it or have a loved one on it i truly recommend talking to people who ha,"suicide, wound",1

143,its ok but watch your moodemotions while on it i take this drug in addition to lamictal for treatment of focal seizures i was on lamictal alone for awhile which eliminated my complex partial seizures and slightly reduced the frequency of my simple partial seizures my doctor added keppra and i immediately noticed a big improvement in control of my seizures but after several months the simple partial seizures increased in frequency again i was put on a higher dose and things leveled off for awhilebut then picked up again im now on an even higher dose and the simple partial seizures are sporadic if you take this drug you should watch your emotions and overall mood carefully im more irritable than i was before and im normally a bit irritable as it is ive also been depressed off and on for the past several months and most recently extremely depressed sometimes ive even had some passing thoughts of suicide which are becoming rather frequent i cant say with 100 certainty that this drug is the culpritit could be something altogether different because im having some other difficulties in my life at the moment i find that having epilepsy itself is a bit depressing but in hindsight these big changes in my overall mood seem to have started a few months after first taking it and i started to connect the dots after researching this drug some more maybe its just a coincidence but please if you take this drug or any other aed for that matter watch yourself and have close friends or relatives watch you too because a drug might negatively affect your emotions and you may not even realize it yourself ill be talking to my doctor soon to see if i can go on a lower dose or stop it to see if my mood changes heres an update since i posted this review i cut back a little on the dosage of keppra at my doctors suggestion i was at 2500mg a day now down to the regular 2000mgday my mood has improved slightly and the depr,"complex partial seizures, epilepsy, partial seizures, suicide",1

168,hey whats a seizure again hope im not jinxing myself by saying that but after getting a more or less stable level of keppra in my system took it for two weeks went back to clonazepam for a week because the keppra didnt seem to be doing anything dont judge it until at least a month if you have no horrible side effects back on the keppra for another week then a week where for various reasons i only ended up taking about one pill a day then it took 4 or 5 more days of taking my pills breakfastanddinnerlikeclockwork for me to feel normal ive had fewer partial seizures than you can count on the fingers of one hand and its been two and a half or so that ive taken the pills without missing any which is quite a change from a few simple partials a day and unknown occurrences of complex partials havent had a confirmed one of those since ive been on it so im pretty happy only thing that sucks is the feeling stoned out of my mind the week i first started it not when i restarted after the clonazepam and when i was forgetting a lot of pills curiously enough having a single alcoholic drink one night seemed to snap me back into reality temporarily and the bit of depression the first week i was on it this didnt come back anytime after the first week even when i wasnt being good with my meds also even with my living in canada and having a drug plan its still expensive relatively so while im thinking 3x a day dosing might be better since it seems to leave your system so quickly i havent mentioned it to my doctor yet because of the cost having only been on it four months total including the onoff time im not going to rate long term effectiveness but at the moment im about as happy as you can get on this med with the apparent hardcore antimanic properties it has im not bipolar though,"depression, partial seizures",1

179,keppra why it affects memory keppra stimulates the actions of a natural brain chemical gaba i googled gaba and found the following in wikipedia with regard to the human brain it has been asserted that gaba signals interfere with the registration and consolidation stages of memory formation this is thought to be possible because the gaba system is found in the hippocampus an area of brain which has been implicated in memory formation just wanted to share this i know it doesnt make much of a difference but it is still interesting i have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and started taking keppra approx a year ago following a failed attempt to rely solely on lamictal changed to lamictal from depakote because i wanted to have a child anyway i can only say that i have managed to keep my seizures under control granted that i follow the strict schedule of med intake since keppra has such a short halflife hence no delaying dosages as for the sideeffects i suffer from poor memory i thought i was going senile and i am only 30 temper tantrums and mood swings however the latter i try to keep to a minimum by taking deep breaths and taking a philosophical outlook on life that doesnt always work though in a way the side effects that have come with keppra are better than those i had when taking depakote i would have a strange feeling as if walking around in a glass bell it is difficult to describe and horrible stomach problems my med of preference was lamictal with which i noticed no sideeffects possibly linked to its not working on a final note id like to say that i was relieved to read about others in a similar situation as mine and that many of you have experienced similar side effects i have told my neurologist about these and he tries to dismiss any critique of keppra hes writing a paper on it and is a big proponent of it,"epilepsy, mood swings, myoclonic epilepsy",1

202,new to this one will be updating later first impression of keppra was make it stop i went to a new neuro having been happy on phenobarbital for 5 years now complaining that the phenobarb was being hindered a bit by a new unrelated drug i started taking as i was forewarned it might well he said since im 25 now and phenobarb can oftentimes stop being as effective as you get older he wanted to put me on a new drug to supplement that being keppra first 2 weeks it felt like someone was taking an ice pick to my forehead from the inside for from around 3060 minutes after taking it to about 3 hours after i laid in bed with a pillow on my head crying because it just hurt so bad worse than my worst migraines had ever been i had to keep telling myself side effects go away they can go away and after a week they lessened after 2 weeks no more headaches whew relief as for what its doing for me so far i cant really saymy seizures havent lessened from it that i can tell but im also on that very low dosage still of 500 a day good thing im still on phenobarbital i do though appreciate the honesty of those 5 or so of trial patients that reported suicidal ideationit really felt like something that were i depressed by nature would tip me over the edge and make me just want to jump off a cliff frankly even in my heavy process of rationalization i wanted to at least toss that bottle over one so the side effects can get better i wouldnt give up so quick but if a doc starts you off high id see another doc to be totally frank as 250 at a time is quite enough adjustment to start,crying,1

216,horrible side effects i have simple partial seizures that were not controlled at all on keppra this is the worst medication at controlling my seizures that i have used and i have tried three others but the worst part was the side effects for me i became fatigued weak had frequent headaches didnt care about anything and developed depression i kept on it thinking that i would develop a tolerance like the other meds but this never happened in fact all of these symptoms got worse and worse i was on a spiral down after 2 months i was ready to die i also hit my husband in the head with a cereal box for no apparent reason we were just talking casually and he turned and i felt compelled to do this i was not mad at him and have never hit him before in my life there was loss of cognitive function as well i couldnt think anything through,"depression, frequent headaches, partial seizures",1
217,keppra no help as stand alone drug i used keppra alone for three months and it was totally ineffective it did almost nothing to control my seizures the only other drug i have taken that was less effective was depakote which didnt control my seizures at all what i did find out though is that keppra does have a benefit as a booster for felbatol by taking keppra in combination with felbatol i was able to reduce the dosage of felbatol i had to take and the side effects of keppra offset those of felbatol except aplastic anemia which you either do or dont get with felbatol if you go six months without your liver being damaged odds are you wont ever have a problem with it at all one other point the normal dosage of keppra is every 12 hours when used as a booster for felbatol taking it every eight hours works better when taking it every 12 hours the booster effect fell off after about 10 hours so i take the combination every eight hours with a dosage of 1000 mg each time for 3000 mg per day at first it was 4500 mg per day but i was able to reduce it to 3000 after going to the 3 times a day dosage instead of twice a day since there is almost no fall off in the first 8 hours,fall,1

291,i have been taking keppra for 4 12 years after head trauma from an auto accident caused me to have a seizure while in hospital i have experienced some minor occurances of side effects but nothing compared to the problem i experienced while taking dilantin which caused me to lose my ability to reason and to express myself ie dilantin made me an apparent idiot my greatest annoyance with keppra is the rise in cost 46 over these past 4 12 years,"accident, trauma",1
292,i think the definition of hell was the 4 weeks i was on this medication every single day i was constantly in a state of panic if youve had temporal lobe seizures you may know what im referring to the brief state of panic that occurs when a seizure is coming about i was in that state of panic all day i was in high school at the time and had to stay home nearly every single day the neurologist tried adding an antidepressant a xanax and nothing would calm it down when my hair began falling out at an alarming rate that was the final straw for me i had to demand to be switched to something else i take lamotrigine now and it has completely turned around my hair finally stopped falling out about 2 months after i quit the keppra,,0

426,havent been diagnosed yet but pretty sure i have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy jme this medicine did work very well for controlling the siezures i havent had a seizure while on it however the side effects are just about as terrible i was given 500mg twice daily and about two months in i would get pressure and tension feelings in my head while at school or in a social environment i assumed this was an aura of a seizure about to happen although with my particular case i never had an aura even before a seizure 10 months later and i have finally come to realize it was anxiety which made me feel as if i was going to have another seizure which only worsened the anxiety due to this intense seizure feeling i would take more doses of the keppra this led me to increasing the amount due to these symptoms i have pulled away from leaving my house two weeks ago i switched to 500mg keppra xr once a day started to suffer from actual panic attacks if you suffer with anxiety or quick temper i wouldnt recommend,"anxiety, aura, epilepsy, myoclonic epilepsy, tension",1

432,so i have taken keppra for 5 years it was the first medicine that the doctors started me on but unfortunately i still have seizures monthly i mostly have grand mals i have never woke up in a hospital with memory so then they upped the keppra to 3000 mgs also added lamictal upped it to 600 mg a day not counting my other meds its frustrating to never get any answers about any of it i also dont like the way it makes me feel since they always make me feel tired mean lightheaded and for at least 3 years of dealing with this i have issues with my vision driving etc had to get my glasses tinted so i can handle lights easier plus all the things im not able to do like swimming might drown going out skating anything to do with bright and or flashing lights several other things even with all the medicines they have me on i still have at least 1 a month no meds seem to help my issues luckily i have a wonderful seizure alert dog that stays with me everywhere is amazing at helping,,0
433,good for epilepsy but the feelings you get whilst taking them are so bad i have a feeling in my back of burning and on the inside also as if my tummy is burning also it is so good for fits if only on them a short while but not so good to be taken too long i wish my docs would understand what they are putting me through with this drug and how i feel but they do not understand or do not want to they just say so you know better than the doctors i know these drugs are doing me in and seeing dr about them so wish me luck phew,epilepsy,1

437,i was placed on keppra in january 2009 by an emergency room physician after a reported seizure which had no professional diagnosis a neurologist whom i saw post emergency kept me on the medication as i reported no side effects i had what i now believe to be a fainting spell related to an atrial fibrillation condition of my heart and a strenuous run without a cooldown i am pushing to get off this drug as i experience dizziness lightheadedness sleepiness and somnolence fatigue and exhaustion most of the time i am a 2008 herat valve transplant recipient and on diuretics and blood thinners both required to avoid congestive heart failure and embolismsartificial valve,"atrial fibrillation, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, lightheadedness, somnolence",1

445,keppra with vimpat and fycompa has been great for me we all know that it is hard to find the right combination of drugs every neuro i had diagnosed me with the wrong kind of seizures and therefore gave me the wrong meds i highly recommend video eeg monitoring to anyone who has seizures that cannot be controlled after thirty years they finally figured out my problem and i am now seizure free i truly wish all of you the best and hope that your seizures are controlled,,0
446,developed epilepsy due to several strokes while fighting sepsisseptic shock about 4 years ago i am in the middle of weaning off keppra and moving to lamictal while i was seizure free on keppra the kepprage depression and suicidal thoughts made me think it might be better to take my chances with seizureshopefully the lamictal will be effective i also with there was more science behind cannabis and i lived in a state that allows medical cannabis cbd seems like an option to supplement the conventional medications but i cant say i complain about the occasional buzz via full spectrum cannabis,"depression, epilepsy, shock",1
447,i was on keppra for about 6 months as an addition to oxcarbazepine from the first week of taking keppra i had developed a horribly annoying eye twitch at first i thought it was from lack of sleep but after about three months and the twitch being consistent on 34 days a week after a little research online i realized that keppra was the culprit besides the physical side effect my family told me i was just about unbearable with how moody i was while on it i was on the dosage of 250mg x2 my neurologist told me to give it 6 months to see it the side effects decreased over time before i reached the 6 month mark i had a break through seizure and that ended my journey with keppra,,0

498,been on this medication for over 15 years i suffer with epilepsy and several types of seizures would recommend keppra control and prevent upcoming seizures i would def recommend keppra for people suffering light seizures or epilepsy consuming medications daily to prevent attacks however you will not be able to rely on it during ur heavy attacks you would need diazepam rectal tube or seroquel to immediately calm u down within seconds advice pls take note to always have an emergency medication as when ur loved ones under a sever epilepsy attack u would be able to help them with diazepam rectal tube 5mg or seroquel tablet which immediately calms them down within seconds stops the hallu anxiety seizures and calms u down take note to only take it when needed as those medications are highly addictive if ur on keppra stick with it take note that it only helps prevent seizures and it has the least side effects no depression amazing,"anxiety, depression, epilepsy",1

517,ive been receiving this medication for years i take 1000mg twice a day since 1992 ive been taking this medication and for some reason when the bottle comes directly from the manufacturer theres never the right amount of medication in the bottle every bottle ive received from the cvs store is cut short one 2 tablets when this happens it throws my refill off by at least 2 days sadly now ill be short once more i received a letter stating my insurance will not be covering this script how in the world will i survive without my seizure medication currently take two different medication to keep my seizures under control can you please explain cvs says my script will cost over 1000 theres no way i can afford to purchase this medication,,0
518,keppra has been the only thing that controls my seizures it is dangerous at higher doses it gave me suicidal fantasies and a bi polar like personality when i lowered the dose i feel more stable with a joy for life but i am so fatigue 247 after taking it 20 years my memory is shot and i am scared i am going to get early onset dementia however an epileptic has to think about surviving each day without having a seizure in a dangerous circumstance that could kill or seriously injure themselves and others so although keppra is not perfect by any means and it will take a lot of experimentation for the right dose it gave me the best chance at a normal life seizure free,"dementia, fatigue",1
519,i had 5 what we think are seizures spread over three years each one resulted in the dislocation of one shoulder or the other all happened during the night i refused any medication over the first four episodes after the fifth i accepted a prescription for 500 mg tabs of levetiracetam to be taken twice a day morning and evening i purchased them but cut the tabs in half so i was taking only 250 mg twice a day this is half of what the md recommended after three years i have had no additional seizures dislocations of my shoulders so i guess it is working i have experienced none of the advertised side effects so i guess i am satisfied,,0

526,i tried lamotrigine twice unfortunately it caused very swollen lymph nodes with fever i took keppra 750mg twice a day for a few months my kidneys couldnt handle it i then stopped and tried again ended up taking 500mg twice a day i believe keppra does stop seizures to some extent although it causes side effects that are unbearable over time the biggest issues were personality changes i became a different human lacked empathy very moody and hardly happy i did have bouts of aggression but for me it was better than my previous aggressive issues before starting keppra couldnt complete tasks memory problems libido problems insomnia lots of trouble focusing i had no motivation lots of sadness my muscles ached i couldnt train at the gym as much as i did before i felt like i wasnt living my own life i felt the cost of controlling seizures are just too high it will work if you can live like a zombie,"aggression, insomnia",1
527,i had no option but to have the keppra dose reduced from 300mg to nothing over a period of two years as i suffered far too many side effects including bright red blood in my stools there were many other side effects too,,0
528,keppra has worked so far for the last 14 years when compared to the other 1 aed lamictal that ive been on its the better choice but if you are on it or about to start taking it make sure to look at other options whether your male or female keppra will negatively affect your sex life and will seriously impact your ability to reproduce i wasnt aware of this side effect until recently but it has affected me since i started as a result im now infertile also in todays society if sexual relations in a relationship are on the rocks a relationship will most likely end in at least 1 partner cheating also avoid lamictal as the fda has a warning on the sideeffects kidney disease it also causes cognitive impairment ie symptoms resemble those of dementia every 4 years i have to decrease the lamictal dose by 100mg due to the sideeffects klonazepam as well as any antidepression aed also can cause infertility,"cognitive impairment, dementia, infertility",1
529,i have been on keppra 500mgtwice a day for four years and havent had a seizure it was hard to adjust to and on days where im overtired the side effects can happen moodiness insomnia etc but ill take it and im so glad the seizures arent happening,insomnia,1

532,for us keppra was not the right medicine my son started on this medication at 6 months old and was on it till about 25 years old it didnt seem to help with seizures and also seemed to cause aggression issues once we removed this medication his over all attitude changed for the better i will say that while on it one thing that helped with the aggression was b6 vitamin,aggression,1

539,i was prescribed this drug after my first episode didnt have the second seizure until three years later after missing a couple of doses so i assume it worked well and i didnt suffer any physical side effects as my doctor kept monitoring the drug level through blood tests until she found the right amount however this drug literally made me a very horrible person a bad guy someone that i remember and i feel disgusted by i feel embarrassed i ruined some relationships and career opportunities i was put into ssris and they didnt help but made things worse i was in a rage all the time i call it kepprage after another violent seizure i was prescribed lamictal which counterbalanced keppras psychological side effect,"rage, violent",1

541,i was put on keppra and at first thought they were amazing as my grand mal seizures had just stopped its not what they do for epilepsy that should be debated with this medication its what they do to your mind i was sooooo depressed but had never been depressed before so i just let it go on and on until one night i tried to take my own life funnily enough with keppra if i was rating this medication on solely stopping seizures it would get a 10 but i think when theyre offering this out they should maybe balance it out with an anti depressant,epilepsy,1

619,i am 75 started using keppra in 2012 after a major seizure followed by several minor incidences of lost time i was unaware of my activities for over an hour accomplished regular tasks and awakened later unaware of what i had been doing these occurred many times but short duration doctors did all kinds of studies and threw the pill book at me gabapentin took away the creepy crawly stuff ropinirole helped with night time problems cpap helped but didnt improve keppra clearly helped it took a year to get the dose right but at 1250 mg two times per day leviteracetam i do quite well the doctor started me on 500 mg of keppra but the pharmacist apparently missed the dont substitute order since the lev worked so well in treating the symptoms i talked the doctor into leaving me on multiple pills of lower dosage rather than one higher dosage one argument was that lev is not as well formulated so not regular for consistency i do not experience any side affects that i can show are due to levetiracetam i am suffering still from some kind of lost time for a second or two every year or so but enough that i am not comfortable to drive 1 to 2 seconds at 50 mph caused a pretty severe accident i know of 4 or 5 times when these lost time incidents occurred and i did not fall asleep i was gone for about two seconds to discover bad things happening and decided plus the doctor ordered no more driving i also have a sleep deprivation problem and the two might be related the doctors have not been helpful attentive and order all kinds of tests but they have no idea what it is or they wont tell me,"accident, fall",1
620,i was having very strange episodes 1month of waking up to phantom odors becoming very nauseous and not remembering that i went to the bathroom thinking i was going to be sick also i would ask many questions about what was going on and since it was dark when this occurred i couldnt remember what my surroundings looked like this would all take place in just a few minutes my husband would talk me back to reality after tests it was classified as some nocturnal seizure this medication has worked with no side effects i started out with only onceday then increased to 2x since i had one small seizure with the smaller dose since increasing the dose i havent had any problems ,,0
621,prescribed following subdural hematoma after 10 months the side effects are horrible for me and my spouse my new neurologist calls keppra the most common cause of divorce he is aware of we are working hard to wean me off this drug,,0
622,i have taken levetiractetam for 12 years i was one of the very first people to start it when it was released back in the early 2000s in the uk before i started taking this medication i used to have regular petite mal seizures every 3 weeks periods of one day where i would have 10 fits in the same day then nothing for 34 weeks this all started back in 1992 when i had an operation to remove a abbess from my brain since i started this medication i have had 1 seizure so with regards to my actual epilepsy it has been a huge success however over the past 12 years i have noticed side effects that have come and go over the years such as bad mood swings i havnt been able to keep a steady relationship because of them they where very bad in the first 5 years of taking the medication but as time went on my attitude towards life changed and my mood swings vanished this could have something to do with me getting older and wiser rather than the medication itself also fatigue is a bad side effect especially now i have reached my late 30s and it seems to be getting worse i plan to go on an exercise plan this year to try and combat this also i get regular pains in my lower back which i believe are related to my kidneys and liver but my doctor says everything is fine in that department i am happy that this medication has kept me seizure free for so long but now that i am older i am worried about what long term implications it might have on me as i reach middle age,"epilepsy, fatigue, mood swings",1

625,ive been taking this for about a month now and this has really messed me up it does what its supposed to do but it makes me very irritable i have been showing signs of depression and it has significantly reduced my appetite to the point where i eat maybe 12 a week ive told my neurologist and hopefully i can get the dosage reduced because i refuse to take antidepressants,depression,1

631,i still get seizures and have even been in the er for a overdose caused by my doctor he had me taking too much of leveitracetam i changed doctors and my new one lowered me down on the dose but the seizures came back and he raised the dose back up so i am scared i will be back in the hospital from too many seizure again ive read where others are saying to stay away from the generic and stay with keppra i dont know if my insurance will pay for it i will talk to my doctor for help,overdose,1

645,ive had a lifetime of nighttime seizures only recently have they changed form to where i had a couple absence seizures in the first couple hours of my day ive only been on this medication for a week and a half so this review may be a bit premature here it is though i feel extra tired at times our main concern is this were not totally sure yet if this is related to the medication it seems there has been a decrease in my sex drive since starting the pill im not able to totally perform other than that everything seems okay,,0

647,age 75 had spells for the past 11 years and no one could diagnose them spells were brief but the last one was while i was driving coming to a stop light and i didnt stop no one hurt but went to neurologist and he prescribed generic keppra about one month ago a little dizzy and lethargic but no spells yet on 500 mg twice a day ,,0

652,the seizure control has been impeccable since starting it no seizures not even with lack of sleep flashing lights or caffeine however the side effects extreme anxietypanic irritability and depression have been so severe that after eight months i had to begin taking an antidepressant anti anxiety med to offset this i also have ongoing nasal issues which began after starting the levetiracetam since i want a safe medicine for my pregnancy i will stay on it after having babies though i will try to find something that does not alter my personality or outlook on life,"anxiety, depression, irritability, pregnancy",1
