it is almost too early for me to review but so far its been nothing but good no issues so far but its just under a week of me being on the drug no noticeable difference nothing shocking anyway regular marijuana user who was told to quit because of it and i see why now since being on this drug not the pot ive been sleeping better and it helps with the pot im aok with this as far as stopping seizures go so far so good but like i said it hasnt been long,,0
this medication has caused me not to be able to sleep be nauseated have blurred vision to the point of barely being able to read urinate very frequently it has made no difference in my seizures not a good medicine for me,,0
had a black out seizure and wreck a motorcycle two more black outs in a months time was prescribed two different seizure meds before this one no more seizures going on 5 yrs no side effects,,0
horrible my doctors have me on 700mg a day and i have had 2 accidental over doses because i was late taking the dose by maybe 45min to hour before i started taking this 4 years ago i didnt have any type of depression or anxiety issues i now have manic bipolar depression and server anxiety i have had 2 miscarriages because of this drug the doctor never let me know it was unsafe for conception so till they can ween me off and stabilize me with someone safer i cant have any childern if you have just a seizure condition i highly advise you not to take this pill,"anxiety, depression",1

i have been seizurefree for 5 years on the brand name medication lamictal xr due to an insurance coverage issue i am going to have to switch to the generic lamotrigine er and im petrified it wont work im a lawyer and losing my ability to speak and think clearly would make me lose my job if you can get the brand name get it i could not recommend a better medicine than lamcital xr for reference i started at 25 mgday and worked up to 200 mg which i was on for years i am 28 years old,,0
i have been on this medication for 7 months i have had a break through seizure taking 200mg a day now we have increased to 300mg a day i have hand tremors and muscle jerks my doctor calls the muscle jerks myclonic seizures i have nausea every morning i just dont think this medicine is the right one for me i dont see him again until july 3 months away but having to bring these issues to his attention he is not very easy to work with on getting the medication changed,nausea,1
im have been taking this drug for about 2 years and at first i was experiencing headaches but now im completely fine i take 200mg per day and it has done me good i havent had a seizure for about a year or so but i do have sudden moments of me blanking out to the point of me not being able to process anything but that has nothing to do with this drug,,0
i was having seizure activity for 5 yrs unknown to me i would pass outor so i thought and wouldnt know what happened i was diagnosed this year and this medication has worked wonderfully for me i am on 200mg a day and absolutely no seizures although my anxiety is a little worse this med changed my life,anxiety,1

i started this drug for seizures that i rarely have however i also suffer from depression and mood swings my doctor told me it would help with that as well i have never felt happier for the first two weeks of being on this drug my dose was upped a week and a half ago and im feeling a bit irritable but im very stressed out so that may be why i hope this starts to level off bc i absolutely loved it the first two weeks,"depression, mood swings",1
started taking tegretol and found it wasnt effective so the doctor changed my medication to lamotrogine and i have noticed a huge difference in the way i feel much better,,0

my doctor started me slowly with this drug increasing the dosage over 4 weeks i experience increasing tremors and weakness in my arms and legs to the point where i could not use my hands and had difficulty walking i am no longer taking this drug,,0

i was on lamictal but it became very expensive when the generic came out so i tapered down on lamictal and up on the generic to make sure i wouldnt have adverse reactions to the lamotrigine,,0
my dr started me on this med about 6 months ago and slowly raised my dosage to 400mg per day all total then on my last visit he advised me that we needed to double that amount new total of 800mg i took the first round of 800mg made it through that day fine very tired the next morning took the 2200mg pills 12 of my 800mg as instructed in less that 45 minutes i could not focus on anything then could not see where things were and to make matters worse i could not walk at all or even talk very well to try to explain to my fiance what was wrongthis lasted most of the day i am told the following day i called my dr and was advised to take it back down to a total of 375mg per day only this was very scary and not much scares me beware of the higher dosages,,0
i had one seizure in january 09 my doc put me on lamictal250mg started on the orange kit i dont feel any thing different now than i did before i took the meds he said that i have to be on the meds for 2 years to make sure i dont have another seizure i am not happy with thati am on the meds for antiseizure and it is very expensive i get the meds every three months at 80000 every three monthsthe doc will not let me take the gernic becaus of the different in the meds i talked to the pharmist and she said that there is a differents in active ingredianace and inactive and most people dont have any reaction,,0
i had lots of trouble finding a drug that would control my seizures without bad side effects i take 250mg bid and have no side effects my seizures are completely controlled and i am on single drug therapy,,0
my doc started me at 50mgs once daily and increase in one week to 2 tablets twice daily but i only made it 2 days and i started with side effects rash very ichy then my face lip and eyes started to swell then by the third day i trunned a bight red all over my skin i looked like a lobster i went back to my doc by this time and my feet had swelled my lypenods in my neck all inlarged and lets just say i had a very bad reaction to this med in a very short time frameit never really got a fare try but i dont really think my body was going to let it any way,rash,1
i have been using lamicatal for 5 years with very little seizure activity and almost not migraines but since switching to this generic i have been have some seizure activity not sleeping anxiety issues that my dr is testing to see if it is related to switching to the generic,anxiety,1
ive taken lamictal for maybe 5yrs now along with epilum frisium topamax lamictal was a great help with my seizures although it didnt stop them completely i get warnings however and if i take extra lamictal i can postpone the seizure for up to a day or 2 or stop it altogether even when i changed to the generic form it made no difference was just as effective and i experienced to sideeffects topamax which i have been on 18mths and am now stopping caused major depression and the lamictal did nothing to help the depression neither did prozac citalapram or venlafaxine,"depression, major depression",1
this drug has been the best ive ever been on however i may be starting to have some side effects that are bothering me,,0

less sedative side effects and horrid mood effects then previous medicationskeppra i have taken in fact none however because of a birth control pill i take for hormone regulation the efficacy of lamotrigine is reduced totally opposite of other medications i just had another generalized seizure 4 days ago i spent 8 hours the er with tachy arrythmias and intermittant seizures i previously told my neurologist about the medication interaction in mid august and he never increased my lamotrigene which is supposed to be increased 2 fold especially because the np who prescribed the hormone medicine made a point of telling me to follow up with my neurologist now i cant drive for 6 monthsha haand that neurologist just displayed his incompetence to me he can pay for my medical bills now i already refuse to see one of his colleagues because the other doc refused to change me from tegretol years ago and the end result landed me in the er at the hospital i worked at and had my privacy violated i was discriminated against by my supervisor after she accessed my medical records and reported me to employee health i have a long list of other ailments my seizures are usually the least of my worries since that incident i have had a hard time with employers i cant stand the response i get from them when they hear about my seizures amongst other things i always get very hostile when questioned because i am the mind that i am still standin in spite of it all,,0
i have had great success with this medication my last seizure was in 2003 and i have not had one since and have not had any side effects,,0
i was a long time user of mebaral 50 yrs until it was discontinued i switched to phenobarbital and experienced a couple auras and balance issues i switched to keppra which stopped working 8 months later with a 6 hour long aura now im on 200mg of lamotrigine twice a day not because i was having an incident but because my tests showed i was at the low end of the acceptable range i have experienced balanced issues sometimes walking like a drunk and using obstacles to keep my balance driving anxiety especially at higher speeds dry mouth occasional double vision slight hand tremors difficulty writing and remembering words i feel stupid and slow i feel that my quality of life has greatly diminished and is very limiting because i havent had an incident my doctor believes these side effects are okay and there is no need to consider changing to some other drug my last seizure was when i was 16,"anxiety, aura, dry mouth",1
i had been taking dilantin for over 30 years and still had partial seizures a few days a month i started taking lamotrigine a few years ago and hardly have any seizure activity at all i had a severe head injury as a result of an auto accident now my life is almost back to normal i dont have any side effects that i notice and am very happy my doctor urged me to try this ill probably be taking it forever but thats ok its nice not living with the fear of seizures,"accident, fear, head injury, injury, partial seizures",1
i have had auras for decades after experiencing a grand mal seizure on april 12th i learned that my auras were seizures they were nothing more than an odd feeling and a metallic taste in my mouth i have been taking the generic form of lamictal lamotrigine since june 18th i began with 50 mg per day i was having breakthrough seizures so im now taking 100 mg per day i have been seizurefree since august 4th my only concern is that i feel stupid at times unable to find the right word,,0
i was taking keppra but experienced breakthroughs like that whoosh you feel before a grand mal dr is adding lamotrigine and i thought it was going to be the answer until i had to drive and never felt so anxious i had to hold my breath the whole trip and couldnt wait until i got home im just now building up to 100 am and 100 pm,,0

my nephew has had several seizutes he has autism and has always had anger issues he was prescribed keppra which has been a disaster for his behavior switched him to this med several weeks ago no seizures since i can tell a big difference when hes taken the kepprahes down to 150mg of that when hes had his lamictal hes much calmer slower to anger and when he does get angry he calms down much faster i really resent the people that trash this drug because they or a person they knew had a bad reaction different people react differently to different medications it does not mean that it should be taken off the market or that people that it works well for should be belittled there are people whom this drug could work well for who will read the shrill it should be taken off the market or its poison or why would anyone take this drug and not even take a chance on it because of the people that overreact it does a real disservice to those people to the person that said theyve never heard a good thing about this drug theyre are plenty of good reviews here along with the bad just like on every drug there is,"anger, autism",1

my trigeminal neuralgia started in 1996 as the result of a severe undiscovered infection caused by a corroded silver pin used during a root canal when i was 11 years oldi am a language teacher and singer and went through some excruciating days using ice packs heat etc doctors just kept wanting to give me pain killers and all the dentists i went to kept telling me they could see nothing wrong meanwhile the abscess was eating through my jaw bone after it was finally big enough to be discovered about 10 12 monthsand xrays got more precise and the abscess was taken care of it went away for 20 years i then moved and found a new dentist who did not listen to me he made a night guard for the wrong area of my mouth and the tgn started again had two very severe attacks in 2017 and i have been using carbamazepine as needed when i feel twinges i have been very lucky i want to let you know about an organic essential that was introduced to me in a healthnatural store you roll it on the outside of the area causing the pain and i have found it to be extremely helpful it is veriditas by pranarom and is called just plain relief yes thats plain with an l i take two 200 mg grams of carba twice a day and if i do get a spasm i roll this on i find it very soothing and considerably helpful i certainly hope you find the right combination that will work for you,"abscess, infection, neuralgia, pain, trigeminal neuralgia",1
been taking this for seizures and recently for bipolar i also have adhd but on adderall for that and then klonopins for panic attacks carbamazephine has worked for me for my seizures due to years of abusing opiods id have to agree with some of the ppl here also have trouble with learning new trades decreased drive and sometimes tiredness antisocial not too much on weight gain theres probably few more my apologies ill try to repost them hoping itll help at least 1 person or more overall at the moment tho for my seizures i havent scared my gf for 2 yrs and couple months my nationality is asian age 38 usual routine on life started with mary j and then drinking smoke cigarettes for 23 years and started vaping to quit not sure if im goin off subject but basically everyones different and the medications have their ups and downs so for me my seizures were the reason im on them and id like to stop taking carbamazephine eventually looking into a little more natural remedies cbd oils lol im hoping tho the rules and regulations arent set well for that yet here but we dont live for ever also so try and hopefully this carbamazephine works or doesnt for whoever took time to read this i pray you find a lil peace of mind from what ever youve endured to get here whichevr or whoever your godbless,,0
i have used carbamazepine er for 30 years and it has worked well except for 2 seizures 14 years ago which i attribute to the change i had to increase my doseage to a total of 1100mgday split between morning and evening i have had some memory loss but that started just after my first seizure when i was 35 and was told it was brain disintegration cant think of the right word finding words is sometimes difficult but cant know if it is the medication or the state of my brain after the seizure every 3 weeks or so i have an aura where i cant follow conversation or process information well it ends with a headache so i know it is going away if often lasts all day and i may wake up with it i dont know if that means less control by the medicine or not at least i have not had any seizures for 14 years the only really bad thing is that this drug is part of a class of aeds that cause bone loss after all of these years i have severe osteoporosis and broke my arm after a bad fall the surgeon had to pin everything together and said my bones were weaker than he had anticipated considering i may have at least another 20 years to go i am considering changing to another drug that does not affect bones however all of the reviews i have read on those lamotrigine vimpat topirimate and leviracetam are very scary taking fosamax for my bones is not the answer apparently since i had been doing that for a number of years anyone with any info on this is very appreciated i suggest all long term users to have bone density tests every 2 years even the men,"aura, fall, headache, memory loss, osteoporosis",1

for a year i have been treated for tmj but i have such intense pain that i would rather die that my husband made me go to our family doc about it he said he thinks its trigeminal neuralgia sent me to ent who agreed he sent me for mri and to neurologist who also agrees it tri neuralgia now on carbamazepine which seems to help but only been on it for 3 weeks neuro wants to change that to gabapentin but side effect reviews for that scare me i havent had any pain since 1219 so hoping its working my pain comes whenever night or day and lasts anywhere from 12 hr to 2 hrs would rather go thru childbirth with no assistance than this pain im hoping someone finds an effective cure for this because its ruining my lifeafraid to do anything or go anywhere because it starts out of nowhere dont want to embarass myself or my husband so glad he loves me and helps me through the pain just by holding me and letting me cry on his shoulder til it passes sorry but cant help but crydont want to but automatically tears come,"neuralgia, pain, trigeminal neuralgia",1

carbamazepime worked very well for me over the years the only problem was that over the years my neurologist had to increase my dosage every couple of years my neurologist told me that carbamazepime was a drug that strangely tends to build up an immunity to itself so the longer that you take it the less effective it becomes over the years i dont know how many people in which this effect tends to happen but if you are having to increase your dosage every so often its most likely that the problem is the one i described im now trying other anticonvulsants but have not yet really found one that works,,0

i have had migraine headaches since i was a preschooler for as long as i can remember i have suffered with migraine headaches sometimes three to four times per month and each occurence could last up to three days i would be hypersensitive to light and noise my head would ache severely on my left side i would be nauseous and sometimes dizzy and miserable from the feelings of helplessness i struggled through elementary and high school and persevered through the agony tylenol aspirin ibuprofen did nothing to lessen the pain it was after my family doctor tried me on many other alternatives that he suggested sumatriptan i was in my late 20s it was a lifesaver it is the only medication that has taken away my migraines i just turned 60 and although the frequency of my migraine attacks has reduced the intensity remains the same sumatriptan works every time to take the pain and symptoms away i honestly do not know how i could live on today if it were not for sumatriptan the negligible side effects are transient and insignificant compared to the migraine pain from what i understand it does not work on some people who claim to have headaches all i can suggest is that their headaches may not be actual migraines but possibly some other headache that sumatriptan is not designed to treat if it doesnt work for you that doesnt mean that it doesnt work for others it saved my life and my sanity,"ache, headache, migraine, pain",1
incredible lifesaver from early onset of a migraine to feeling no pain at all even blissful relaxed calm this completely eradicates my worst migraines within 3040 minutes leaving me feeling amazing wish i knew about it sooner,"migraine, pain",1
at first it seemed to work but its like a hit and miss now its more of a miss i instantly feel very sick and then sometimes my migraine will go away but with the nausea i really dont like this medication anymore,"migraine, nausea",1
,,0
definitely worth a try,,0
this drug has improved the quality of my life greatly after years of taking t3s to make it thru the day and they just knocked the edge off the headachesi tried sumatriptan and it works with no side effects dont let your headache get out of control if you feel one take one immediatlytakes about an hourafter 30 years of pain this has changed my life for the better,"headache, pain",1
this really is a miracle pill my grandpa dad and myself all suffer from the same type of migraines we have aura symptoms our face and body goes numb for about 2030 minutes then the piercing cluster headache pains kick in followed with intense vomiting i took sumatriptan with my last migraine spell and let me tell you i still had a light headache but my numbness vanished and i didnt vomit once i was able to sleep the rest off no crazy side effects either so thankful for these,"aura, cluster headache, headache, migraine, numbness, vomiting",1
within ten minutes of taking this medication i had nausea vomiting and diarrhea the headache went away but it was traded for the above issues,"headache, nausea, vomiting",1
i suffer from cluster headaches and migraines i just started taking this medicine yesterday it is effective for me in controlling the pain about an hour after taking it my head pain is gone that last for about 6 hours before i need another one 50mg what i do not like are the side effects i experience intense tingling and tightening in my upper neck shoulders and arms that is very uncomfortable,pain,1
i was lucky to find that sumatriptan works very well for me in regard to migraines i used to wait to take it to make sure i had a real migraine as opposed to a headache i learned finally not to wait the earlier the better the results are quick under an hour and the side affects are minimal even if i wake up with a migraine i can take this and get on with my day perhaps not at 100 but certainly good enough to get things done,"headache, migraine",1
prescribed sumatriptan 50mg took one with 2 ibuprofen at 2000 no effect another at 0430 no effect and a third at 1000 with 2 paracetamol no effect by 1130 i had to ring my pharmacist i thought my head was about to implode my fingers numb and my speech slurred sumatriptan appeared to aggravate my migraine and was completely ineffective,migraine,1
sumatriptan has been a miracle drug for me i typically wake up with a migraine i take one 100mg pill and drink a cup of caffeinated coffee and almost every time that awful headache is gone i sense no side effects it just works if you are a migraine sufferer and you have hesitated to ask a doctor about this drug wait not one day longer i hope it works for you just as it works for me,"headache, migraine",1
i honestly love this medication so much i have been plagued with migraines for over 10 years now and nothing ever worked i spent most of high school and late teens trying to deal with the pain until my doctor prescribed sumatriptan to me a year ago i get 9 100mg pills but 100mg is too much so i break them in half which is nice cause it gives me 18 pills my pharmacist says they work best when you take lots of water so i at the onset of a migraine i try to take them with a full glass plus its good to stay hydrated when you have a migraine anyways it works within an hour and my migraine is gone i do get some muscle soreness throughout my entire body which lasts about 4 to 5 hours afterwards but after a year ive adjusted to it and its honestly way easier to deal with then a migraine i love sumatriptan so much and it has saved me so many times from having to go to work and endure the intense pain of a migraine or having my plans ruined because i have to stay in bed all day the only problem is ive become so reliant on this medication that when i get down to my last pill if i dont have time to get my refill i get really anxious luckily 1 prescripton lasts at least 3 to 4 months,"migraine, pain",1
i have been using this drug for year and have had much success with it since they only give you 9 in a bottle i try to take a half a pill as soon as i feel a migraine coming on and most of the time that works since it is generic for imitrexit is much cheaper too i used to take butalbitalfiorinal spand didnt like the way they made me feel prefer this much better,migraine,1
after 18 years of suffering from migraines i was newly prescribed sumatriptan and it has been helping tremendously i have decided to rely largely more on a new diet plan exercise moderation therapy herbs and other natural remedies even thou the side effects are a bit crazylike tiredness body tightness dizzyness nauseous and full on body heatits wayyy better than that ongoing extreme pain and having to go to the er missing out on work and life usually takes about 1hr to 1 12 hrs to work and sometimes it doesnt fully go away but the pain is reduced if you suffer from migraines too i would request you try this out,pain,1
usually stops pain of migraine within 1 hour 12 but does not stop other symptoms works 95 of time a life saver after many years of nothing that releived the pain,"migraine, pain",1
this pill initially works to rid my migraine but by the end of the day its back worse so i have to take another which works maybe 50 of the time then i go to bed and wake up in the middle of the night with another rebound migraine its 5050 again if it will work side effects are nausea unless i eat something with it im extremely hot and sweaty a general feeling of just feeling bad,"migraine, nausea",1
works at least 85 of the time easy to take orally the very small pills nothing else i have ever taken including powerful narcotics has ever worked nearly as effectively and consistently as sumatriptan my doctor told me that it could make me feel a little dizzy after the first few minutes of it taking effect particularly when standing up from a sitting or laying down position but for me there has been zero dizzy spells i have been taking it for years the only side effect i have on rare occasion experienced is a slight nausea that lasts for up to 3 hours but compared to the nausea and pain of the migraines the infrequent and minor level of nausea i have experienced is rather insignificant,"dizzy spells, nausea, pain",1
generic sumatriptan is great if you can find the aurobindo brand almost every pharmacy in my city has switched to the dr reddy brand and dr reddy brand does not work at all i seriously do not think there is any sumatriptan in the dr reddy brand and they must have offered all the pharmacies a lower price than aurobindo because everyone is suddenly only selling dr reddy brand i would pay more for aurobindo if i can ever find it again,,0
i usually take a 14 of a 100 mg pill and it will work within 2030 minutes this has been the best pain relief i have ever had i dont usually need to repeat the dosage if i take it fairly quickly after the onset of the migraine excellent medication,"migraine, pain",1
have suffered from monthly migraines for over 10 years horrible pain and this med actually works although considerably sleepy and need to take as soon as i feel one coming on,pain,1
this medication definitely works on my headache the side effects that i experience include extreme fatigue runny nose hot flashesand trouble concentrating i still like it better than having the migraine i only take a half a pill,"fatigue, headache, migraine",1
when it starts to work my migraine gets worse before it gets better usually within the hour of taking it then the side affects start the nerves in my body tingle for about 23 hours my throat may or may not swell a little bit for awhile but overall but im good after 12 hours its definately better than having a migraine,migraine,1
this absolutely got rid of my headaches the reason i give it a 3star satisfaction rating is because of the resulting side effects for me anyway my migraines hit in the middle of the night so when i take this med its usually a couple hours before i get up for the day when drinking my morning coffee it feels like its scalding as it goes down my throat and believe me my morning joe is almost like a milkshake with the amount of cream i add its not straight black my skin also feels ultrasensitive almost like i have a mild sunburn but again this is just my experience at least my head doesnt hurt,sunburn,1
works very strangely as it makes all my aura symptoms come at once which is horrible for about 10 minutes but after that im totally fine although really drowsy so still need to sleep all day still get migraine hangovers so feel off for a few days overall its a million times better than other medication ive tried,"aura, migraine",1
i have been getting cluster headaches for over 25 years when i am in a cluster i get at least 3 headaches a day for around 4 weeks headaches last 1hour to 24 hours this is the only medication that gives me any relief 100 mg works within 15 to 30 minutes with no noticeable side effectsim not sure what the dangers are for taking more than 400 mg a week as indicated on the limitations but in the moment i dont care so far i have taken 700 mg this week and expect more coming i have searched for info on dangers of taking too much but found nothing suppose i need to contact the pharmacy,,0
it definitely works for me but it makes me so dizzy and slow and i almost feel like a zombie if i can lay in a dark room and sleep it off i feel that it works best,,0
this is the only rx medication ive tried so far i get migraines every 45 days that last about 24 hrs initially i thought this was a wonder drug i could finally get some relief and feel like a normal person however a few months in i realized about 2024 hours after taking the pill i was getting a rebound migraine this began a vicious cycle only allowed 10 pills a month and having to take one immediately at onset to turn around and have another the next day just didnt work i would end up running out 2 weeks into the month and being miserable until i could get more on to the next one,migraine,1
i used to suffer days waking up and going to sleep with migraines until my doctor decided to try this on me i am able to function and not have to take off work because of it any longer now i just have to get my insurance to realize i need these and they should be paying their part why have insurance coverage if you cant get what you need,,0
it makes my headaches worse and the side effects are scary my chest feels tights my neck becomes stiff and my head throbs worse than it did before i went to take it,,0
medicine has not been working for me i suffer with migraine headaches everyday i go to bed with them and i wake up with them i cant stand light heat sound and being around talking or lots of people suck with insurance only allowing 9 pills i dont see how i can even really see if this medicine will work,migraine,1
does not work for me i hate being a guinea pig for meds but am willing to try everything until something relieves my migraines,,0
this medication has allowed me to actually be able to function for the most part when one strikes does not alleviate all symptoms but is far better than a trip to the er,,0
side effects are worse than the actual migraine,migraine,1
i been taking sumatriptans for 30 years this has always worked for me i agree that the insurance companies should give more than 9 pills a month,,0
i have massive migraines just about every day and this medicine has not helped in relieving or easing my headaches,,0
this is the worst brand of sumatripan i have ever taken lowers the pain but does not get rid of the pain,pain,1
sumatriptan allows me to continue on with my day after a migraine hits its the best migraine med ive ever tried i get up to 2 migraines with aura a week and now i can actually function after one starts yey,"aura, migraine",1
i have had similar issues like others my insurance wont allow me to get enough medication each month to cover all of my migraine headaches this problem really needs to be remedied,migraine,1
reduced the headache to an acceptable level it made me feel little tired not too bad though i also become very sensetive to heat i feel my hands burning just washing them in warm water for those who get migraines warm hands and little tiredness are nothing compared to the headache,headache,1
this is not a miracle drug but after 11 years of migraines i came across it and it helps a lot i rely largely on diet exercise moderation acupuncture herbs and other natural remedies but sumatriptan is a great drug and my life is better for it,,0
the treatment for my cluster migraines has been very effective i had not had them for 4 years and this medication is far better than the last one i had the problem is that the pharmacy insurance caremarkcvs would not refill my prescription as 9 tablets were supposed to last for 30 days not i spent the morning on the telephone to caremark customer service and the very nice yet uninformed lady agreed to a refill without paying 154 for 9 tablets in future she said that any refills must have prior authorization my doctors office was very agreeable to that and said that when i get down to 6 tablets to give them a call and they would take care of ittime will tell on that part i will make quite sure to call on a monday so that everyone has the allotted 2472 hours to manifest the operation quelle merde times have changed since i was a child and my parents knew all of the doctors who would drop anything including a cocktail to make a house call or a pharmacy call after i was married it was the cold cruel world no longer insulated by my magic doctors it continues to be annoying i have a very accommodating doctor one of my prerequisites and i am preservering to obtain the same from my insurer incidentally i too have fibromyalgia migraines and fibro are related through the mutual symptoms imbalance nerve pain etcetera,"fibromyalgia, pain",1
relieves nerve pain for migraine and fibromyalgia,"fibromyalgia, migraine, pain",1
works great but my insurance company united healthcare thinks they are the perscribing physican and will only give me 4 pills a month i have more than 4 migraines a month i have to sometimes cut them in half,,0
i have been taking this drug 50 mg to treat migraine for about 3 years now within 2 hours of taking a pill i have my life back and the migraine has completely gone i call it my miracle pill and have had no side effects whatsoever,migraine,1
i would take this at the first sign of a migraine and every time i ended up with a worse headache than priori do not think this works for me,"headache, migraine",1
does the job but now i am going to doc to see if it is causing my heart palpitations,palpitations,1

i have been on this medication for 7 months because my regular meds became too expensive takes between 1 to 2 hours to take the migraine away my regular migraine medication only took 15 minutes to work i get light headed for about 30 minutes but it works better than nothing at all the pill quantity each month will depend on which insurance carrier you have i am only allowed 18 pills per month,migraine,1
have been given this in 100mg dosage 2x50mg to help stop my constant migrines after severe hemiplegic migraine several months ago they seem to take the edge off for 24 hours then usualy i will need to take another dosage so overal i think they are not very good at all will b asking specailist for somthing else asap,migraine,1

i have been suffering from migraine headaches since i was about 18 im 30 now this is the first time where ive taken a medication that made me feel worse after taking than before my prescription is for 100mg and about 2030 minutes after taking a pill i become incredibly dizzy i usually have to lie down until the world stops spinning i become nauseous and my body is achy on the bright side this is the only medication ive ever taken that has zapped my migraine every time it takes about an hour or so after taking a dose and then poof my migraine is gone i use this as a last resort though because i do not like the way i feel for that hour between taking the pill and when the migraine goes away if i know i can take a nap while the pill works its magic then i take it if im stuck at work however i try to use some other form of treatment overall im happy with this medication but i wish i didnt feel so dizzy and naseous after taking it,migraine,1
i have had migranes for 40 years was taking maxalt but switched to this one due to the cost of maxalt relieved my migrance but am only allowed 9 pills per month maxalt i was allowed 12 why the pill restriction,,0
i just started having migraine headaches and this was the second one that i have had and nothing was working for it after 7 days dr gave me this and in about an hour it was gone,migraine,1
i have had migraines since i was a young child i was prescribed sumatriptan to help eleviate my awful headaches i was weary to try this medication knowing all the awful side effects last night i took 25mg within 30 minutes i feel awful my jaw became very stiff my arms felt limp and tingly and felt like i had weights on them to go along with that my cheast neck and shoulders felt very tight and heavy my headache actually got worse this prescription says that a common side effect is drowsyness well it had an adverse affect on me and i was awake until 4 am with work the next morning i would caution if using on a work night i would highly recommend if taking this drug for the first time to make sure you dont need to be up at the crack of dawn i am overall glad i tried this one more thing i know doesnt help i feel this drug either works wonders or stabs you in the back today my stomach hurts and it has been hard eating much of anything as i feel it will all come back up hope this review helps,headache,1
it is working for me with 50 mg dose the only side effect i have got is funny feelings in my stomach which usually go away pretty fast great drug,,0
i experience 4 or 5 migraines per week and have tried many different drugs this works better than any i have tried with no noticeable side effects it usually knocks it out in about an hour about once a week i have to take a second dose my biggest problem is that i finally find something that works and my insurance will only pay for 9 per month theyll pay for other drugs that cost 4 or 5 times as much and dont work but not these welcome to the us health care system,,0
it is a miracle for me i wake up once in a while having slept wrong on my neck causing a terrible headache that no other meds can touch this medicine takes it right away,headache,1
took the medication at about 3pm for a migraine that ive had for the last 3 days about 20 minutes after dosing it felt like an elephant had sat on my body every muscle in my body hurt my throat became extremely painful and my head still hurt after about 1 hour my nose started bleeding which lasted for about 1015 minutes still have my migraine although it is not as severe now however i dont think ill ever take another of these pills again the side effects just arent worth the trouble next time ill just go to my dr and get a shot for my migraine,migraine,1
didnt touch my migraine even after 2nd dosing,migraine,1
it works great for migraines however every time i use it my neck gets real stiff my chest feels like its going to cave in and my body aches for about an hour i only use the medication as a last resort,,0
i have been using this drug to treat my migraines for almost four years i have had migraines since i was 19 im now 52 no other treatment worked for me within one hour of taking the 50 mg pill the headache is totally gone i have never had any side effects either it doesnt get any better than that,headache,1
depending on the severity of the headache the pain will go away sometime between 30 minutes and 2 hours but it always takes away my headache about 30 minutes after taking it my entire body becomes sore almost like ive worked our extremely hard and my hole body is bruised everything hurts from my tongue to the bottoms of my feet but no headache this lasts about 6 hours then im fine,"headache, pain",1
i have had strong head aches for years finaly went to the dr today took this pill and was relieved of a headache three day headack within 20 minutes thank you god,headache,1

this brings relief within 30 minutes of taking it the most noticed side effect is a slight sore throat,,0
as soon as the pain begins i take one pill and rest if possible usually it will relieve most of the discomfort,"discomfort, pain",1
i was shocked 2 months ago and since then i have had really bad migraines i was given this to see if it would help but it kept me up all night and i have horrible stomach pains this medicine does not work for me,,0

i took it for a while but i would get more nauseated while on the medication it would only work for me if i went home took it and went to sleep i would always take it with alieve,,0
i have been taking this medication for a few days but it is really not very effective when you have really elevated pain levels,pain,1
i am a long time migrainer and know my triggers menopause certainly reduced my headaches identifying the key signs of migraine and rapid treatment is the key to my treatment migraines increase with delay,"menopause, migraine",1
my neuro gave this to mebut only 9 pills a month if i need to take two for a really bad episode and i usually have more than 4 in a month i have to suffer the rest of the timewith out anything,,0
i have suffered with migraines since i was a teenager tried several different prescription drugs with little or no effect on them until imitrex came onto the market a wonder drug the pain nausea hypersensitivity would disappear within an hour i took it for over a decade with no problems then my insurance company changed coverage so only the generic form was covered the first only time i took the generic version i had anaphylaxis had to be rushed to the hospital resulting in 1000s of dollars in medical bills am appealing to the insurance company along with my doctor to try to be able to return to the namebrand imitrex but in the meantime i have no meds cant afford retail,"hypersensitivity, nausea, pain",1
i do not suffer from migraines i suffer from cluster headaches if i take one of these pills at the very onset of a headache the headache is gone within 15 20 minutes the only drawback is the rebound headache i get from aborting the cluster headache is twice as bad as the original headache the only negative thing i can say about this medication is the cost my insurance covers it as a tier 3 the quantity allowed is 8 pills in a 25 day period this would be fine for migraine use but for cluster headaches not a good thing because we can have up to 3 o 5 episodes a day my copay is 69 for 8 pills and the overall cost is close to a whopping 500 for 8 pills,"cluster headache, headache, migraine",1
i have been having migrans for almost 35 ears have had test after test done be on more drugs than i can count the doctor put me on this drug as long as i catch it in the early stages its gone within 15 minutes if i wait to long it take about two hours with a good nap love this pill and i tell everyone about it,,0
i have been getting migraines since i was 5 years old ive even had mris done of my brain to see if they found a visible causing source always came up short i would get them all the time due to a severe msg allergy just recently 1 week ago my doctor perscribed sumatriptan succ and i had a horrible day at work this past saturday literally cried my eyes out for the first hour i was there i was already nasueated and then the crying set on a headache which then would have built up to a migraine without reading the back of the bottle i swallowed a dose and then noticed it may cause dizziness and drowsiness so then i ate an apple attempted to help out some of my coworkers w our job and then i suddenly felt elsewhere like i knew i was at work but i didnt feel like i was there i didnt even feel like i was in my own body i told my supervisor and manager and they both said well we have plenty of staff on right now go take a 30min break so i did sat outside did some meditative breathing after 30 min past i came back inside and was freezing then like 3 people told me you dont look so goodmaybe you should go home so i called my boyfriend and he picked me up went home took a bath and a nap awoke feeling completely revived it was just the initial experience of my body trying to recognize what i just induced also fighting off the drowsy and i felt so lost within myself my boyfriend even told me my eyes were glassy and all over the place so i would suggest for me anyways to only take this drug if you have nothing planned for the next couple hours i wouldnt suggest taking this at the office or whereever you happen to be employed i hope this review helps some of you,"crying, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, migraine",1
i was given the generic version of imitrex it helped somewhat but i have had to take a second dose and still dont have full relief of the migraine the makers ohm laboratories should note that the pill is so vile tasting that it brought about another round of vomiting not what the migraine sufferer wants to encounter,"migraine, vomiting",1
doctor gave it for migrains,,0
seems to work well if taken at earier onset of migraine,migraine,1
i have experience migraines for atleast 25 yrs i have taken alot of medications for these i have taken midrin sumatriptan amerge imitrex and zomig over the years the last medication i was taking was zomig of all the meds amerge imitrex zomig worked the best i have just this year turned back to the generic brand because of insurance change and the other medicine were going to cost to much the name brand worked the best for me and am somewhat disappointed that i can no longer get that because of cost i am happy that there is affordable treatment for this as before i would ration my med and take only when i really needed to be able to function i just have to make sure that i take this med early as possible when i feel migraine coming on in order for this to relieve symptons,migraine,1
i have suffered migraines for years other medications did not stop the migraine completely and still left me feeling nausea and quite illi then bought imigran tablets from the chemist as advertisedtwo tablets cost 8 wow they are amazingwithin an hour i feel a lot better i do not have to take time off work they are my life line thank you to who ever invented sumatriptan,"migraine, nausea",1
took the first dose at the onset of a migraine i felt better but then felt like it was coming back after 2 hrs i took a second dose of sumatriptan and it got better but did not go awaymaybe im just disappointing that it did not go completely awaybut it did help relive the pain significantly,"migraine, pain",1
i have used this medication since its fda approval it has been a true god send for me i have no idea what i would have done without it certainly i would have not been able to continue my employment throught to retirement,,0
i was switched to this about 9 months ago its much more effective than the old medication however it makes me extremely tired and have to urinate a lot during the day after i take it i also get tingling in my jaw and weird sensations in my handsfeet if they get too cold or hot but i can live with that over a migraine,migraine,1
i have been a migraine sufferer since i was a teenager and was given everything under the sun to alleviate them suffering even through pregnancies not able to take anything about 15 years ago when i was in my 30s a very good doctor introduced me to imitrex and boy did the sun begin to shine again because of insurance i take the generic form now i still think the brand works better but im still happy when the pain goes away,"migraine, pain",1
i have been experiencing migraines for 12 years and i was never diagnosed until last summer my doctor then put me on this medication my only complaint is that i get severe nausea 45 minutes after taking the drug otherwise the migraines are guaranteed to go away im so glad i found an end to my suffering,nausea,1
after being on maxalt and midrin which was taken off the market this is phenomenal i have constant light sensitivity with almost an impending headache at all times it helped with the multiple areas of pain for my migraines,"headache, pain",1
migraine sufferer for years nothing helpeddiscovered this medicine through a trial clinicbest chance i ever took never leave home without itusually takes 1 to 2 hours to take full effectwith no side effectsrarely do i need a second dose,migraine,1
i have been taking this drug for about 15yrs in 50mg doses it has never let me down my migraines are not as severe as others experience i never have nausea or loss of vision mine consist of a severe pain running from the back of my neck over the top of my head to my brow always on one side only,"nausea, pain",1
i have been using this medication for a long time and i would say that it is a miracle drug once it has kicked in i am able to resume normal activities as if i didnt have a migraine i couldnt survive without it,migraine,1
this is absolutely the best stuff i used to have really bad migraines and i wish i had imitrix then but my headaches are minor now so i take only 25mg at a time and it works like a charm a family member takes it also and functions wonderfully on it no side affects to my low dosages,,0
the sumatriptan that was given to me loosely in a bottle is different than the foil pack according to my pharmacist i became very ill after my pharmacy filled my sumatriptan prescription with the white round tablet instead of foil pack when checking with the pharmacy i found that the nonfoil tablets contain sulfa which i am highly allergic to therefore i became very ill,,0
i have been suffering from migrains doe as long as ai can remember this medicine is a miracle i dont know what i would do without it,,0
this medicine works great for me and is such a relief i take one 100 mg tablet and it can almost always completely eliminate the migraine even when it is full on rarely i will take two it usually takes a while to start working 3045 min i will feel no relief at all for the first 30 minutes then i start to feel a tightness in my jaw right after this side effect happens the migraine is usually completely gone in just a few minutes this works considerably better than anything ive tried in the past i do not get nausea or fatigue or any alteration of mental state on this drug other than the temporary jaw sensation i get no side effects at all and can continue my day as usual,"fatigue, migraine, nausea",1

im a va hospital patient and the va changed me to this about 5 months ago so far it seems to work as advertised only 1 time a headache came on faster than the pill could work then the only relief is a trip to the hospital i have only needed 1 pill 99 of the time recently my headaches have been increasing in frequency but the sumatriptan has been for the most part kept them at bay i have never had side effects not even bieng tiredsleepy pretty happy so far,headache,1
this pill has changed my life it does work best right at the onset of the migrainewipes it right out i do have side effectsmakes me very tired for a couple of hours and i have tightening of my jaw and some muscle tighteningalso can not touch hot water it feels like it is burning me it is so much better than the brutal hell headaches i used to get that would last for days,,0
the medication works well to get rid of my migraine but it makes me sick to my stomach i have to take a nausea med along with it,"migraine, nausea",1
i have had migraines for years usually just one or two a month but they were terrible my doctor prescribed me imitrex and it wipes out the migraine if i take it soon enough always carry these with you when imitrex went to generic form i was so relieved but with the generic i have noticed i get dizzy sensations after taking it for about the next 12 hours not too bad and its much better than the migraine so i still think its a miracle,migraine,1
i have had excruciating headaches since i was a teenager but they were not diagnosed as migraines until i was in my 40s once i was prescribed the imitrex i feel like a totally different person if the pain is caught at the onset the headache will usually go away before it gets severe it is very rare that i will need to take more than one tablet to get rid of the pain this has been a true lifesaver for me before i had sumatriptan imitrex i was down for 23 days and could not function at all i missed work and a lot of life due to the pain as i get older the headaches are less frequent and so i do believe that my headaches are triggered by my hormones i keep hoping that before too long i wont have the headaches at all for those who suffer from the dreaded migraine i honestly believe that there is hope,"headache, migraine, pain",1
best cure for my migraines makes me drowsy and sleep for about 2 hours and when i wake up the migraine has vanished it is a life saver,migraine,1
i did not touch my migrain at all or help my nausea about an hour later my head felt much less painful but then it just exploded back,nausea,1
for me this medicine is a miracle it takes about an hour for it to set in but after that its as if i had never had a migraine in my life the only side effects are a slight tingling sensation which causes me to sneeze though id take that side effect over a migraine any day,"migraine, tingling sensation",1
have been dealing with migraines for about 10 years 50 mgs works every time the only downside is that it makes me tired and i need to sleep for about one and a half hours when i wake up im totally pain free,pain,1
i just took my first pill ever about 4 hours fell asleep and just woke up headache is about half gone but i can feel it coming back so i just took another one when i woke up from the nap my legs felt really tired and my hands where clenched into fists and it was kinda painful to get them to unlock we will see what happens after this second dose,headache,1
i have been suffering for over 41 years with migraines and this is the only thing that works for me i do have several side effects tightness in throat tingling in face muscle soreness which occurs when the drug is kicking in and it only lasts no longer than 5 minutes then the headache is gone,headache,1
i began taking this medication to treat migraines and bad headaches no over the counter medication has ever worked for me so it has been amazing to find something that can give me relief after years of suffering if i take 100mg at onset i have a 90 success rate i often feel tired and get a bit of a sore throat but it beats the agnony of a migraine i love relpax and find that it works even better for me but this is much more affordable although still quite expensive,migraine,1
the only side effect i have had has been strong leg and arm fatigue the next day after taking sumatriptan the headache has been wiped out within 1 hour after taking medication,"fatigue, headache",1
this works for me but when i take it i have a problem with the effects i dont get the migraine but my vision is still darkened and i feel like a weight is being placed on top of me and i get tired but no headache,"headache, migraine",1
this works well at taking the migraine away for me but my tongue was swollen and my neck hurt pretty bad for about five hours if you have migraines you know anything is worth a shot but i wont take it again it was just to scary for me,migraine,1
i have been on several medications for my migraines and so far this one does help best to take it at the onset just takes longer if you wait i have figured out that i have virtually no side effects if i take it on a full stomach,,0
it was my first time using the medication ive been using it for a month now it was the only thing that work for me have tried other ones with no results finally found the right one that works for me,,0
i take a 100mg tablet along with one aleve works for me every time also it has to be dr reddys brand anything else doesnt work too bad my insurance hardly covers it,,0
it takes too long to work and it makes my throat sore but at least it takes the edge off the pain,"pain, throat sore",1
i have used this medicine for a long time and it is the only thing that i have found that if taken at the onset of a migraine it will relieve it within 2030 minutes 95 of the time i originally was using the self injected method and i am very happy with the oral med prior to using this med i could be down and out sometimes for several days vomiting and seeking a dark quiet spot in the back of our clothes closet this med is a miracle for me i only wish it also helped everyone with migraines,"migraine, vomiting",1
nauseahot flasheyes dialted not really taking the head away,,0
take 50 mg and works great makes me a little achy but its worth it have to watch for rebound though if you have frequent headaches,frequent headaches,1
it hardly works and has an instant nasty after taste that stays for too long,,0
,,0

i still have massive migraines that start on the right side of my head and stays with me for now 4 days although the migraine isnt constant ive taken this medication and it hasnt worked for me,migraine,1
i have suffered sever pressure headaches for several years advil and tylenol worked to relive pain but after 6 years it quit working i turned to the doctors that gave me this drug it would instantly take the migraine away but would come back twice as worse within a few hours i would have to take up to 5 a day to make it through each day,"migraine, pain",1
it helps alot with the migraine headaches but i think i have the worsed side effect from it it makes my whole body so sore about 2030 mins after and it feels like my throat is closing on me its hard to swallow and my chest is sore but they just tried me on that maxalt and it did the same thing but it start till like 6 months ago and it just seems to get worse i have just been trying to ignore it but i think it is at the worsed now,migraine,1
dr prescribed this med for abdominal pain after surgery underlying cause still unknown i have tried many different things and this really takes the edge off helps me function,"abdominal pain, pain, surgery",1
suffered with migraine headaches for years often times they would last for days and i would vomit numerous times this drug is wonderful ive used it now for about 5 years and i wouldnt be caught without having it on handin my purse as i age the headaches are becoming fewer the only advantage ive found so far about growing older,migraine,1
,,0
so far so good i was just diagnosed with cluster headaches i took one tab 20 minutes ago and the headache is gone we will see if it does the trick these headaches have made it impossible for me to work,headache,1
i have used this drug for about one year now it almost always help sometimes i may need two must wait two hours between tablets but one if taken early on will stop the migraine with no side effects sometimes two may cause mild side effects for me this this medication is a great help untill i used it a migraine would knock me out for hours,migraine,1
this medicine is backup when my maxalt doesnt work fr a migraine when i took it it helped ease the pain very quickly i would recommend it,"migraine, pain",1
sumatriptan is magic take it at the onset and 20 minutes later youre goodtogo have used imitrexsumatpriptan for 2 years,,0
the tablet disolved as soon as i put it in my mouth and gave off a terrible after taste which made me vomit even more it made me extremely tired and dizzy for days after the migraine had subsided i wouldnt recommend it,migraine,1

i am 75 started using keppra in 2012 after a major seizure followed by several minor incidences of lost time i was unaware of my activities for over an hour accomplished regular tasks and awakened later unaware of what i had been doing these occurred many times but short duration doctors did all kinds of studies and threw the pill book at me gabapentin took away the creepy crawly stuff ropinirole helped with night time problems cpap helped but didnt improve keppra clearly helped it took a year to get the dose right but at 1250 mg two times per day leviteracetam i do quite well the doctor started me on 500 mg of keppra but the pharmacist apparently missed the dont substitute order since the lev worked so well in treating the symptoms i talked the doctor into leaving me on multiple pills of lower dosage rather than one higher dosage one argument was that lev is not as well formulated so not regular for consistency i do not experience any side affects that i can show are due to levetiracetam i am suffering still from some kind of lost time for a second or two every year or so but enough that i am not comfortable to drive 1 to 2 seconds at 50 mph caused a pretty severe accident i know of 4 or 5 times when these lost time incidents occurred and i did not fall asleep i was gone for about two seconds to discover bad things happening and decided plus the doctor ordered no more driving i also have a sleep deprivation problem and the two might be related the doctors have not been helpful attentive and order all kinds of tests but they have no idea what it is or they wont tell me,"accident, fall",1
i was having very strange episodes 1month of waking up to phantom odors becoming very nauseous and not remembering that i went to the bathroom thinking i was going to be sick also i would ask many questions about what was going on and since it was dark when this occurred i couldnt remember what my surroundings looked like this would all take place in just a few minutes my husband would talk me back to reality after tests it was classified as some nocturnal seizure this medication has worked with no side effects i started out with only onceday then increased to 2x since i had one small seizure with the smaller dose since increasing the dose i havent had any problems,,0
prescribed following subdural hematoma after 10 months the side effects are horrible for me and my spouse my new neurologist calls keppra the most common cause of divorce he is aware of we are working hard to wean me off this drug,,0
i have taken levetiractetam for 12 years i was one of the very first people to start it when it was released back in the early 2000s in the uk before i started taking this medication i used to have regular petite mal seizures every 3 weeks periods of one day where i would have 10 fits in the same day then nothing for 34 weeks this all started back in 1992 when i had an operation to remove a abbess from my brain since i started this medication i have had 1 seizure so with regards to my actual epilepsy it has been a huge success however over the past 12 years i have noticed side effects that have come and go over the years such as bad mood swings i havnt been able to keep a steady relationship because of them they where very bad in the first 5 years of taking the medication but as time went on my attitude towards life changed and my mood swings vanished this could have something to do with me getting older and wiser rather than the medication itself also fatigue is a bad side effect especially now i have reached my late 30s and it seems to be getting worse i plan to go on an exercise plan this year to try and combat this also i get regular pains in my lower back which i believe are related to my kidneys and liver but my doctor says everything is fine in that department i am happy that this medication has kept me seizure free for so long but now that i am older i am worried about what long term implications it might have on me as i reach middle age,"epilepsy, fatigue, mood swings",1
no seizures for many years of course maybe i would have been seizure free anyway but who wants to experiment,,0
this medication has made my spouse aggressive and hostile and very short tempered i hate it it keeps the seizures away but the moody ness is too much we are working on getting off of it,,0
ive been taking this for about a month now and this has really messed me up it does what its supposed to do but it makes me very irritable i have been showing signs of depression and it has significantly reduced my appetite to the point where i eat maybe 12 a week ive told my neurologist and hopefully i can get the dosage reduced because i refuse to take antidepressants,depression,1
this drug has turned my husband into a moody aggressive person always on edge it does prevent seizures but the behavior it causes is totally crazy,,0
depression mody sense of smell is affected difficultuly sleeping more than 5 hours lack of energy,depression,1
i have been taking this medication for the past 6 months to treat my epileptic episodes this medication does not help with my episodes they have worsened in the recent months and its not only put a strain on me but my work performance as well i dont know what to do i take 2000 mg of this medication daily and still to this day i am still having seizures this medication makes me drowsy on a regular basis tired and weak to the point i cant even work the simplest tasks wear me out and i can barely function at the dosage i am at right now i dont know what to do,,0
started taking 2x 750 mg after trying out lamictal and pretty much every other anticonvulsant and havent had any episodes since side effects hasnt been a problem either havent noticed a major change in anything,,0
it works fine for me im taking other drugs for seizures and it is doing the job no allergic reactions lamictal was a nightmare gave me a rash,"nightmare, rash",1
i still get seizures and have even been in the er for a overdose caused by my doctor he had me taking too much of leveitracetam i changed doctors and my new one lowered me down on the dose but the seizures came back and he raised the dose back up so i am scared i will be back in the hospital from too many seizure again ive read where others are saying to stay away from the generic and stay with keppra i dont know if my insurance will pay for it i will talk to my doctor for help,overdose,1
this drug in combination with phenytoin and 2 other meds has completely stopped my partial seizures has not had a mood change although i notice some loss of memory,partial seizures,1
i had a tbi during may 2012 and during a resultant cranioplasty surgery i had two seizures i was put on keppra for 6 months before the surgery i was relatively aware ie using an ipad etc but after the surgery i was pretty much comatose for several weeks in retrospect we think this was due to the keppra i had another seizure may 2015 and i was put back on the keppra it has made me extremely fatigued despite the extreme fatigue side effect i have not had a seizure while on the keppra my neurologist thinks that my most recent seizure started as a partial in my frontal lobe and then generalized to a full tonicclonic seizure,"fatigue, surgery",1
this medicine was actually a nightmare for me i was on it for a few days and reacted badly and my doctor insisted i try it for at least a month it actually made my myoclonus much worse made me physically ill and i didnt sleep for days at at ime,"myoclonus, nightmare",1
,,0
the medication is effective in preventing temporal seizures silent seizures side effects are the problem 1loss of short term memory i dont remember movie i saw a month ago and dont remember many events that happened over the past 2 years 2loss of sense of smell cant smell food gas or bbq smoke or anything 3loss my sense of touch reduced medication level helped didnt feel cuts or scratches previously 4experience occasional minor depression i started with lamictal after a few days i had an allergic reaction full body rash horrible musclejoint pain drs immediately changed me to keppra timed release 1000mgs at night it took about 2 months to be able to sleep at night prior to that i would get up every 2 to 3 hours because my mind was too active i started keppra 750mgs ampm due to my side effects they changed my dosage as mentioned above has anyone else experienced these side effects have you changed to another medication with fewer side effects,"depression, gas, pain, rash",1
im moody and agitated since i started taking this again it worked great the first time i was on it plus both times ive been on klonopin and never had a problem with it,,0
due to a frontal lobe injury i started having seizures many years later i could have 20 seizures in a day and that made me so tired and i could have these local petite seizures at any time including driving ive be on the generic levetiracetam for a few years now at 375 mg a day and have zero seizures ill admit once in awhile i get very tired and if i just can sleep for even a minute or tow i feel totally refreshed i dont like one of the other side effects and that is this drug may cause hair loss also at times i can become very agitated but id rather have these then seizures,injury,1
took keppra for about 4 months i suffered horrible depression as a side effect and had to be hopitalized my md immediately switched to lamictal i have had no problems since,depression,1
i have used levetiracetam for 11 yrs and have had two brain scans to check on seizures since my aneurism surgery my problem is sexual disfunction since starting this drug is there an alternative that would alleviate this side affect,surgery,1
i found it convenient use no drowsiness it is working without side effects,drowsiness,1
my little one started having tonic clinic seizures a few months ago this is the first and only medication hes been on were still playing with correct dowager but he is having fewer seizures the only side effect hes experienced so far is sleepiness that has only lasted about 2 weeks once the dowager has changed,,0
just change to stop absences re epilepsy,epilepsy,1
i was having absence seizures which i called spells for about 910 years i had one when driving and failed to stop at a lite and ran into the back of the auto in front of me neurologist decided it wasnt migraines and tias and put me on the meds once in the am and once in the pm it has been 6 moths and no more spellsive had no problems with the drug other than some dizziness when i first started the regimen of pillsi am on 500 mg generic and am a male 75 years old,dizziness,1
i have a few dizzy andor weak spells using this medicine but its a lot better than having a seizure i was also told by my neurologist to take vitamin b12 with it once a day and another dose at night without the b12 taking 500 mg twice a day i was having a seizure once or twice a week and have no more since being on this generic for keppra,,0
ive had a lifetime of nighttime seizures only recently have they changed form to where i had a couple absence seizures in the first couple hours of my day ive only been on this medication for a week and a half so this review may be a bit premature here it is though i feel extra tired at times our main concern is this were not totally sure yet if this is related to the medication it seems there has been a decrease in my sex drive since starting the pill im not able to totally perform other than that everything seems okay,,0

very stiff and sore congested anxious fearfulloss of memory,,0
age 75 had spells for the past 11 years and no one could diagnose them spells were brief but the last one was while i was driving coming to a stop light and i didnt stop no one hurt but went to neurologist and he prescribed generic keppra about one month ago a little dizzy and lethargic but no spells yet on 500 mg twice a day,,0

the seizure control has been impeccable since starting it no seizures not even with lack of sleep flashing lights or caffeine however the side effects extreme anxietypanic irritability and depression have been so severe that after eight months i had to begin taking an antidepressant anti anxiety med to offset this i also have ongoing nasal issues which began after starting the levetiracetam since i want a safe medicine for my pregnancy i will stay on it after having babies though i will try to find something that does not alter my personality or outlook on life,"anxiety, depression, irritability, pregnancy",1
have had this mild seizure disorder for years liked this drug the best since beginning the treatment i have experienced a gradualbut noticeable decline in seizure episodes to where they are now almost nonexistant however for me there has been a noticeable increase in needed periods of sleep no other side effects noted,,0
i have tried two other perscriptions before being on this onethe others i didnt even want to take they were so horriblehowever after 6 years of being on this drug i have no issues with sideaffects,,0

my first seizure was in january 2000 i had broken blood vessel in my left temporal lobe which caused a seizure was highly allergic to the old medications i went to my dr and told him that the risks out weighed the benefits i went off my medication for about nine years i then had a grand mal seizure which they could not determined what cause it i was given very high doses of keppra but the cost was astronomical and had rashes itching of anal area and extremely dry skin i switched to levetiracetam and i am still having the above but not as severe but i have noticed that when i have a chin hair on my face or a pimple the skin becomes encrusted with dry skin and any previously oily areas on my face t zone there is dead dry patches every day nothing is getting rid of the dry dead skin on my face,dry skin,1
the price was so high i quit taking them 500 per month,,0
levetiracetam has been really good to me at first i was only taking half a pill twice a day but now i take 1 whole pill twice a day it has really stopped my seizures i have only had two i had two in one day it was the 1st time it ever happened to me i was at school and the second time was once i got discharged from the hospital the same day keppra still does sometimes make me a little dizzy sleeping and i dont know if this is a side effect but sometimes moody but overall it helps a lot,,0
i have just started taking this med for light seizures caused from having a brain tumor removed in 2004 it is my third med and so im being very careful to watch for side effects the first med caused me to be up all night contemplating suicide ive only began this med so cant say much about it right now i have been feeling very down and not sure if it is the med or some other reason the waves in my head have stopped but i am concerned that being on seizure meds could cause full blown seizures for me i also worry about taking it with my bp meds no one wants to say it is okay to take 6 different meds during a day i feel very tired all the time,"suicide, worry",1
i have been on this medication for 1 12 years i feel great my mind is much clearer no seizures on this medication,,0

the first time that i used this medication my previous doctor prescribe me 1000 mg per day and it was not generic after that the dosage was increased to 1500 mg and i was filling ok almost seizures free i was using it combined with depakote and valium my doctor decided to take away valium and increase depakote and i continued filling ok moving to another state i was forced to change doctor and the new one change regular depakote to depakote er and also increased keppra to 6000 mg a day because he said that the dosage was too low this was after a blood work he asked me if the price between brand name and generic was significant and i said yes he then prescribed generic and himself ordered it from my supplier today i have more seizures than never and the control over it is almost nothing i dont know if this is because of generic or if the condition is going worst for some other reason i visited another neurologist to get a second opinion and he said we should continue as you was before if that was working better to you we dont fix what is not broken he continued i am going tomorrow to a new visit to my actual doctor and i will bring comments from this page to him because it was helpful,,0

my 6 year old daughter have been taking keppra for over 5 years and was seizing once a year at the most when she is sick because her immune system is so weak in february of 2009 she was switched to the generic keppra levetiracetam giant pharmacist had switch without asking us first we didnt realize this until july 3 2009 within february and july she seizes three times the first two we were able to control it with ativan but the last one we couldnt we gave extra doses of levetiracetam and ativan and still couldnt controlled her seizures within three days she seizes 50 times this happened while we were on vacation we took her the to the emergency room and the doctor took blood sample and found out that her platelet counts was 12000 normal is 150000 she was airlifted to children hospital they check for the levetiracetam level in her blood and there are none there was discussions that levetiracetam was the culprit of the low platelet counts but can not confirmed so the doctors slowly takes her off the levetiracetam but she was still seizing in the mean time another neurologist decided to put her back on keppra and gave her an extra dose of keppra and within hours she stop seizing we realized at that time that the generic have no effects on controlling my daughters seizures please do not substitute name brand keppra for generic the neurologist that we spoke to said that for anti convulsion drugs best to stay with name brand,convulsion,1

ive been on keppra for 3 years straight for partial onset seizues and never experienced a seizure nor side effect 500mg perday like others on my last refill cvs was pleased to tell me that i can save 50 per refill by trying this new generic i was ecstatic two months later i am still seizurefree however my personality has changed from cheerful and positive to completely depressed and zombielike i am lethargic and have no desire to participate in any daily activites i am practically causing a divorce in my marriage 10 minutes ago i called my pharmacy and asked that they never give me this generic again i am back to keppra and will be happy to pay the extra dollars to get my personality back well not happy to pay but i will pay,,0
i have been taking tegratol and carbatrol for years since i was 11 and my new doctor put me on this new medication she put me on keppra but cvs gave me the generic levetiracetam its been a couple of months and i gradually came of carbatrol and increased levetiracetam i am on 1000 mg twice a day and the doctor asked me to increase it to 1500 mg twice a day last night i had my first siezure in over 24 years i am not sure if it is because of the new medication or because cvs gave me the levetiracetam and not keppra i will call the doctor on monday,,0

my daughter has had what we call grand mall seizures since she was 12 she has been on carbatrol most of those years but always had break through seizures 18 months ago her nuerologist put her on keppra it has been a godsend to us she has not had any seizures on it and is finally taking drivers ed at the age of 21 we are so scared her insurance company just made us change to the generic this week we have to change we cant pay out of pocket for keppra does anyone have experience with this condition and this drug does it work the same she just got her life back how can insurance companies control our lives like this,,0

i had a distal gastric bypass in 1998 and now have bad joints and major back problems being such a specialized surgery my family doctor does not understand the major malabsorption of opioid medications hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination which in my case i had 63 of my small intestine bypassed which from what i get on the internet should make my pain med dose nearly twice what it is for a normal person because this is a controlled substance my hometown family doctor tells me she cannot give me any more than the standard maximum dose however now that i am much older i need a higher dose she also told me that if i go to oxycodone she could not match the dose of hydrocodone i have tried to get my situation heard and understood only to find out other doctors will not even see me because i have a pain contract with my family doctor and when i went to the dea to voice my problems all they did was flag my file as being a possible drug addict or dealer which its very hard to get them to remove from your file it took me three years i have tried the fda and they move slower than the us mail when i first went on hydrocodone it worked and kept me at about a 3 on the pain scale however now that i am older and the reason i am on pain medication is getting worse i cannot get a higher dose and my doctor simply does not understand anything about my malabsorption problem with my distal gastric bypass surgery that requires me to have higher doses of nearly all oral drugs but most importantly i am having the following problems vomiting nausea stomach pain dark urine a strange light clay look to my stool skin rash nearly everywhere that seems not to ever heal cannot seem to sleep enough dry mouth developed asthma itch all over dark spots bumps that seem to move from place to place puss filled eruptions on skin what can i do dark urine stomachabdominal pain extreme tiredness or yellowing eyesskin,"asthma, dry mouth, malabsorption, nausea, pain, rash, surgery, vomiting",1

i was taking tylenol for knee pain especially at bedtime for a few years sometimes i would have to take it upon awakening or even during the day but i really needed it at night i was disappointed that its action didnt last longer but i continued to use tylenol because i thought it was probably the safest thing to do to treat the pain even though i sometimes had to take it several times throughout the day i never went over the recommended daily dosage now however my doctor wont let me use it at all she was concerned about its affect on my liver function and had me stop it completely my liver function tests have stabilized since i stopped taking the tylenol i now take aleve it takes fewer doses lasts longer and hasnt caused the problems with my liver,"knee pain, pain",1

my only problem with tylenol is due to its ease of use and no immediate apparent side effects and due to the continuing pain from fibromyalgia it became easy to take far too much on a regular basis plus i believe there is a rebound effect to consider the more you take the more the need for it builds thereby losing its effectiveness so after taking more than the label advised for many years to combat the pain i slowly weaned myself off of it now i use relatively little 23 extra strength tylenol per night to take just the edge off the pain and because i no longer overuse it what little i take is more helpful i have chosen to not otherwise use medication to treat my fibromyalgia pain instead relying on exercise and other lifestyle choices im also aware that tylenol is processed through the liver so i avoid drinking alcohol when using it which means most of the time,"fibromyalgia, pain, rebound effect",1
