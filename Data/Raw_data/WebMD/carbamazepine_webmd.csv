354617,65-74,Facial Nerve Pain,5/15/2019,carbamazepine,1493,4,4,"My Trigeminal Neuralgia started in 1996 as the result of a severe undiscovered infection caused by a corroded silver pin used during a root canal when I was 11 years old.(I am a language teacher and singer, and went through some excruciating days, using ice packs, heat, etc.)  Doctors just kept wanting to give me pain killers and all the dentists I went to, kept telling me they could see nothing wrong.  Meanwhile, the abscess was eating through my jaw bone.  After it was finally big enough to be discovered, about 10 - 12 months,(and x-rays got more precise) and the abscess was taken care of,  it went away for 20 years. I then moved and found a new dentist who did NOT LISTEN to me!  He made a night guard for the wrong area of my mouth and the TGN started again. Had two very severe attacks in 2017 and I have been using  Carbamazepine as needed when I feel twinges.  I have been very lucky.  I want to let you know about an organic essential that was introduced to me in a health/natural store. You roll it on the outside of the area causing the pain and I have found it to be extremely helpful.  It is VERIDITAS by Pranarom and is called: Just Plain Relief.  Yes,  that's  Plain (with an ""l"").  I take two 200 mg grams of Carba... twice a day and if I do get a spasm, I roll this on.  I find it very soothing and considerably helpful.  I certainly hope you find the right combination that will work for you.   ",4, ,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  dizziness , drowsiness,  constipation ,  dry mouth , or unsteadiness may occur.",6

354632,55-64,Epileptic Seizure,3/18/2019,carbamazepine,1493,5,5,"I have used carbamazepine ER for 30 years and it has worked well except for 2 seizures 14 years ago which I attribute to 'the change.'  I had to increase my doseage to a total of 1100mg/day, split between morning and evening.  I have had some memory loss, but that started just after my first seizure when I was 35 and was told it was brain disintegration (can't think of the right word).  Finding words is sometimes difficult but can't know if it is the medication or the state of my brain after the seizure.  Every 3 weeks or so I have an aura where I can't follow conversation or process information well.  It ends with a headache so I know it is going away.  If often lasts all day and I may wake up with it.  I don't know if that means less control by the medicine or not.  At least I have not had any seizures for 14 years.  The only really BAD thing is that this drug is part of a class of AEDs that cause bone loss.  After all of these years, I have severe osteoporosis and broke my arm after a bad fall.  The surgeon had to pin everything together and said my bones were weaker than he had anticipated.  Considering I may have at least another 20 years to go, I am considering changing to another drug that does not affect bones.  However, all of the reviews I have read on those (lamotrigine, vimpat, topirimate and leviracetam) are very scary.  Taking Fosamax for my bones is not the answer, apparently, since I had been doing that for a number of years.  Anyone with any info on this is very appreciated.  I suggest all long term users to have bone density tests every 2 years - even the men.

Now on Carbamazepine, which seems to help but only been on it for 3 weeks. Neuro wants to change that to gabapentin, but side effect reviews for that scare me. I haven't had any pain since 1-2-19, so hoping its working. My pain comes whenever, night or day and lasts anywhere from 1/2 hr to 2 hrs. Would rather go thru childbirth with no assistance than this pain. I'm hoping someone finds an effective cure for this because it's ruining my life-afraid to do anything or go anywhere because it starts out of nowhere. Don't want to embarass myself or my husband.

The medicine did work gor me. And the highest dosage I took was 1000 msg per day. But like all medicines there are side affects. I was feeling depression and at times suicidial but I never attempted to do anything so drastic. Because the pain of TN has been know to cause that. I never gave up and I hope this helps someone and gives them hope. I will try gamma knife again if the pain comes back.

The pain gets dulled away, but some days I can feel it leak through the medication and ruin my life. My wife hates those days. I went to an ENT and he says get your septum fixed and it'll help. I get the surgery. The pain is still there. Can anyone out there with trigeminal neuralgia tell me if they have a constant pain all the time like I do? I've had an MRI and a CT scan and they say nothing is wrong, so it must be that nerve. But everyone else seems like their pain comes and goes. Mine is always there.

Ironically, I had just had a dental procedure done to the lower molar on that side of my mouth.
I repeatedly went to my dentist to have the severe pain corrected.
He could find nothing wrong, but gave me Vicodan to relieve the pain.
At first, the Vicodan worked. After 10 to 20 minutes the pain disappeared like the snap of my fingers. I can descibe it no other way.
It worked for a for about 3 hours before the pain returned.
It was not very long, maybe 4 days or so before it stopped working and I had that intense pain again.
I kept adding pain relievers to the vicidan...tylenol, asperin, alieve etc.
Nothing worked.
At one point I took the Vicidan, 3 tablets, 3 asperin, alieve and some percoset given to me by a co-worker all within an hour.
I know that this was dangerous and very very stupid.
However, even this excessive dose did NOTHING for the pain.
I finally went to my doctor and within seconds of explaining the pain and location he prescribed this medicine.
I only had to take 200 mg, for one or two days and my condition ended.

To me this is a miracle drug and thank the Lord for a miracle doctor.
I realize that this medicine is proscribed for many conditions and may not work for all of them, but for my particular condition, it was a Godsend.",5,Male,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  dizziness , drowsiness,  constipation ,  dry mouth , or unsteadiness may occur.",16

I couldn't take any higher dose so switched to neurontin for 6 months.  Not as effective.  Tried accupuncture, seemed to help for quite a while, a year or more I'd say.  Then almost like magic symptoms went away.  I would catch a pain on occasion but nothing but a reminder of what it was.

""Onsets"" were non-existant. The medication seemed to be elevating and perpetuating existing symptoms. The medication was easy to ingest and Very Hard to tolerate. Hot Water Bottle or Ice Pack in hand, vertually all possible negative side affects were a part of these sessions. Trigeminal Neuralgia has been coined the ""Suicude Disease.""

Quite often it has already been X days or weeks that things have been progressing; On the floor, in tears, and absolutely helpless!
