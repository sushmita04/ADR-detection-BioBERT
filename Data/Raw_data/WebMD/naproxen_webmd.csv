This was on 1250MG. ![The 150 minutes became less over time, as bad as 65 minutes]!

ease of use, well, obviously. Clench it between your teeth, drown it with water. Very easy to use and swallow due to it's shape.

Now you see 4 stars for effectiveness and 5 stars for Ease of Use so you may wonder why my overall satisfaction is 1 star. In my case, beastly side effects.

- The effectiveness went down as time went on, the toll it took on my digestive system and stomach lining didn't. Perhaps even mild compounding effect.

- My Stomach was not happy with it and signaling is still bad (I no longer know when/if I'm hungry)

- Caused a lot of stomach bleeds, combined with the side-effect of being somewhat slow, I've gotten to experience a few near death experiences in the morning by almost choking on my [regurgitated] blood. Now it's a rare side-effect so it took a few close calls for it to be found.

- It numbed far more than just the pain. Can't finish the memory, lose track in the middle of a sentence, sudden onset of sleepiness. I had to choose health or work because this medication didn't allow me both. It went quiet in my head and gave me loopy dreams.

- I have stopped taking it and the effects on my sleeping rhytm, stomach function and brain communication can still be noticed months after.

BOTTOM LINE:

Use no more than needed, hide it away (so you don't go take more with a cloudy head) And I would seriously advice against prolonged use if you have ANY alternative.

But it was a one time thing, I now take half of the dose (I break 500mg in 1/2)but I dont know if it will be enough as I am still in pain (severe back pain). I have pain killers but my doctor wants me to not take them so I don't unless the pain is so unbearable for me. Im now in PTherepy and it's hard! About 40 hours after my therepy my pain level is at least an 8/10 I am just thinking, this is how it is suppose to be. I feel safer and better taking a pain killer 1 to 2 times a day, I dont feel as I have the personality to become addicted to pain medications which...I guess...many people do. I was once on 3 oxycotin in conjunction with 3 percocet daily and one day (from switching doctors) went off of them cold turkey and the only side effect I had was...unbearable, excruciating,unimaginable pain!

I have discovered, for me, that I cannot take any kind of anti-inflammatory drug, even over the counter ibiproferin (?) will start my stomach pain again.   So maybe that could be part of the stomach problems that have been mentioned here.

When the ulcer first started with the Vioxx, my Dr. had me take all the drugs for GERD, heartburn, anything related to the stomach.  Nothing worked, after multiple tests, I finally insisted on the test where they use a camera in your stomach...sure enough, there was the ulcer!!  Stated taking ACIPHEX and it was almost instant relief!  Sometimes you have to listen to your own body.  The ins. companys would rather go with trial and error than try the best (?), more expensive drugs/ treatment and the Drs.usually go along with them.
