For as long as I can remember I have suffered with migraine headaches sometimes three to four times per month and each occurence could last up to three days. I would be hypersensitive to light and noise. My head would ache severely on my left side.   I would be nauseous and sometimes dizzy and miserable from the feelings of helplessness. I struggled through elementary and high school and persevered through the agony.  Tylenol, aspirin, ibuprofen did nothing to lessen the pain. It was after my family doctor tried me on many other alternatives that he suggested Sumatriptan.   I was in my late 20s. It was a lifesaver!! It is the ONLY medication that has taken away my migraines. I just turned 60 and although the frequency of my migraine attacks has reduced, the intensity remains the same. Sumatriptan works EVERY time to take the pain and symptoms away. I honestly do not know how I could live on today if it were not for Sumatriptan.   The negligible side effects are transient and insignificant compared to the migraine pain. From what I understand it does not work on some people who claim to have headaches. All I can suggest is that their headaches may not be actual migraines but possibly some other headache that Sumatriptan is not designed to treat.  If it doesn't work for you that doesn't mean that it doesn't work for others. It saved my life and my sanity.

The problem is that the pharmacy insurance (CareMark/CVS) would not refill my prescription as 9 tablets were supposed to last for 30 days. (? not)  I spent the morning on the telephone to CareMark customer service and the very nice yet uninformed lady agreed to a refill without paying $154 for 9 tablets.  In future, she said that any refills must have prior authorization.  My doctor's office was very agreeable to that and said that when I get down to 6 tablets to give them a call and they would take care of it…..time will tell on that part.  I will make quite sure to call on a Monday so that everyone has the allotted 24-72 hours to  manifest the operation!  Quelle merde.
