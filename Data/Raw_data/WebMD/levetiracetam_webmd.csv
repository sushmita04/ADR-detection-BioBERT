36591,75 or over,Simple Partial Seizures,6/18/2018,levetiracetam,17855,5,5,"I am 75, started using Keppra in 2012 after a major seizure followed by several minor incidences of 'lost time' - I was unaware of my activities for over an hour, accomplished regular tasks and awakened later unaware of what I had been doing. These occurred many times but short duration. Doctors did all kinds of studies and threw the pill book at me - gabapentin took away the creepy crawly stuff, ropinirole helped with night time problems, CPAP helped but didn't improve, Keppra clearly helped, it took a year to get the dose right, but at 1250 mg two times per day (Leviteracetam) I do quite well. The doctor started me on 500 mg of Keppra, but the pharmacist apparently missed the 'don't substitute' order. Since the Lev worked so well in treating the symptoms, I talked the doctor into leaving me on multiple pills of lower dosage rather than one higher dosage one. Argument was that Lev is not as well formulated so not regular for consistency.
I do not experience any side affects that I can show are due to Levetiracetam. I am suffering still from some kind of 'lost time' for a second or two every year or so, but enough that I am not comfortable to drive - 1 to 2 seconds at 50 mph caused a pretty severe accident.  I know of 4 or 5 times when these 'lost time' incidents occurred and I did not fall asleep - I was gone for about two seconds to discover bad things happening and decided (plus the doctor ordered) no more driving.
I also have a sleep deprivation problem and the two might be related. The doctors have not been helpful. Attentive and order all kinds of tests, but they have no idea what it is or they won't tell me.",5,Male,"Drowsiness,  dizziness , unusual tiredness, or  weakness  may occur.",6

Also, I would ask many questions about what was going on and since it was dark when this occurred, I couldn't remember what my surroundings looked like.  This would all take place in just a few minutes. My husband would talk me back to reality. After tests, it was classified as some nocturnal seizure.  This medication has worked with no side effects.

I was one of the very first people to start it when it was released back in the early 2000's in the UK. Before i started taking this medication i used to have regular petite mal seizures every 3 weeks (periods of one day where i would have 10 fits in the same day, then nothing for 3-4 weeks). This all started back in 1992 when i had an operation to remove a abbess from my brain. Since i started this medication, i have had 1 seizure, so with regards to my actual epilepsy, it has been a huge success. However, over the past 12 years I have noticed side effects that have come and go over the years, such as bad mood swings (I havnt been able to keep a steady relationship because of them). They where very bad in the first 5 years of taking the medication, but as time went on my attitude towards life changed and my mood swings vanished, this could have something to do with me getting older and wiser rather than the medication itself. Also fatigue is a bad side effect, especially now i have reached my late 30's and it seems to be getting worse. I plan to go on an exercise plan this year to try and combat this. Also i get regular pains in my lower back, which i believe are related to my kidneys and liver, but my doctor says everything is fine in that department. I am happy that this medication has kept me seizure free for so long, but now that I am older, i am worried about what long term implications it might have on me as I reach middle age.",4, ,"Drowsiness,  dizziness , unusual tiredness, or  weakness  may occur.",18
