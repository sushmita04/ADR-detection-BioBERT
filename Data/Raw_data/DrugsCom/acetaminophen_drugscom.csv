"November 28, 2019",,Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Fever:,"I rate it 5, I've had a very high fever and after taking paracetamol it only made it worse. That is why, they suggested me to take paracetamol every 4 hours, as a result, my fever is now gone but my stomach is suffering. I currently have stomach/intestinal disturbances due to paracetamol. This medicine is 50:50",5
"October 16, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"In the early nineties I was taking Tylenol for severe headaches. We had first responders in our workplace that pushed me to larger strengths and doses. ""You're a big guy, you need it, you can take it.""
Don't listen.  Never go over the recommended dose for your weight,  It will permanently damage your liver.  
My liver transplant was Dec. 19, 1996.",
"September 12, 2020",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Muscle Pain:,"Paracetamol The only thing that works for me without any side effects, takes about 20 minutes to kick in, fantastic for muscle pain and anxiety attacks and insomnia, I take two 500mg tablets every 4 hours (four times a day), for two days then I'm okay.",10
"July 8, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"It’s one of the most worthless medicines I know of. I have tried Tylenol on numerous occasions throughout my life for migraines, back pain, menstrual cramps, post surgical pain, arthritis pain because some doctor or friend has recommended it. Each time it did absolutely nothing for me. Aspirin is a better pain reliever. Now with severe chronic pain, my Doctor wants me to try it again. No thank you. I give it 1 star because I never suffered any side effects from it.",1
"January 1, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,It is the ABSOLUTE WORST PAINKILLER to take when you have period pain. It does did not ease my period pain at all. I would not recommend it to anyone . DON'T TOUCH IT. I am very lucky now that I do not take Paracetamol anymore.,1
"May 31, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I had a sudden experience of lower back pain, to the point where it hurt to breathe, and I wasn't able to sit because it meant bending my back. I took 2 pills of the extra strength. After about 15-20 minutes I could breathe without crying, it was still extremely painful to sit, but after another 15 minutes or so 90% of the pain was completely gone. So thankful  for Tylenol extra strength!",10
"September 3, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Fever:,"Great if you have a fever. But if you need pain relief, This won't help. I found It does work better if you have a cup of coffee with it, Otherwise see your doctor for real pain relief. Never take more than the recommended dosage. It can destroy your liver.",5
"January 26, 2011",,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,Only over the counter pain med I can take with Crohn's disease.  All other pain killers have some degree of aspirin in them.  For those with stomach diseases acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the only thing we can take.,9
"February 5, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Sciatica:,"My doctor insisted I take acetaminophen in spite of me telling him it has never helped with any pain I have ever had, and surprise! It had no effect on my severe sciatica pain either.  I don't know why doctors keep prescribing it considering there are studies readily available to anyone who can read, that have proven that acetaminophen is no better than placebo when it comes to back pain relief (the Cochrane Reviews), AND  ""Analysis of national databases show that acetaminophen-associated overdoses account for about 50,000 emergency room visits and 25,000 hospitalizations yearly."" (Dr. Aric Hausknecht, a New York neurologist and pain management specialist.) 

My experience is that it doesn't work and I can read so I know it is ineffective period and is dangerous; and I am astonished and offended when a medical professional who should know better tells me to take it for any reason.",1
"April 11, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I have gotten migraines from childhood. I also am very active and sometimes suffer neck and shoulder pain resulting in yet another headache.
I have used tylenol for my entire adult life and I cannot even think of what life would've been without it. I have always gotten high fevers with no other symptoms when others get sick. Tylenol has helped me thru all of it. From migraines, to horrible monthly cramps. Crazy when I think about it...It allowed me to function normally through some of the worst moments of life. I am, thankfully, a perfectly healthy 51 yr old and 2 hrs ago I woke with a sickening headache from 3 days of hard yard work. All gone now. Got to thinking...I should say...""Thank you Tylenol.""",10
"October 13, 2009",,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I was prescribed 1 gram (2 extra strength) by mouth every 4-6 hours for a severe tooth problem, cracked tooth in half, until I see my dentist on Friday. (It's Tuesday.) Does absolutely nothing for the pain. ",1
"September 11, 2010",,Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I have found Tylenol and other equivalents to be relatively ineffective in reducing pain associated with my Degenerative Disk Disease (Neck Pain, Severe Headaches, Lower Back Pain).  I have had some success with tramadol coupled with muscle relaxants, Tylenol with codeine and Vicodin (5 and 7.5 mg).  I also had good results with Aleve, until I started to have stomach problems.",
"April 10, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Tylenol Arthritis Pain (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"My doctor won't prescribe medication for my fibromyalgia and arthritis pain. He told me to take Tylenol Arthritis. Well, it works sometimes, but most of the time it barely touches the pain. If I take aspirin with it, it works better. But I'm still in a lot of pain. I don't like using creams, because I had a cat die from Icy Hot poisoning, so that's not really an option. I need something else.",5
"August 16, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Sciatica:,"Tylenol did zero to help my Sciatic nerve pain, although it's helped in the past with other issues.  -  nothing else prescribed helped either but oddly enough Mocha flavoured monster drink would remove about 80% of the pain for about 5-8 hours. I have no idea why but it's the only relief I get.(except hot showers help too it seems)",5
"February 6, 2019",,Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I had my rotator cuff repaired and I was sent home with a block in my arm that did not even last 24 hours. Also I was sent home with a liquid bulb of pain medicine around my neck with the tubing inserted into my shoulder. In less than 24 hours the tubing leaked twice and finally just fell out. I had one pain medicine prescription. I had to half each one into 4. It was terrible pain and the doctors advised me to take extra strength Tylenol. It does noting for me. I don’t understand why there’s a push to take Tylenol. I’m certain Tylenol would work for me if I exceeded the recommended does. Thus, why so many people have liver damage. Tylenol and extra strength Tylenol is like taking nothing. I even tried going without it and then taking Tylenol. No difference!!!  Nothing!!",
"December 21, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Tylenol 8 Hour (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I use it a few times per week for pain flares with my chronic pain. It seems to work better than extra strength and longer. I don't need to rely on my oxycodone as much now that I take this for some pain flares. That being said, not every pain flare is the same and I end up still using one of my oxycodone. I'm allowed up to 4 per day, but now I take one or two since I started to use Tylenol 8 hour. I use the store brand of it too and it works just as well.",9
"January 1, 2022",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Fever:,"This is great. I've had a small pain in my head when I woke up this morning and decided to ignore it. It started getting worse and I realized I was developing a fever around 5:00PM. Even though I had the help of my younger sister to try and reduce the fever and headache, it just hasn't gone away entirely. I was unable to figure out a way to reduce the pain I was in so I called my mother and told her the pain I was in. Conveniently enough, my mother mentioned that we did have Tylenol at home. I went to the room that she told me I'd find it in. I found the Tylenol and downed a pill with water. In just a minute or two, the pain has basically completely vanished and my fever has been reduced greatly.",9
"February 4, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol Cool Caplet Extra Strength (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"Took one capsule before going to bed for a week to help sleep (arthritis). Had a reaction of hypertension and tachycardia.  Stopped taking anything extra beside regular meds.  Took it again about a month later.  Had the same reaction, only much worse.  Ended up in the OR.  Realized what the cause was.  I have never taken anymore and condition has not returned after three months.  My doctors were not aware of this reaction from Tylenol until I found this site.",4
"October 25, 2020",,For Sciatica:,"acetaminophen works for my Sciatica mine. I get them from a medical professional. I use them until I can get a cortisone shot. showers do help.
Many over doses are caused by people taking the same medicine so you have to make sure you don't go over the prescribed daily dosage.I need to eat to keep from having a upset tummy. Also with any aspirin you are suppose to drink milk not water.",10
"April 8, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Sciatica:,"I have had a major back surgery and after tons of morphine, oxycodone, and OxyContin, the only things that takes my low back pain to zero is Buprenorphine. No type of  injections worked either. However, the only thing, including all the opioids that helps my sciatic pain is Tylenol. I can’t take any NSAIDS due to kidney failure from Metformin and NSAIDS but they never helped my sciatica.",10
"May 5, 2011",,For Pain:,Tylenol PM helps me so much with my pain at night because at night my back pain is the worst and every once in a while I take a Tylenol PM and I feel great and can sleep well and I also feel better the next couple days. ,
"January 9, 2017",,Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,Administered an IV bolus of 600mg of Paracetamol to a patient in severe to moderate pain and patient suddenly started sleeping off but that was not expected so I checked and found the pulse unrecordable and BP not measurable. Quickly gave and IV bolus of saline and restored vitals and subsequently monitored patient for the next six hours. I think the effect of rapid administration IV should be hammered on.,6
"August 31, 2009",,Tylenol 8 Hour (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I used to take regular Tylenol two at a time, when I needed I  got up to taking 3 to 4 times a day. I switched to taking the 8 hour version and it really works fairly well. It is OTC medicine and reasonable price and it works.",8
"August 22, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,For Pain:,"I take acetaminophen for various reasons, mostly headaches though. I was advised to stay away from all NSAID medications due to the risk of GI bleeding when mixed with anti-depressants. Acetaminophen isn't the best pain relieving substance but it works well enough for me.",7
"August 22, 2016",,Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"I started taking Tylenol Extra Strength for pain after a deep puncture wound requiring skin glue. It's powerful stuff, so I never took more than 1,000 milligrams (2 pills) at a time. The max daily dose is 4,000 milligrams, but I never need(ed) that much; about half of that does the trick for me. I haven't had any negative side effects, but I worry I may become dependent on it if I don't taper off soon. I've read what it can do to a person's liver...",10
"November 18, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"This is called ""extra strength"" but it does NOTHING? Every six hours because it's a big, bad painkiller. I can't take anything but Tylenol right now and that's really, really sad. I may as well not take anything and suffer through.",1
"November 3, 2009",,For Fever:,My son has had a lo-grade fever for three days. I've had him on Tylenol every 4 hours but decided to try Motrin instead during his regular dosing schedule. It didn't do a thing. His fever kept rising. Tylenol is the only thing that has worked for him.,9
"November 15, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,For Pain:,"It cannot be overstated how dangerous this medication is.

Over 100 teens DIE yearly in the USA ALONE from an Acetaminophen OD.

I believe personal experience is illustrative & common so I'll share.

The child was not truly trying to harm herself, as with most, they don't think it can harm them, their desire is to regain control.

They may vomit - regardless, they wake the next morning feeling embarrassed but fine, unaware their liver is dying inside them - & by the time they realize they are sick, nothing can be done.

Please EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN ON THE DANGERS of this is liver-killing POISON!

NEVER EXCEED recommended dosage, I never go above 3 doses daily, & NEVER MIX WITH ALCOHOL!

I also avoid APAP meds, 5Mg oxycone, not Percocet, etc",
"May 22, 2021",,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,The 2021 commercial is very sincere and touching.  I use tylenol and it works well for me.  After see the commercial I feel like the company is in business for more reasons than just the revenue.   It has worked well for me through a variety of medical issues and I will continue to use this product.  Thanks,10
"April 2, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Pain:,"Tylenol has never worked even a little for me. It seems to be the go-to pain reliever at hospitals and emergency rooms here in Canada, but really does nothing, even when it's Tylenol-3. It has never even got rid a headache for me, let alone real pain.

I can't count the number of times it's been prescribed for me following surgery for broken bones (for use after I'm off morphine or other opiates). It might as well be a sugar pill. My sister is the same — it just does nothing. I don't know why they still give this to people as a pain reliever. I always end up buying naproxen or ibuprofen instead.",1
"October 22, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Coles Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,Although I have a side effect of dry mouth and mild dizziness it takes away the pain as it should. The dry mouth appears when taking 4 or more in and 12hr period. Whereas the dizziness is more immediate 1hr after indigestion but dissipates an 1 to 2 hrs after ingestion.,7
"May 19, 2020",,For Sciatica:,I really recommend giving actaminophen a shot. for a while it’s the only thing that would get my through the night because of my lower back and hip pain. Nothing else worked even sleeping meds. It made me comfort enough to sleep through most of the night. I'm not sure if it was because it made me drowsy or it took away the pain but it’s really a life saver,7
"December 15, 2021",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain:,"This is my break through pain drug for occipital and trigeminal neuralgia attacks. And after brain surgery, I took this around the clock for months for the nerve pain. It took my pain level from 7 down to 2 in about half an hour and lasted 4-5 hours. I could tell when it was time to take another dose. I carry a packet of the powder form in my wallet for neuralgia emergencies.",9
"August 2, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Muscle Pain:,"The Tylenol bottles are way to hard to open for someone with arthritis in the hands. It's bad enough that you need to turn the cap to lineup the arrows but then you need to pry up the cap with only the small arrow to push on - there should be an easier way to open the cap. Tylenol cold even include a non-safety cap on the box. Pharmacy's provide non-safety caps and Tylenol could should also. Until they figure it out, I will not purchase another Tylenol package!",1
