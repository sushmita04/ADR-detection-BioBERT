"April 5, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I'm 72 years old, living in New Zealand, which is in lockdown for Covid-19. I started with dreadful pain in my face 5 days ago. I managed to get an appointment with my doctor, who diagnosed trigeminal neuralgia immediately! She gave me 10mg Amitriptylene to take at night, & said she'd phone me the next day. 
I managed to get about three hours sleep, but still had the pain attacks. She rang, & decided to put me on carbamazepine, 200mg at night for a week, then increasing by 200mg in the morning, and increasing by one tablet daily, if needed. Wow! A wonderful night's sleep & a huge decrease in pain. I can still feel an attack starting, but the pain is getting duller by the day.
This pain is the absolute worst I've ever experienced. I had pancreatitis 20 years ago & I thought that was horrendous, but this is so much worse. Fingers crossed, the attacks will start to decrease now. The only side-effect I have is being very drowsy, but I can cope with that.",10
"May 18, 2014",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This medication is saving my life!  It really stabilizes my mood.  Before I started taking carbamazepine I would experience horribly crippling depression in the afternoons combined with very strong urges to self medicate with alcohol or narcotics.  Now I feel about the same all day, never really up and never really down.  I have no conflicts taking it with Suboxone. I have only noticed two side effects: nausea, taking it with food fixes that, and increased sleep.  I sleep longer than I did before and wake up feeling tired.  Actually it helps me to sleep through the night, which isn't all bad.  After I get up, take my other medicines, and have some coffee I am ready to face the day.  Note: I was previously misdiagnosed with major depression.",9
"October 15, 2014",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"When I was first diagnosed, I thought I was dying. I take this (200 mg) - 3 times a day with another medicine. I have been pain free for 7 months. I stay drowsy and stagger at times but I can deal with that as long as the medicines continue to help me.",10
"June 12, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I take tegretol for Trigeminal Neuralgia  in the V2 or maxillary nerve on the right side of my face. When I 1st started taking tegretol I thought it was a wonder drug I could again speak with my mouth open I could chew I could laugh and smile but the side effects have become more than I can deal with and the TN is back super sporadically and hanging on for longer than before per attack. It seems the game has changed. I  now  experience longer more painful bouts and my motor skills are severely compromised. I forget common words while speaking. I walk into door frames. I think I need to see a neurologist. I don't want to be a guinea pig to other medication or treatment.,
"March 2, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I had severe nerve pain in my face on the right side that just came out of nowhere. All of a sudden it felt like an electrical wire from below my eye down to my upper lip was burning.  The pain was excruciating. It lasted anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds at a time. It happened about 50 times a day. Sometimes I couldn’t even talk or open my mouth it hurt so bad.   After two weeks I couldn’t take it anymore so I went to my primary care physician, and he prescribed 200 mg of Tegretol twice a day. I started by just taking one in the morning and that was all each day. After the second day the pain was totally gone. He didn’t give me any refills, so I’ll probably have to go to a neurologist and find out what I need to do.",10
"February 20, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"After two dental crowns in which they had to cut my gums to get the crowns on, I started with constant pain. I kept going back to the dentist and he diagnosed me with TMD. I spent a fortune in physical therapy before seeing an oral surgeon who did a panoramic and found my disc looked good. After multiple visits to my family doctor, I was referred to a neurologist who diagnosed me with TN2. After two and a half years of constant pain, I was finally pain free taking carbamazepine.  It took a week before it started working and then it lasted for five days and now the pain is back. I don't know if I can continue teaching which requires me to talk. I have taught for 22 years.",7
"December 19, 2013",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on this medicine since late September of this year (2013). I was on Abilify since I was 7 years old. I am now 21. I have gone from being a stick figure to a 254 pound blowfish and I'm 5.9"". Since being on Tegretol. I have lost over 20 pounds and am eating less and am more on average scale of what a human being should be consuming on a daily basis. I love this medicine. It helps me think clearly meaning I am much more calm and stabilized with my bi-polar. The ONLY complaint I have is I am constantly having heat-flashes. I am male by the way. I have asked many different psychiatrists, pharmacy, and my PCP about it. None have ever found that to be part of the side effects. I rather deal with this then major weight gain from Abilify.",9
"May 18, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I think Tegretol (Carbamazepine) is a wonder drug for trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) pain. That being said, the side effects are horrible. I was doing well on it-- but suddenly, the spaciness has returned with memory loss, intense lassitude, drowiness, weight gain, constipation; I am going to have to reduce dose. Not sure whether to notify doctor(s) first, or not (as I plan to do it, anyway! as I simply cannot function.) I guess I will leave them a message with office staff; it's impossible to get a doctor to call back. I plan to reduce it by 100 mg slowly the same way I started which was to slowly increase the dose. However, I will only reduce it by 100 mg., until I can see doctor. Wish me luck!",7
"June 25, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"June 12, 2017 I was dx with Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) after an emergency trip to my dentist thinking I had a tooth, gum or nerve issue on June 4th. Dentist put me on 500 mg antibiotic and I was taking 650 mg of Tylenol. Nothing! Terrible pain, I wanted to chop my head. The pain had me in tears  crying out.  My Dr. put me on prednisone and I was still  taking  650 mg of Tylenol every 8 hours. Nothing. Then she put me on Carbamazepine,  along with the other meds and I stopped  the antibiotic. After 5 days I could breathe again with only a ache. People thought I was crazy when I told them having relief  for an ache was a miracle.  But it is, I live by the clock on my phone so I do not miss a dose, I live in fear that the pain will come back in full force.",
"September 7, 2012",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I found Tegretol amazing. It made me so calm and stable even after a few days, the only issue with it is it makes me very drowsy and a little disorientated. That's the one side effect I've noticed. So if you drive a lot or operate heavy machinery or are a surgeon this is not the medication for you. Otherwise it is a great mood stabilizer.",9
"April 24, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I've been on Tegretol for 4 days. It has taken me from excruciating pain to dull soreness. It's a wonder drug. I'm sleepy but almost pain free. I'm lucky that I was diagnosed after only six weeks. I'm praying it lasts!,10
"February 9, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Well im very impressed and happy others have  Tegretol works, i am adhd and bipolar yup try that on for size its insane. I use to be an extremist of note but tegretol has controlled this and what i like most its not like the other medications it does not put you on just another high or a buzz, you don't realize what it does but the people around you do. It slows you down to a more controlled state and keeps the depression down. For me combine tegretol with healthy eating no dow etc rice starch, lots of water and gym and youll be sorted no doubt.But always remember like any normal being there are ups and downs and if you realize life is not always peaches and cream, and that you will experience down time, accept  and just let it pass.",10
"October 12, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I had a horrible experience after being prescribed Tegretol while in the hospital to treat my bipolar disorder. Within a few days of starting it, I began experiencing the shaking, nausea, etc. but the worst was the extreme anger/irritability I started experiencing. It got to the point that I would have horrible rages and felt like I was completely losing control. I kept asking my doctor to take me off the Tegretol, but he wouldn't. During one of these rages, I ended up fracturing my wrist because I hit a door so hard. After that, he agreed to take me off of it. After talking to other patients, I found out that a lot of them had similar experiences with this uncontrollable anger. ",2
"March 27, 2013",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I was initially put on Tegretol only to have it stop working after about 3 weeks.  Dr. added Neurontin and eventually had surgery to remove the blood vessel and wrap the nerve.  Best of luck to anyone with this terrible condition.,6
"March 10, 2015",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I tried Lithium, Depakote, and Lamotrigine.  I had horrible side effects with all three.  But Carbamazepine is a miracle drug, as far as I'm concerned.  It started working within just a few days and I only had to take 300 mg a day, in 100mg doses.  My doctor and I found I had to have 400 mg a day if I took it twice a day, but spread out in 3 doses 300 mg worked.  I always prefer to take the minimum useful dose of drugs if possible.  Side effects: 1) teeth, especially at the gums, seem to be in worse shape on it, 2) I have to drink quite a lot of water, or I start to lose some cognitive function, 3) at a higher dose, I seemed to develop empathy deficits as if I had Asperger's or something.",9
"July 17, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I started Tegretol a week ago for Trigeminal Neuralgia. I was having more and more episodes of TN, and was miserable. Since starting the medicine, I have only had one brief episode of pain. I have had terrible itching since I started taking it. I saw a different Doctor today about the itching, and he said the dose was too high. Hopefully the 100 mg twice a day will relieve the TN pain and not cause itching. I am happy to try the Tegretol, because TN pain is unbearable. Worse than any pain I've ever had (including labor, c-section pain, and oral surgery pain.",9
"April 2, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I have been using Tegretol for 6 months for BiPolar and I have felt happier consistently for the first time in my life. I have tried many others over 15 years and Tegretol has changed my life. I have had no side effects! Go Tegretol!,10
"January 26, 2014",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Thought I would share my experiences on ""Tegretol"" too.  I have been on Tegretol for 3 days now and can tell a HUUUGE difference! I have not been given the ""full blown"" Bipolar diagnose yet, I think this will need some more in depth conversations with my psychiatrist. Well yes I was given Tegretol as a mood stabilizer on Wednesday. I took the first 100mg before I went to sleep. The next morning I didn't really feel any different, it was maybe in the evening or the afternoon that I noticed an improvement. I was a lot calmer, my thoughts were gathered, this has been the case until this day. I will ask my psychiatrist to up the dosage of Tegretol but it's early days yet. All in all I love this medication.",9
"March 7, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I only took this 1 1/2 days because I had a severe bad reaction physically, but the second evening I was on it I felt so calm, peaceful, and happy, that I didn't even want to fall asleep knowing it would be gone in the morning. I would've given it a 10 if not the physical reaction. I really recommend trying this mood stabilizer for anyone with bipolar and it works in just a couple of days. I was just an unlucky one, again.",8
"August 27, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia for almost 8 years thinking that I was having tooth problems. Since my symptoms would come and go, I never did any further research and accepted my dentist's explanation that it was just sensitive teeth. This time, I couldn't accept that and decided to research further. Thank goodness I did and thank goodness for Tegretol! After being on it for only 2 days I am experiencing almost total relief! TN was the most painful experience of my life. The only down side to the medicine so far has been some light-headedness, which I am hoping will diminish or go away completely.",9
"May 14, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I've been using CARBAMAZEPINE 200mg twice a day for about two years. It does a good job in limiting the amount of pain I have with Trigeminal Neuralgia. I found it best to take the medication regularly. If I skip days when I am not having problems the pain will be right back and it will take several days to get it back under control. I've tried GABAPENTIN 300mg and OXCARBAZEPINE 150mg but they did not help. The CARBAMAZEPINE makes me tired and sleepy but that is a lot better than the pain.,8
"August 5, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"After 5 long years of incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary dental and ear surgeries, I was finally diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) about 12 months ago and put on 3 x 200mg of Tegretol daily.
I have had horrific side effects with serious changes to my menstrual cycle (8 week non stop bleeding) but it is still better than living with the TN episodes that I would have almost daily.
I have recently been having milder episodes and may have to try something else.",8
"January 22, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Loved Tegretol, kept my moods stable, worked well, felt calm and happy and in control for the first time in years,
Until a Dr decided it was ok to mix this with antibiotics along with the pill, and sinus medication, I suffered from TENS, after being told 3 times it couldn't be that I was so suck ended up in hospital for 2 months.
Now I remain untreated due to fear, however, what works or some doesn't work for others.
This worked for me until my body decided I was allergic to it and everything else.
Please be mindful of what you take any medication with!",6
"June 3, 2019",Taken for 10 years or more,Carbatrol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I’ve been using carbatrol for at least 15 to 20 years and have noticed my front teeth are getting loose .
But after my second MVD I AM STILL 5yrs painfree. Except when my brother passed away in Feb 2019, started crying and had three massive face pains so I had to stop crying 
So that was due to strees.

So I keep up to date on my blood test but just realized a side effect is loose teeth which is a VERY small price to pay for no pain",10
"June 11, 2017",,Carbatrol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been taking 200mgs of Carbatrol every day for 8 years, due to TN. My TN is the typical type, stabbing facial pain. I don't know what I would do without this medication. It allows me to live a normal life without any pain and I have no side effects. Sometimes my insurance asks me to use Tegretol because it's cheaper and has the same main ingredient, but I react horribly to it. I'm lucky to I have a doctor that is willing to advocate for me. Frankly though, I would pay out of pocket for the Carbatrol before I would use a generic. If you have TN and don't have a good reaction to Tegretol I would definitely recommend trying Carbatrol.",10
"May 31, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I was put on Tegretol 2 weeks ago, and boy or boy the build up felt like forever but now that it is at 800mgs, I am feeling so much better. I believe I will be going up yet again this week another 200mg and then again if need be, before Doctor tapers me down where it is maintainable. I am still having just a bit of breakthrough pain a few times a day, which is nothing compared to where I was 2 weeks ago. I would gladly take the tired, stumbles and slurs over where I had been. This medicine works, and works well!  I pray it doesn't stop working for me, ever!",
"November 29, 2012",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,This medicine brought almost instant relief for a very painful neurological condition caused by a root canal procedure that went bad.  I suffered for two years before someone suggested this medicine.  After 4 doses I was free of pain and continue to be.  I understand I will be on this medicine for life.,10
"August 15, 2015",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been on Tegretol for about 7 years which has been good with manageable attacks I between, it took 2 years before I was diagnosed in which time I had the fillings on the right side of my face replaced 3 times looking for the cause!
I have now been in an attack for the last 3 an half weeks and at last have some relief , am now having double my dose 800mgs  but still have a slight electric shock feeling and my top and bottom jaw ache slightly, I am getting a referral at a London hospital to check my teeth , just to make sure they are ok, but it is just like when I was first diagnosed. Wind or air con are worst for me. This is an awful illness, and do hope you to will get the help that you need,",8
"September 3, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Tegretol for 8 days now, I'm very happy with the results so far. My mood and energy seems to have improved.  I'm taking Tegretol 200mg twice a day along with Prosac and Ambien for my insomnia.  The only side effect so far is a little bit lightheaded, but no biggie.  I have begun a journal/to do list and I'm very happy when I cross off the items I have completed, in addition in my daily journal I'm drafting my daily feelings and my accomplishments.  I would highly recommend this as this is helping me out tremendously.  My memory is not as sharp and this HELPS big time.",9
"February 11, 2021",Taken for 10 years or more,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"About 2005 I got small shocks on my face and of course I ignored them had to go to work.  Then was outside in the heat 2006 and I had a pain when my front tooth hit together. 
Of course I thought it was my teeth. 
My dentist said it's not my teeth. Go
See a neurologist. So I saw my neuro. 
And he said it was either MS or trigeminal neuralgia.   After tests. Lucky me it was both. He told me to start my MS meds and medication for the TN. I lived with the shocks that were building up in size. Til one day when my parent called ttyt he neuro and he gave me carbamazepine 200mg. It took half an hour to stop the pain. Been taking carbamazepine now since 2008.
I find I have not been able to live my life with out it. I'm taking now 800mg.
Then I found out I have osteoporosis. 
Tried to switch medication because of it. It won't let me. I tried all types of medications. Broke four bones so far. But I have to live with it now.",10
"October 23, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Tegretol for 15 years and it definitely controls the hypomania and rapid cycling, though not the depression so well.  It sort of leaves you feeling flat, but I had tried lithium, Depakote, and a few of the atypical antipsychotics and they were too heavy duty or left me with extreme weight gain.  When I went on Tegretol I have 50 pounds of extra weight from Depakote....it came off within 4 months.  I am not thin now, as I have gotten older, but I suppose it is still the drug for me.  At this stage of the game I don't feel like trying other meds as I have to work and function.  I also take a small dose of Lamictal too.",8
"February 18, 2008",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,my son age 5 has used tegretol for the past 6 months for bipolar disorder - it has shown a great improvement in his mood changes and has allowed others to accept him more. if the tegretol is not given we notice a huge mood swing and rage and depression becomes more apparent.,
"December 8, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I was having severe attacks several times a day and within two days on tegretol they stopped. I still get very minor twinges at times from trigger areas. It has been two weeks plus now and I can still recall beginning to brush my teeth and ending up on the floor, so I would be happy if I retain this level of control forever.",9
"March 5, 2017",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Diagnosed a year ago. The tegratol helps with the pain massively, reducing it to more of and ache. My g.p has me on a step up and and step down routine so I'm not in them long term. It's working for me at the moment",8
"June 14, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I had a very good experience on Tegretol. I had no side effects and was feeling better within three days. On top of stabilizing my moods it also reduced my fibromyalgia pain by a good 90% (which also helped my mood a lot).  The only reason I stopped taking it is because I'm working on becoming pregnant and it does have some nasty side effects there.  The new medicines I'm on don't work quite as well and I plan to go back on Tegretol as soon as I have a child.,10
"April 23, 2016",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"First time when I took Tegretol, it worked immediately and the pain went away. The pain comes and go every year and the most importantly the pain was not bad last 4 years that I did not even take Tegretol.  This time the pain is unbearable so I'm on Tegretol. Even with the medication still feel the shock once in awhile. Definately feels better with Tegretol. The side effects, for me, sleepiness, weight gain, excitement with no reason.",9
"August 26, 2016",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I started taking Tegretol 500mg every night after dinner. Initial ten days were extremely tough....very sleepy and was sleeping over 12 hours a day. Slowly there was some improvement but still very lethargic, struggling to concentrate, do day to day activities. Going back to doc. for a reassessment. The pain is down almost 70% and has given me some relief and relaxed me a bit.",7
"February 9, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"The first time I felt TN pain on my right cheek I thought I had been hit by lightning. Second time I started looking for stray current. Carbamazepine ER (extended release) definitely seems to be helping reduce the frequency of the shocks unless I was coincidentally entering a remission. I was prescribed 2x/day. This gets me through the night, pain free, but not through the day. I split the dose into 3x/day which seems to work better, but still not enough: I end up slowing down, sitting down, and biding my time until the next dose.

Getting through the day is going to take a higher dose or other strategies. Looking at facial pain and seizure/ epilepsy web sites has given me two tips to help medication effectiveness: 1) eat something to keep blood sugar from getting too low, and 2) choose foods that are low in glutamate such as pears, apples, corn, or rice.",8
"June 5, 2019",,For Bipolar Disorder:,The carbamazepine has been a real life saver for me. I was hospitalized with psychosis and mania. I can get a racing mind also and/or rapid cycling (manic and depressed). This drug has helped me remain stable. I have been able to raise my son who is now two and even remain calm during tantrums. I needed to increase it many times for significant relief though.,
"March 1, 2014",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been taking Tegretol for a couple of years and it really helps with my bipolar. I can notice a big difference compared to if I'm not taking it. I just don't like how it makes my head and tongue feel numb, but it's a small price to pay.",9
"March 21, 2010",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've used Tegretol for the last three years and it's still working like it did in the beginning.  My moods have been so much better over this time and I have a
lot better outlook now versus the time before I started taking this medicine.  I love these good moods I stay in throughout the day.",9
"March 14, 2013",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Bipolar Disorder:,"This is the ONLY thing that has worked for me.  I was diagnosed with a 'nonspecified mood disorder', feeling totally out of control, no concentration, extremely irritable, suicidally depressed, angry, extremely everything, you name it.  Tried on Lexapro (small effect, then nothing), Effexor (killed my whole soul- left me feeling nothing at all and HORRIBLE to wean off off and gained 30 pounds in two months), Zoloft (turned me into a raging psychotic mess- violently angry ideations, a real nightmare), Xanax (psychosis), self-medication (won't go into that, but obviously not a good idea)....anyway, you get the gist.  This medication gives me NO side effects and just took away my 'craziness' it changed my life.",10
"August 12, 2014",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have spent 17 years with atypical trigeminal neuralgia. This medicine gave me 4 years pain free. It took a long time to work, seems like almost a year, but worked great for a time. Guess now it's on to something else.",9
"August 22, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been on Tegretol for only 2 weeks and it gave me much relief.  Neurontin and Topomax did not work for me.  Only side effect of Tegretol is sleepiness.  I sleep very well at night.  I was prescribed 200mg twice a day, but only take it once a day.  Sometime I take it twice a day if pain in morning is constant.",9
"February 3, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,Worked great on the pain. But my AST levels went through the roof. I am now unable to take them. Awaiting MVD surgery that can't come soon enough. Please ensure your doctor gives you regular blood tests. Mine did not hence my liver problems.,8
"August 5, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I've been living with unbearable pain for 3 years. My official diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia, although I'm still not sure the diagnosis is correct. Like many others, I've had endless dental procedures to no avail. They tried to put me on Tegretol and other anticonvulsants, but I can't tolerate it. The pain went away like magic from the first pill but the side effects were unbearable. It's as if someone hands you a life jacket and then it blows up in your face. I get a horrific state of agitation that lasts for many hours. I have to move, hit, kick, to relieve this madness (akathisia).  My question: can I have relief from pain with Tegretol if the pain is caused by something ELSE (such as a dental implant, in my case)? Or is the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia definitive if the pain goes away? Thank you.",5
"October 13, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"When I was first diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia I was in lots of pain. Pain medications did NOTHING. But Epitol worked but I was continually upped on the dose to keep it working. At the highest dose my Dr would give, 1200mg a day the pain still came back AGAIN. Finally a neurologist added 25mg of Amitriptyline and lowered the Epitol to 600mg a day. I've even lowered that over the past few years to just 400mg of Epitol a day and still only 25mg of Amitriptyline at night. I've  also used Carbazamepine (the name brand) and Epitol (the generic) both work the same for me.",8
"July 11, 2010",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Tegretol has slowed the rapid cycling I was experiencing with bipolar.  I have noticed improved mood.  I currently take a large dose, so I experience side effects.  It's my only complaint about the drug.  I would recommend anyone who is considering Tegretol for Bipolar to have a backup for depressed mood, as I don't feel it's effective for extreme low mood, mainly for bipolar mania.",8
"June 20, 2013",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,There is nothing more scarier than that first few seconds when your seizure starts and nobody is around. Tegretol has saved my life! I am so thankful my doc put me on these tablets 200mg three times a day and I'm happily seizure free.,10
"January 12, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been on Tegretol XR for about 3 weeks now for Trigeminal Neuralgia. I take 100 mg 2x a day. It took like two days for it to work. I only start to have pain from the attacks when I'm due for my next dose. And it's not nearly as bad. The only problem is that I'm already on pregabalin for fibromyalgia, so the Tegretol added makes me totally out of it. I can't remember things, I'm double drowsy all day, I zone out, and I don't like that it has negative interactions with about 500 medications including Tylenol, which I usually take for breakthrough pain because ibuprofen doesn't work on me. So overall, it helps but I really hope I don't have to take this for a long period of time.",8
"April 6, 2016",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Diagnosed with TN (glad to learn about it and find out I'm not dying of a brain tumor or something) - the pain is horrific.  I've been on the generic form of Tegretol (Carbamazepine) 100 mg 3x per day for 3 weeks.  I still have episodes of pain a couple times a day, but at least I can walk around, talk and eat without the excruciating pain I had been experiencing.  Only downside is I feel like a zombie - tired, and ""out of it"" - but like others have said - I'd take that any day over the near constant pain I was having.",8
"June 20, 2016",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I started taking Tegretol for TN and it did greatly improve my ability to function. Pain was much duller during episodes and had stopped being totally debilitating. 
6-7 weeks after use I began to be so lethargic I couldn't get out of bed and was relying so much more on my husband to see to our toddler son. It was very worrying. I then developed severely enlarged glands under my chin, lumps on my neck and started to feel generally unwell. I then had a full blood count done and it returned a very low white blood and abnormal looking cells also. Enlarged spleen also occurred. Now being referred to haematology and had to be taken off Tegretol as they believe I am taking quite a severe reaction to it.",5
"April 21, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Schizoaffective Disorder:,"Tegretol is very effective for my mood swings and hallucinations. It helps slow the racing thoughts and hyperactivity and thinking people are out to get me and helps with hearing voices. When I do not take it, everyone can notice a huge difference in how I act.",9
"October 24, 2012",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Caused me to be very drowsy all of the time, sleeping about 16 hours every night and I developed an itchy rash of red pimple-like bumps on my scalp and neckline and middle of my back after taking it for a few days.",2
"August 2, 2015",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I currently take 300 mg of carbamazepine a day. 100mg in morning and 200mg at night. Which is hard for me to remember the different doses because this medication causes me to forget everything. I also had really bad nausea and hot flashes when I first started taking it.  I quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol on this drug. Super amazing accomplishments, but on the other hand I have lost three jobs in six months. Before tegretol I was taking 300mg of seroquel XR a day and it made me a completely unemotional zombie. So It's hard for me to control myself sometimes because I'm feeling all these things I haven't felt before . I hope tegretol can work for me though and be my miracle drug, because changing meds is my living nightmare.",8
"March 22, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been using tegretol for 6 months , 200 mg a day two times. Before this I started with abylify and it did not help me. I feel much more normal than before and I don't feel like I am going up or down anymore. But  I think one of the most important thing is also not using alcohol and sleeping 8 hours a day.",9
"August 5, 2016",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Reading all your testimonies gives me hope. All though a few of you have had a bad experience or no relief at all. Majority seems in favor. I was recently diagnosed with TN. Never heard of it, also never felt pain like this in my life. Wakes me up, only eat when I'n starving, haven't been to the gym in 3 weeks. I've only been on it for 3 days and so far no change. I guess it takes sometime to get into your system. 100 Mg 2 times a day. Not tired or dopey at all. Seems like the people with the higher Mg have those symptoms. Well wish me luck. One thing I just recently discovered, if i'm looking down I start to get that twitch in my lip. Then I lean my head way back as I was lookin in the sky it seems to calm down.",1
"January 24, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Was diagnosed with TN pretty swiftly after about three weeks of face pain one week of which was worse than giving birth! Was put on 100mg twice a day and after one week the pain subsided. I was very happy. Only side affect was a terrible drowsiness most of the day but better than the pain. However by week three (still on only 200mg per day) I started to feel very unwell. I felt like I was dying. I got terrible fever and the drowsiness got so unbearable I could hardly walk. I got a mouth ulcer (never get them) then another. I could hardly eat, felt nauseous, dizzy and very unwell. Finally the doctor ordered a blood test and he then called me up a couple of days later to tell me to stop taking the drug immediately because I had an allergic reaction and it had affected my liver. Off it now and feeling more like my old self. Luckily the TN has subsided and hopefully it won't come back for a long time. If it does I won't be taking Carbamazepine again.",5
"March 29, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Diagnosed with TN about a week ago.  I tore a Cartilage in my right knee, which I thought was painful. Well, nothing compares to TN, rather have a daily torn cartilage than this terrible pain.

Ended up in hospital being given Morphine, Diazepam, and a Diclophenac Suppository, which is not the most enjoyable method of administration.

Doctor has prescribed Tegretol. This has provided some relief, in as much the frequency of the episodes has reduced, but not the severity, which has not been attenuated in any way. At least I can function better than last week. Though now I do feel a bit zombiefied, and as I am unemployed looking for work this does give me some apprehension how I am going to cope with pain, sedation, and interviews.I am a Brit",5
"August 17, 2014",,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I was previously diagnosed with major depression with severe anxiety attacks. I was taking anti-depressants and anxiety medication for 3 years. My mood would vary greatly throughout this time period. I was self medicate until one night I tried to drive myself off of a bridge with my car full of people. I realized at that point I needed help and nothing was working. I call my therapist he suggested that I go to the emergency room.  I did. I ended up getting admitted for attempted suicide.  After a week in the hospital it was apparent I was bipolar and in a episode. I suffer from manic and depressive episodes. They put me on Tegretol XR and I began to be able to actually sleep a whole night and think normally.,9
"October 29, 2010",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Well, I would say that the side effects, when you stop talking is like so.
I feel like I'm shivering inside, one of the worst feeling in the world. So bad that if I miss a dose, I'm waiting at the Pharmacy before its open.
I suggest that one doesn't miss a dose.",7
"November 10, 2017",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have been on tegretol for seven years now,I still have general pain with the occasional flair up of unbearable pain that I had before taking this medication.  I am also on a high dose of folic acid as I became very anemic, this caused tiredness.  It was just by chance I was diagnosed with TN after being in extreme pain for over 6 months, many doctors and tests one specialist just said it could be this, let's try this drug it may not work but if it does we are on the right track.  To be honest with you if she said I needed to cut off a limb to ease the pain at that point I would have asked for the knife.  I was miserable the pain was unbearable and so was I.  I do feel it is not working as well after all these years may be due for review.",9
"June 20, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,Diagnosed with atypical TN after lower orthognathic surgery 20 months ago.  Now on 1000mg Gapapentin 3x a day plus prolonged release Carbamazapine 400mg at night.  Did start 100mg Carbamazapine in the morning but had problems with vision and balance so decided against it. Drugs working ok.  Wish there was a solution to my problem :-(  Now just been told by my doc that my white blood count down possibly due to the Carbamazapine so may have to come off it.,8
"April 26, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Diagnosed after an auto accident and air bags smashed me in the face and broke my glasses.  Pain of the trigeminal neuralgia was 3 to 5 minutes each time it hit and was as everyone on here describes , indescribable. 
This drug worked but I continually had to keep increasing the dose from 200mg to 600mg and on occasion 800 to 900 on bad days. 
Have found great success with this drug combined with an acupuncture regimen, this combo has stopped the continued progression/escalation of pain and has me living on about 600 mg daily sometimes as low as 400mg. The reduction has helped with drowsiness and I am not quite as scared regarding the continual progression/elevation of pain and meds. Just hope it lasts,  every bit of reprieve you can get counts for a lot. GOOD LUCK ALL",6
"October 4, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Bipolar Disorder:,"The best thing since sliced bread.  I was on lithium, depakote, seroquel and other drugs I can't remember.

"March 12, 2012",,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"It worked OK but had a dramatic effect on my mental capacities. I was in the aircraft business and it got to the point where I felt I was becoming a danger to my customers and myself because of my inability to remember. The day I couldn't recall my favorite grandson's name was the day I quit taking it. I underwent a radiological procedure (gamma knife surgery) at UAMS in Little Rock, that cured the problem. I only have a mild flare up occasionally but it's nothing to what I used to suffer and is usually short-lived. I would recommend this procedure to anyone. It's painless and effective and was a God send to me.",6

But as I got older, add on drugs were needed. Then in 2014, I could not stop eating. I was always hungry, yet loosing weight. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. And I was put on medication for that. In 2016, my doc took me off tegretol and replaced it with lamictal. Once off the tegretol, my thyroid started to function normally. And medication for my thyroid was no longer needed. It’s not a bad drug. But your body changes over time. Another negative about the drug was how frequently I had to urinate. I would have to go at least 15 if not more times a day. Towards its discontinuation, I was on  1200mg of it daily.",3
"July 23, 2014",,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This medicine has changed my life.  For years, before I was diagnosed... I had no clue what it was like to live with a clear head.  I'm able to think and act more rationally.  The way I've always wanted to and never could.  This medicine solidifies for me that treatment CAN WORK.  Changed my life.  I'm a happy girl.

No pain, clear head etc. A week and a half after starting the medication, I had a horrific TN episode for twenty hours. The pain was so bad it woke me from sleeping. I'm not sure whether to go back to Dr's for an increase or just put it down to allowing the meds to do its thing. Can only wait and see.",9
"March 8, 2009",,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,Although the side effects can be very difficult to deal with but the pain of Trigeminal neuralgia is far far worse.  This last attack that I had with the disorder put me to my knees begging to die so I started my Tegretol once again and now 6 days into it no pain at all.  I am very nauseated and extremely dizzy but I will take the side effects over the pain any day of the week.,9

Suffered on and off for decades from head/facial pain with no diagnosis. Finally went to good neurologist. Tried gabapentin. Didn't work at all. (Neither does Dilaudid) This does make me groggy still and I have nausea, brain-drain and more. I would take any side effect for relief from that horrific pain.  I've had it so bad, I literally couldn't breathe in. The break through pain I now gets is mainly an ache in my ear and sometimes teeth. The side effects also may be from the 15 other meds I take for various problems.",10

"September 29, 2020",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I am 71 years old and experienced severe face pain last week so my first port of call was the dentist. I asked him to X ray all my teeth and give me a check up. The X rays showed little difference to those taken 5 years ago and a thorough examination of all my teeth showed no problems. That evening I tried to eat scrambled egg and the pain was excruciating when I tried to bite down on the food. The next day I managed to see my GP, explained all my symptoms and was given a prescription for Tegretol 100 mg twice a day. I took 5 in all. The pain is  gone,  dizzy and confused I nearly fell down the stairs. I started to feel sick couldn't face food. I stopped taking them after 4 tablets and will wait to see if pain comes back. I am not sure if these pills can be taken sporadically or over a period of time to work. I am scared of this medicine as my mother-in-law who also has TN warned me that the medical profession has doubts about the safety of this drug.",3

Carbamazepine was prescribed. After increasing the dosage incrementally, 800 mg a day (500 in the a.m. and 300 in the p.m.) it  controls most of my pain. I still have touch sensitivity issues if I run my tongue over my lip too hard it sets off shocks. One thing you need to note: you may have to play around with the dosage and time of day you take it to control your pain. The first suggestion by my neurologist (100mg three times a day) didn't even touch the pain. It was only after I kept insisting that it wasn't working, he turned me loose to trial and error, on my own with an upper limit of 1000mg per day.",8

I started taking the carbamazepine that afternoon. 100 mgX 3 a day. No strikes after 2 doses. I regret telling everyone how wonderful it was working. The last 2 few days I've had 1 small shock a day, I've started to feel pain in my nasal passage. I got a shock this evening about 7. I'm worried the meds going to stop working.

Lightheadedness, unsteady on your feet -going for a walk with my friend the other day I MUST have looked like a drunk. TBH -this time around I'd rather have the nerve pain.",

I am at 1200 mg. I can not live without this medicine. I have TN on both sides of my face. As soon as the shocks calm down I will slowly try to back off the medicine back to 900 mg where I was a month ago. Moving back and forth between doses makes my balance off and me feeling sick.

"August 21, 2020",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I thought it was a toothache happening in my right upper jaw. My partner recommended me to see my doctor we who referred me to a neursurgeon. He recommended surgery. I had the surgery and the pain was gone for 5 years. Then out of the blue the pain hit me. My home Doctor  issued carbamizepine but it took awhile to to take effect. They started to work and I was pain free for about a year. Suddenly pain returned. I increased the dosage but it still hasn't helped. The pain happened when I went to wipe my nasal part of my nose on right side. The shock went from there to my cheek and eye area. I was taking 2 pills in the morning and 1 pill at lunch hour and 2   in the evening. Shocks happen in the morning and now they are unpredictable. I seen the doc and said to add one more at lunch time. I thought it may be from drinking coffee as it has caffeine in it.

It would just paralyze you.  No indications on when it would happen.  I have been on carbamazepine for about two months and it has work fantastically.  It did make me a bit sleepy and unsteady in the beginning, but that has waned and now I really do not have any side effects. I do sleep better at night than I did before I took it.

This can't be correct,  because I can barely function due to being extremely sleepy with this drug. I had taken Carbamezapine for so long and it worked 11 on a scale of 1-10.

Started on a low dose of carbamazepine, 200mg a day & naively I thought this would make the pain disappear.  No it did not.  They gradually increased dose to 300mg three times a day & this worked for approx 8 weeks.  I thought I had found the dosage that would work for me & I would be pain free forever, but no the pain returned last week & it was excruciating, could hardly eat anything.  I increased my dose to 400mg in the morning, 300mg in the afternoon & 400mg at night & gradually the pain has disappeared.  Spoke to doctor today & I can increase dosage to 1600mg if needed & she will prescribe slow acting carbamazepine as well.",6
"December 1, 2013",Taken for 10 years or more,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Been taking for 10 years. Just had a bad 3 months and it took 1600mg for 3 weeks to control it. Now back to 1200mg and am reducing 100mg every 2 weeks. I was down to 600mg prior to this. A very heavy cold set it off this time. For some strange reason, 1 x400mg tablet is far more effective than 4x100mg tablets. I am in UK so no insurance and little cost.",9
"March 27, 2012",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"Have had complex partial seizure disorder for over 40 years.  My main medicine that held me for years was Phenobarbital.  When I started having breakthrough seizures, Tegretol was the secondary medicine that has held me okay for the past 4 years.  I tried Tegretol XR first but for me, I felt very tired, some dizziness, poor memory, and very bland.  When the Dr switched me to regular Tegretol, it was totally opposite!  I felt alive again, memory sharp, out riding horses, happy as a lark and felt like my good old self.  People should know there are many different medicines for epilepsy these days and also that there is a Tegretol XR (long-acting).",9
"January 31, 2017",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"Trigeminal Neuralgia started about 6 months ago. Started the Carbamazepine about 3 months ago and have been having the dosage steadily increased to 200mg 3x/day with an additional 100mg at night. Pain is easily triggered by the slightest touch to right side of my face and I can avoid that for the most part during the day but night time is bad. The effectiveness of the additional 100 mg at night lasted 2 days and pain is just as bad again. At 61 years of age with multiple health issues and on disability because of COPD, not sure how much of this I'm going to be able to take.",7
"September 29, 2016",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I got the TN problem 3 years ago. Initially, thought the problem is with my teeth and did a root canal.
It was not necessary and diagnosed with TN. Tegritol helped to reduce the pain to a manageble condition. I took 400 mg 3 times a day. But that much of medicine everyday made me feel so drowsy.
So, I read about the chiropractice and started doing the adjustments and started doing brisk walking everyday for 4 miles. With this for an year, The medication is reduced to half. Now I am taking only 200 mg for 3 times! This is a good improvement  in my case and want to continue the same, until I stop taking any medication to reduce my pain completely. Hope this helps many who is going thru this mega pain to reduce the medication.",8

"November 10, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,Just out of hospital blew up like a balloon had very bad reaction. In hospital for 3 days was on tabs for 4 weeks  so am off them now. No good for me as I was swelled up like a beach ball on them. A neurologist told me to go on them for 8 weeks gees after 4 weeks ended up in hospital taking 3 to 5 a day.,1
"February 9, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"My problem started with severe uvetis/iritis (inflammation of the iris) for which I was under a eye specialist care. This went on for almost 3 yrs before the Dr was able to get it under control. I lost a lot of vision the the left eye (it was in both eyes). Eventually I became aware that I had tested positive for Lyme disease in 2005 but was never treated for it. I continued to have severe pain around the left eye that was incapacitating. I finally found a Lyme Dr. after much pain, agony, & suffering. I was told I had trigemial neuropathy in my left eye. I was given carbamazepine 100mg x2 per day. I have only been taking it prn but after reading other peoples experience I believe I need to take it every day to get the full effect . Thank Yo",6
"May 24, 2016",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,This was the best medication I have ever had.  I take 2 at night and 1 in the morning.  I only trouble I have had was at one time the Doctor tried to up me to 2 night and 2 in the morning and it caused terrible vertigo like feeling.  I couldn't even stand up.  Overal I would say it's a great medication.,10
"December 2, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Peripheral Neuropathy:,It took approximately 3 months for the Tegretol to have any effect. When it did it was almost overnight. Also found that taking Xanax with it helps tremendously (with Doctor approval of course). I take up to 3 mg Xanax with 3 times daily and 200 mg Tegratol 2 times daily.  It really works.  The burning has almost ceased.,6
"October 25, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"Tegretolol is the only medicine that stops my tonic clonic seizures. I've been on it over a year, taking 1,000 mgs a day. The first month I had memory problems and drowsiness but that went away fast. The biggest side effect I had that never went away is severe depression caused by it. My depression is gone thanks to Lexapro 20 mg a day. I highly recommend Tegretol for tonic clonics seizures due to Epilepsy.",10
"October 9, 2019",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Epilepsy:,"This stuff was horrible for me, did not stop sleeping siezures and side effects gave me such a bad attitude,  I was very grouchy but was numb to most feelings for other issues.

"January 9, 2021",,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Hi am a lady of 29 years,I have been using carbamazepine for bipolar disorder for a month now.  It is a miracle medicine but the downside of it for me is dermatologic side effects. I have rashes, swellings on face, peeling on the skin, itching of the whole body.  Can someone please help me out how to handle the side effects.I love the medication it helps me a lot",10
"April 24, 2013",Taken for less than 1 month,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,I have been put on this medication for pain.  After 6 mouth operations - I was left with terrible upper gum and palate pain.  I have only been on it for 5 days - it is not working.  The pain is severe and constant.

"April 20, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I was diagnosed Bipolar I with OCD When i was 14. I am now 38 and a mother of 3. I have been taking Equatro/Tegratol XR (carbamazepine) for 3 years now. I also take it with a mild antidepressant. I think on its own, the carbamazepine worked ok, but I found myself still depressed. No more rage or bursts of anger, but zombie like. As soon as my doctor introduced the antidepressant into my regimen, I feel wonderful!!! I take 600 MG a day total of the carbamazepine XR. 1 tablet in the am and 2 before bed. My morbid thoughts have stopped, suicidal tendency went away almost completely.  My moods are elevated and stable now. I am able to enjoy life now.",9
"November 27, 2011",,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"After being on regular Tegretol for about a year in combination with Neurontin, my Neuro changed it to the Tegretol XR with fantastic results.  I have been taking this for about 2 years now and other than the annoying side effects and occasional breakthrough pain I am very happy.  Be warned though that the new generic of Tegretol XR may not be as effective as the name brand. When the generic came out my insurance automatically switched me and they didn't work near as well and I was having a lot of breakthrough pain.  My Dr had to make a request to my insurance for the name brand and thankfully they approved it.",8
"February 13, 2013",,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I started taking gabapentin for my trigeminal neuralgia nearly 3 years ago but it gave me alarming mood swings, I nearly hit my wife! This sent me back to the doctor and I was put on pregabalin which was slightly better on the moods swings but became less effective over time. Now on Tegretol slow release (400mg morning and 600mg evening) it allows me to work but in some pain. I tried 600mg twice a day but I slept all day every day for a month. Breakthrough pain can be helped by taking tramadol and Co-codamol although only slightly. Overall good but it will leave you sleepy and forgetful - don't forget it's job is to slow the neurons in you're brain (I believe it was originally developed for epilepsy). Don't expect to be completely pain free and good luck.",8
"December 31, 2010",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"I am 39 years old now, and have been on Tegretol since I was 20.  I have not had a seizure for 19  years.  Then, this past weekend, I went on a trip and did not take my Tegretol for 3 out of the 4 days I was there.  The next day, I had a grandmal seizure and the ambulance came.  I attribute it to becoming complacent and it really bit me, but I will not make this mistake of being lazy and not taking it again.  I was on 200 mg for the last 3 years without a problem, but will increase it to 400 mg just in case.  Tegretol really does work wonders and I hope to be seizure free the rest of my life, if I can faithfully stay on this medicine.",10
"June 4, 2012",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on Epitol for a little over 6 months and it has CHANGED my life. I had a hard time finding a medication that didn't worsen my condition or give me weird side effects and so far, I've had NONE of that from Epitol.  The first few weeks were a little difficult as it made me kind of tired but I quickly adapted and no longer get drowsy. (I still find it best to take it before bedtime). My depressed symptoms are all but gone and my manic spells are much more mild (though occasionally longer). This medicine was a God-send.",8
"December 31, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I only started talked Carbamazpine 6 days ago after the Dr told me I ""possibly"" have TN. My symptoms of extreme pain in my teeth/jaw on one side started a month ago only when I have something to eat/drink that isn't warm or if I breath through my mouth. I am only on 100mg twice daily and have had only a minor side effect of a very slight feeling of ""spaced out"" rarely though. The meds seem to have reduced the severity and length of the pain already but I'm hoping a trip to my Chiropractor can help even more. I will let you know how that goes.",8
"May 8, 2019",Taken for 10 years or more,For Epilepsy:,"I would advise if you are taking tegretol on a large dose, say 600mg or 800mg twice daily. Ask for a thyroid serum blood test and testosterone levels as it will lower testosterone levels and damage the thyroid.",1
"September 20, 2009",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I have trigeminal neuralgia and have been suffering from it for quite some time. I was put on 300 mgs twice a day and it didn't help at all and the attacks were just getting more severe and frequent, so the neurologist upped it to 900mgs a day. Still no relief! I have been on two other kinds and pretty much have to rely on pain medication which doesn't even relieve all the pain.",3
"September 7, 2015",,For Peripheral Neuropathy:,"A neurologist prescribed carbamazepine for my wife to treat persistent pain in the area of her surgery (brain tumor). She was on this drug for two months and it did not have any affect on her pain. It did almost kill her so BE VERY CAREFUL if you take this drug and have side effects such as low energy, drop in blood pressure, dizzy spells, etc.  This can be a dangerous drug - in our case it depleted sodium levels and my wife almost went into a coma.

"December 24, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"This medication is awful. It is horrible I felt like my life was slipping away on it. Gave me mood swings, I had sad thoughts, I was dizzy, nauseous, and tired. Carbamazepine is so toxic please don’t take it. It even lowered my white blood count and I got really sick, I visited the ER 3 times. I was so lightheaded and so nauseous. I felt like I was going to pass out any second. If you're on carbamazepine please go do blood work and make sure everything is ok.",1
"November 23, 2014",,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Before this, I'd been ineffectively diagnosed and treated for ADHD and recurrent depression. I've taken this medication for only four days following a bipolar II re-diagnosis, but despite this, I feel much better than I had on Prozac. My combination of irritability, depression, lack of motivation, and suicidal/homicidal ideation (in the form of intrusive mental images) has vanished, and I find it much easier to talk to people and look them in the eye again. I'm taking 200mg tablets twice a day and initially noticed mild dizziness, headache, and sleepiness, but these quickly vanished.

At first nothing except feeling drunk for the first 4-5 days. Then it started. Withdrawal symptoms, increased pain, restlessness, insomnia, fatigue and nausea. Not sure if I can continue treatment but will find out on June 24 after my doctors appointment. Also taking meloxicam. Will let everyone know my results Friday afternoon.",6

"January 23, 2021",,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have bipolar disorder with psychotic features. About 2 years ago my symptoms became worse. Constantly shifting between mania, depression and psychosis. So I decided to try meds again. 

I immediately began to feel better. I was experiencing auditory hallucinations and extreme paranoia for months following a psychotic break. This medication made all of that go away. 

I don’t feel my mind going a million miles a second, I don’t get as overwhelmed, I can handle things more easily at work and home, I’m calmer, more patient, and it also really helps with anxiety and sleep. It kind of just keeps me on keel. 

I don’t have any side effects from it at all. Overall this medication has saved my life. I don’t want to ever stop taking it! I currently take 200 mg ER in the morning and 400 mg ER at night. I find ER works best for me since the IR version seemed to wear off kinda towards late afternoon.

It has greatly reduced the tinnitus and vertigo, though I still get it if I lean over or lie down on that side.

I had tried Lithium, Depakote, and a few of the atypical antipsychotics prior to carbamazepine and the thing I loved about this drug is I did not gain weight on it, in fact after coming off Depakote and on to this I lost 40 pounds.  So for me it is weight neutral.  I have heard others say otherwise...some gained, some lost, some stayed the same.  My serum sodium does run slightly low, and I am sometimes tired, but that is the mainstay with psychiatric drugs.

When I first started on carbemazepine, I could tell the difference within a few weeks. My mood swings became less volatile and it gives me a ""buffer period"" between actions and my reactions so that I am able to think about what is happening and react in an appropriate way.

Over the years I've noticed its effectiveness wanes. Increasing the dosage causes dizziness and doesn't seem to solve the problem. However I have been tried on 3 other seizure medicines and they did not help at ALL, so I feel I have no choice but to stick with the rough journey on Carbatrol. Its crazy how epileptics have to FIGHT to prove their disability.",8

Once we figured out what we are actually dealing with, I went through   several medications  (including lithium). They had such severe side affects that they were cancelling out any good they could of possibly been doing for me.. that is until I found carbemezapeme. It took me about 6mo-1yr to really figure out the correct dose, but with the help of some great Dr's and therapist (and THAT really is the key, it can't just be about meds, good Dr's and the right meds go hand in hand) we figured it out.",9

I find it isn't hugely noticeable however, it stops me getting a little too excited/frustrated and function better at work. No noticeable side effects at this dose. Taking 600mg dampened feelings such as love which I didn't like. I then stopped it but became prone to being a little too passionate again. So I started a very low dose which doesn't do heaps but I think it helps. I don't think it will change the world but may stop huge manic outbreaks. Not sure about hypomania though.",7

I used to consult ortho docs since I did not not know what it was. They kept telling me I had muscle cramps. Because I do martial arts I believed it. But at last I consulted a nuero when once I had a bad attack and the ortho doc was on leave. He diagnosed me with exercise induced paroxysmal dystonia. He prescribed tegretol and I started on a low dose. It didn't seem to help me. I gradually increased its dose and now I don't get those attacks! I have no family history of disorders but one cousin with epilepsy.",8
"August 30, 2009",,Epitol (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Works very well in stabilizing mood. I need a very small dose twice a day, and I haven't noticed any side effects. Except maybe acne.

I am able to focus and accomplish tasks instead of being scattered and all over the place.",8
"July 30, 2011",,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I am Bipolar I, and have ADHD. The doctor told me it would take weeks to notice the effects. However, after the second dose, I noticed that my explosiveness was gone. My disproportionate rage to the event had disappeared. I love this medicine and will never get off of it. I take 200mg twice a day, but it feels like it lasts around 6 hours in me. So, I'm going to ask the doctor if I can take a 3rd pill per day. It's great! AND I don't feel drugged at all.",

My first day on this medication was extremely brain foggy, trouble concentrating and very sleepy. I was already sleeping excessively to begin with, which is something I was needing help with. The first night I took this I slept for 14 hours, which is actually way more then I usually do. I also didn't really feel like myself taking this medication, it kinda sucks the life right out of you. I would reply slower to things, take longer to think of responses, and all in all lack the normal enthusiasm I usually had. Now, as far as my mood swings went, I believe I have a mild case of bipolar. My doctor prescribed me 200 mg twice a day, which I've just been halfing",3

After diagnosed I was so thankful that I had never received the continuous one… until today! I had an MRI with contrast today. I  tried to breathe shallow through most of it. When they went to take me out, I could smell patchouli. This is one scent that has always brought on my gag reflex.  I was already holding my breath trying not to cough as I am still sick and swallowing brings on the shock unless I lean my head down and hold still. I was trying to set up and the shock came on and did not let go for 3 minutes and as I tried to breathe afterward it came on again for another 2 with no letting go.

own disclosure because I was terrified once I read that this medication is known for ""drug-induced liver failure"". Not to mention it interacts with almost every other drug I take. That is not something I want to risk and am very upset that my doc didn't disclose this to me. He didn't even run a blood test to check my liver enzyme level prior to starting treatment so thats a whole other conversation but the point is I do not like this drug and would advise everyone to avoid it if you can.",1

Now I take Gabapentin, and today my doctor added Lyrica and I can't seem to get any relief. Has anyone tried any of the surgical options to get rid of this horrible, painful disorder?",6

In emergencies, the inject Toredole and that tamed the pain. But now it tames the pain in my temples only.

I thought I was taking the Tegretol for my mouth burning constantly from the Trigiminal Neuralgia and Migraines and thought I'd give it a try to drop down to the 600 mgs to see if it made any difference. Since last MOnday, my right toes are burning constantly again, and I've had migraines caused from the Trigiminal Neuralgia. I am DEFINITELY CONVINCED Tegretol along with Cymbalta have been my saving grace from pain. The two, together are almost stopping my pain completely in my head AND MY FEET.

"August 16, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Epilepsy:,"Prescribed for my epilepsy and was consuming this along with keppra for 3 years. 

I recommend carbamaz to be taken for people with mood problems instead of epilepsy.  Because it doesn’t really help prevent your seizures, however it helps maintain your mood. 
My seizures never stopped and the medication was useless for them. Didn't even help with anxiety. 

Sadly, dependency rate starts increasing after 8 months of daily usage, more dosage is needed every 6 months and its withdrawals where so hard on me. 

Never had a problem with bipolar or anything like that, however carba’s withdrawals really messed up my sleeping pattern and mood (depression and anger). Eventually, my epilepsy got worst due to carbas withdrawals effect.

 I blame much of this on the Dr who did not listen to me as I described my extreme changes via phone caused by Keppra.  I gave up on pdoc and got   someone to take me to another hospital out of town where they determined I  had keppra toxicity. 
Three Dr's stated it is a miracle I am alive!   A toxicity specialist said it would take me a year to recuperate I was so ill, it did.

There are two things that keep this medication from being a ten. The first is the fact that your body becomes resistant to the effects of the medication resulting in a never-ending dosage increase to maintain your results. The other is one of the side effects of this medication is unsteady hands, and that can make certain tasks somewhat difficult, but as long you follow simple guidelines, this medication in conjunction with another anti-convulsant does quite well at keeping your disorder in check.",9

"September 20, 2009",,For Bipolar Disorder:,I have been on 400mg once a day at night since I got diagnosed with bipolar 4 months ago and I am definitely more stable. I haven't had a manic episode since. I have had a few depressed times but not to the extent of before. Carbamazepine is definitely doing it's job at stabilizing my moods.,9
"September 22, 2021",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I was in hospital for pneumonia when I was, thankfully, diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia. I was given carbamazepine which I thought was a life saver. And it has been for a few years with episodes few and far between. Unfortunately I think I have been taking it so long that is does not have anywhere the same effect. I am suffering so much at the moment it is excruciating to even swallow. Although I do not want anymore surgery (been through cancer twice and luckily survived) I am beginning to think it is my only option. I can very much understand why it is called the 'suicide disease'",7
"September 28, 2021",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Trigeminal Neuralgia:,"I had TN for over 10 years and I also was on several medication, until I was introduced to Carbamazepine. My dosage is 300 mg two in morning and two at night. I’m the highest dosage that you can get, it help a lot and I know the pain that comes with having this trust me it’s not an easy road to never know when you’ll get a flare up.  What you have to do is take your medication faithfully. When I feel a flare up I take one of my pills early in morning and then resume taking the other one in mid afternoon and if you need more mg like the 300 mg ask your doctor and they will prescribe a higher dosage. 200 mg was not high enough for myself do not be afraid to ask for more because you all know how painful this can be and no one should suffer. This changed my life. As for the teacher please don’t feel that you can not teach due to the pain because with more Carbamazepine it will help to ease the pain and help you be able to talk to your students",10
"December 20, 2009",,Carbatrol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"Dizziness for a couple of days as I adjusted to it then again had dizziness for a couple of days as dosage was later increased to 1200mg per day. Slept well, but was tired early and required going to bed about an hour earlier. Took for five years. Unfortunately it did not eliminate all seizures. Had several absence seizures requiring that I change medication.",9
"March 9, 2008",,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"I am a 55 year old male with rare seizures. I have taken regular Tegretol in the past, but didn't like it because of the side effects with fatigue, confusion, and memory loss. I have been on Tegretol XR for the last five and a half months, and have been very pleased. The side effects seem to be much less and allow me to function much more normally. ",9

I started at a low dose 200mg a day and now I'm on 600 mg.  300mg in the morning and at night.  I find that it makes me sleepy but what doesn't.  I am not so sleepy that I cannot function just sleepy when I know I has a good nights sleep.  Anyway,  I am moody and my moods swing from very happy to super mad like many people with bipolar.  This helps we control that.  I does nothing for depression but it's not meant to.  The side effects are very mild.",10
"December 4, 2011",,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Dystonia:,Found it ineffective for facial spasms. Patients must get liver function tests while they are on this medicine. I believe other dystonia sufferers have had some relief with this but I was not one of them.,1

Since then  I have had skin rashes, swollen eyes which initially was diagnosed as ', Prickly heat,' then the last two weeks I have suffered from mood swings, disturbed sleeping, emotional, irrational, hyper activity. My brain never stops working thought not always sensible, nor speech. I do loads of tasks going from one to another and making more work for myself. Had bloods done and awaiting results.

"August 20, 2021",Taken for 10 years or more,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"I'm 47 and was diagnosed with grand mal seizures around the age of 9. Through the years, I was prescribed other medications that weren't effective. I was eventually prescribed Tegretol, but there was the daily ""peak and valley"" with the medication level, which wasn't helpful. Once I was prescribed Tegretol-XR, I felt a million times better! Since taking it, I've been seizure free for about 25 years. My only complaint is that the medication can be difficult to find consistently, and it is expensive.",9

Headache, pain in my neck & shoulders, dizzy, pain in my kidneys,(maybe just pain in my lower back muscles). Couldn't get up out of bed...
Dr (without seeing me) told me through my care coordinater to reduce to 200mg for 3 days then stop all together. 6 days after stopping I still feel really unwell, especially when I just wake up or am tired.

Yes there have been side effects, including, dizziness, confusion...etc. However I am told these things will subside over time. What I do know is I am no longer afraid to live, to leave my house in fear of having a seizure that leads to a deadly outcome. I am willing to fight, I won't stop living and I think Epitol can help me greatly in that way.",6
"May 7, 2015",,For Bipolar Disorder:,I just started carbamazepine today but my sister is very upset with me about it. She said that I listen to whatever someone says.

I didn't get any relieve using it. The only thing I appreciated about the drug was it didn't have horrible side effects. But as for its efficiency in bipolar.....it doesn't work for a long time.",6
"May 22, 2008",,For Epilepsy:,"I am 24 years old and have been using this medication for the past 10 years. My dosage has been increased as my body grew. I have found it to control my seizures very well. I had initial fatigue, head aches, but they subsided after the first couple months. The reason I rated it at 9 is because I have not tried any other drugs, primarily for fear of losing the control Tegretol provides currently.",9
"July 12, 2011",,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Didn't help with my mood swings. I was on 200mg twice daily, switched to Depakote 500 mg twice daily, and I felt improvement in the first 10 days.

I had suicidal thoughts again, I broke out in rashes on my shoulders and arms, my face would get flushed and I started my cycle 2 weeks early.  Which my Dr then immediately took me off of it 4 that last reason.   I wanted a bump up from my 500mg so that's why she prescribed me that. Two 300mg pills a day along with my citalpram.  My dr said alot of her patients love it.   I did not!   Lol. I told her I took one for the team.  Now on to try something else.  Shit.  BTW I'm 35.",1

"July 4, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Was effective for mood stabilization,took 400 mg 2x/day. Went off it because it caused water retention, elevated liver enzymes and mild neutropenia. Also carbamazepine interacts with lots of meds,making them ineffective (i.e. Seroquel) 
Depakote ER is better for me.",6

I felt very ill, had sinus pain, runny nose, headaches and feeling so ill I had to go back to bed every day. By day 4, I was feeling like I had 'flu and, after reading the advice leaflet, decided this medication is not for me.  I do react badly to a lot of medication, so it is not surprising that this one also was a no go for me. I'm in the UK and am over 60, so my meds are free.",1

I started out with taking 300mg daily, I had mild side effects, diarrhea and headaches but they subsided fairly quickly, then my psych Dr increased it to 300mg twice a day. It made me tired and didn't feel like doing anything for about 2 weeks. I slept 12-14 hours everyday and was still tired, then it got a little bit better I guess, with time. I hate getting my blood drawn every 3-6 months to check my WBC, and CBC. I also think its not working so good for me anymore. I have Bipolar Depression, and I also take Viibryd, Wellbutrin XL, Klonopin, Abilify, and Synthroid for my Hypothyroidism. I'm just wondering if there is anything just as effective as Carbatrol but don't have to have blood work done.

I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 16 years and have been on this medication since the year 2000.   It worked better back then, I do have an appointment with a psychiatrist to go over the mediaction as I do not feel that it is working as good as it used to.  Perhaps my body has become immune to it.",6

Well, not exactly...first I was on gabapentin and gained 30 pounds in 3 months. I asked for something else and was given this absolute miracle. I also take Topamax, Vicodin and Verapamil and went from being unable to speak or sleep to a normal life. I've been on 600 MG (200 3x a day) and was just increased by 100. I'm feeling hungry like a wolf for the first time on it. I would do anything to survive this, so it's not a criticism. It's just an observation.

"November 17, 2021",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Tegretol (carbamazepine) for Epilepsy:,"In the early 80's my five year old daughter was being treated by a top children's neurologist for focal seizures which she started having after a severe, undiagnosed life threatening illness at 4 months. She was changed from dilantin to tegretol by this doctor who I had great respect for when I told him the side effects from this drug were harming my child. She couldn't remember anything, she acted dazed and confused, she scared me concerning her development while taking tegretol. We fought over changing the drug which he said was new and better than dilantin. I said I don't care she doesn't act like this on dilantin and I'm not leaving your office until you change it. So now I read these side effects and I was right. I still love that doctor but I knew my child too... And also My other kid reacted better to Rondec syrup for bronchitis than that Albuterol new drug they changed her to, it was absolutely clear to me that while new drugs are wonderful and I am grateful for them, new needs monitoring",3

I have secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and have just learned that it's  common for MS sufferers to get Trigeminal Neuralgia. I started on 50mg Tegretol twice daily which worked immediately and without any side effects and it stopped the painful spasms. I was meant to increase to 100mg twice daily on the third week but I was confident that I would be ok at that dose but on the 13th and 14th day I started to get a few minor jolts so I have upped the dose to 100mg twice daily. The immediate side effect is that it works like a muscle relaxant similar to baclofen or lyrica. I find it difficult to walk or stand but I  can eat without any jolts so time will tell! Take care my friends!,9
