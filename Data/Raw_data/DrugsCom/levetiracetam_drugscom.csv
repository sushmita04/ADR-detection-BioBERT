"March 18, 2021",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,Seven years ago my neurologist put me on Keppra because nothing else had worked to date in controlling my seizures. I gained 100 lbs in a year and had anger blowups. I would not give this drug to an enemy.,1
"May 23, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"over 2 years in now and Keppra is keeping my seizures away but the 2500mg a day has made me a different person for sure .
-don’t feel excited to socialize as much.
-feel fatigued a lot , can easily dose off if not doing anything that requires my attention.
-old memories can bring on strong emotions that normally wouldn’t before 
and memory is not nearly as strong as it was , constantly setting myself reminders for things i should easily remember.",7
"January 23, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"This is the most horrible medication I have ever taken. My usual personality is calm, reasonable, optimistic, positive etc. Well not with this medication. My husband and I have been married for 43 years, we have had our ups and downs but never thought of divorce. With this medication my husband stood by me. What we went  through was uncontrollable everything, crying, screaming, unreasonable, and just plane hysteria. He was a saint, I on the other hand I was totally out of control and could not stop myself no matter how hard I tried.",1
"August 1, 2019",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Absolutely horrible experience. I was prescribed this after having a breakthrough seizure as part of trying new meds. On Keppra my personality changed 100%. I was despondent, hated life, had no motivation and cried at the drop of a hat. Finally, I knew it was time to go to the doctor to transition off when I hit such a low low. Also started hearing voices. Never once did such dark thoughts occur to me until this-I imagine this is what it’s like to be possessed.",1
"March 16, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"This drug is horrific and should not exist and any doctors who prescribe it/refuse to take their patients off of it when asked are just awful. My mum was put on this and within 2-3 days of starting it she went from being a happy relaxed person to having multiple panic attacks a day which continued in severity as the longer the drug was in her system, she also started having very negative thoughts eventually resulting in her giving up her will to fight her underlying disease (which she was actually improving a lot). She passed away 3.5 weeks after starting keppra.",1
"September 26, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"When first put on keppra, things seemed to be fine. But over time, when I had my annual neuro appointment and I’d tell them of any seizures I’d had that year, they’d up the keppra dosage. And the more keppra I took, the more seizures I had. I didn’t realize that till later. At one point I was on 4000mg (?too much?) of the XR version daily. That’s when I figured that the keppra was the culprit to more frequent seizures. And the after effects of a seizure while on that dosage lasted for days. They were major depression, headache and minor after shocks like another seizure was going to happen. In the past three years I’m working my way slowly off this drug. Now no longer on the XR version, just regular immediate release pills. On 500mg a day. I have less seizures. And if I do, I recover from them within an hour or so. One more thing. On the Keppa XR, keppra rage was no joke. I’d be fine. The out of the blue, just all hateful and mad for no reason. Any little thing would set me off.",1
"November 20, 2013",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I had surgery for a benign brain tumor over 8 yrs. ago; Gamma Knife radiation surgery 3 yrs. ago. The Gamma Knife surgery left me with scar tissue that caused me to have my first partial seizure. This required me to remain on seizure medication, levetiracetam. 
To prevent recurrent seizures, I was on a dose of 1,000 mg./ 2x's day. I was on this dosage for over 2 yrs. No seizures, but side effects crept up slowly: bad memory loss, difficulty finding words, fatigue, weight gain. Then, the intolerable ones: deep depression, mood swings, crazy flip-out anger. It just kept getting worse, until I couldn't wait to get off of it! My doctor called it the ""Keppra Rage"". I guess this is well- known side effect that I could not tolerate.",4
"January 24, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I have been using Keppra now for over a year. I have had no side affects from it whatsoever, maybe occassionally my short term memory is not 100% but apart from that I am amazed at it. Compared to the drugs I was taking as a child Keppra has kept me seizure free for over a year now.",10
"November 19, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I'm 25 had my first seizure at 24 and have now had my 4th seizure 11/11/14. I went against the doctor with taking medication as I had and EEG done and came up clear so thought it wouldn't be to serious. However now having 4 seizure I've started taking Keppra twice a day. I haven't been tired by the medication and still able to work well. However I'm starting to be early angered and annoyed and moody. What I would normally get swept under the carpet is now agitating me. I'm not enjoying it as I feel like being left alone and in my own space. ,
"May 12, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Although this drug has paused my seizure activity, I feel like a different person. The first month my mood swings were unreal and almost indescribable. I'd wake up so happy in the morning and be depressed by around 4-5pm. I was and still am fatigued all the time, and little things like walking up the stairs make me out of breath. I also let little things annoy me and unfortunately take it out on the people around me. I have lost 10 pounds since I've started this medication, I have no desire to eat even though I know my body needs food. I feel like Dory from Finding Nemo and it makes me embarrassed at times. My friends will tell me something and I'll completely forget what they said and ask them about it a few minutes later.",3
"March 20, 2013",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I'm French and am 28 years old. I had my first seizure in 2009. My neurologist gave me Lamotrigine for 2 years, from 100mg daily at the beginning to 400mg at the end. The frequency of seizures has been reduced but I still had some.
I arrived in USA in 2011 and my new neurologist prescribed me Keppra because I wanted to have a new medication, more efficient. I take 500mg twice daily. I don't have any seizure since I started this medication, so more than one year now.
I'm very satisfied so far, but of course I have side effects and it's sometimes very difficult to deal with. I'm very tired all day long, I need to sleep at least 8 hours every night. I'm like bipolar, sometimes euphoric, sometimes very depressed.
I'm a different person now.",7
"February 23, 2016",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I've been on every seizure medication invented. Keppera or genetic Levatiraacetam is by far the worst one I've been on. The side effects have ruined my life. I gained over 45 pounds the first year on it. I am now almost 70 pounds heavier than I was before I started taking the medication. I can't work anymore because I have severe depression, anxiety & insomnia. I tell people off for the craziest things & am super paranoid all the time. Despite the that I take antidepressants, anxiety & sleeping meds. I used to be a terrific nurse, winning awards & receiving all kinds of gratitude. Now I can no longer do anything. I am terrified to leave the house, take a shower, clean or go anywhere. I have no life, I just exist. Can't wait to get off this!",1
"April 9, 2015",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I hate this medication! Yes it controls my seizures but it makes me a horrible human being. It causes me to be mean, moody, and angry.I would almost rather have the seizures than have these horrible side effects. next neurologist appointment I am begging for a different medication. And not dilantin or gabapentin either. Both those have given me nasty side effects as well.but what works for one does not necessarily mean it will work for another. Good luck to those of you who are taking this medication. I pray that the side effects are not as bad for you as they were for me.",1
"March 10, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"My 10 year old daughter began on keppra 1000mg per day to control her Rolandic epilepsy. 
The first four weeks were awful, she was aggressive and scary. I needed extra help to stop her attacking her siblings. HOWEVER this calmed down after 4-6 weeks and she I now back to normal. Seizure free (so far) 4 months later. Her mood is back to normal. I would encourage parents to persevere through the first few weeks as it was AWFUL but has improved immensely.",8
"October 17, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I have been on this medication almost since it was introduced, being on other medications that stopped the seizures but had to have blood test every 6 months for liver function, those ones that didn't stop my seizures. Keppra has stopped all my seizure activity with little or no side effects after being on it for the first year. Occasionally I feel the emotional effects of depression, and mood swings but am able to mentally talk myself out of the negative mental state, change the emphasis of what is causing the irritability, and changing my environment ( getting out and socializing, viewing nature, what ever it takes). Overall Keppra holds my seizures from occurring, with minimal effects.",9
"December 16, 2015",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I had my first seizure in 04/04/14 whilst driving and they found that I had epilepsy. The neurologist put me on keppra. It is by far the best drug I've had to take. Initially it was a pain as I was always angry, depressed because I lost my Driving Licence and tired all the time. All I wanted to do was sleep. However, once it took this medication after 6 months, the side effects wore off and I was getting back to my old self again. Happy and all that. I once forgot to take my tablets for 2 days. I had a seizure. Biggest mistake I've made. I always remember to take my tablets now. I'm fit free now. Please take your tablets. They do help.",10
"July 15, 2014",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,My 8 year old was put on Keppra for complex partial seizures.  Except for some initial tiredness in the first two weeks she has had no side effects.  She takes 250mg twice a day.  She even won her age group in a 1mile race two weeks ago and her competitive soccer team won their soccer tournament this weekend thanks to some of the goals she scored.  I have noticed no difference in her school work or personality.  I am so thankful for this medicine that my daughter can continue her active life seizure free.,10
"February 22, 2013",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I am so glad I found this forum!  My husband was on Dilantin and it was working well but a few years ago his Dr switched him to Keppra because it was newer.  He started having severe depression and mood swings to a point where they diagnosed him with Bipolar.  The depression has been getting worse and worse to a point where we almost hospitalized him because I was afraid he may hurt himself.  Today I spoke with his mental health provider and asked about trying Depakote and decided to come home and research if he could take both.  After reading the reviews I am 100% convinced that it is the Keppra causing his depression and I am taking him to the Dr Monday to have him put back on Dilantin!,1
"January 12, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Experienced mood swings, including increased emotionality (crying, anger, etc.); had difficulty falling asleep/restlessness (tired & wired feeling); muscle cramping and joint aches became more frequent, as well as general body fatigue & lethargy; appetite was lowered and indigestion was common; dry mouth occurred regularly; and forgetfulness, attention problems, etc. were apparent. Seizures did not continue while on the 250 mg twice a day dose, but side effects outweighed the benefits. Especially considering I could not take the full 500 mg twice a day prescribed dosage.",4
"April 30, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"46 yr old male. Over 3 month period experienced 3 auras and finally the first seizure in January '13. Prescribed Keppra by neurologist. 500mg x2 daily. Not a hint of seizure activity since being placed on this medicine. However, I do experience some tiredness (mild). Otherwise leading a very normal life style.",9
"September 28, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Worst drug I have ever taken.  Been on it for 4 weeks.  Not even sure I had seizure to begin with.  All tests, MRI and EEG were negative.  Trying to wean myself off.  Dizzy, headache, depressed, severe mood swings, angry then lethargic.  Sorry I ever went to doctor.",
"March 14, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I’ve been on keppra for about 2 years for my seizures and the side effects are on and off. My main problems are I’m extremely short tempered, often very depressed, and most importantly this medication causes so much plaque build up in my mouth. Whenever they raise the dosage on me I have to go to the dentist once a month with issues with my gums bleeding or a tooth being on the verge of being a cavity, and I brush twice a day and floss every night before bed. My dentist was very confused why I had to keep coming in with mouth problems until I told him I was epileptic and on Keppra, my dentist told me of the oral side effects, dry mouth etc.",2
"September 29, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was taking Xanax 10mg for severe anxiety and Ambien 10mg from suffering from insomnia after having my daughter (10yrs ago) I've never had issues with sleep, but unfortunately, anxiety runs in my family. Both stopped working for a while so I decided to take 1 ½ bars a day and 1½ of Ambien a night. One day I decided to stop taking my Xanax and had ran out of my Ambien for about a week. That's where the nightmare began! Horrible withdrawals, feeling useless, hallucinating, kept myself locked up for days then suddenly I began to have seizures and ended up admitted in the hospital about 7 different times. After trying several different anti-seizure meds, Keppra finally worked for me and haven't had a seizure since. Thank god!",10
"January 3, 2020",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Worst drug ever in my opinion!!! 
Here were my side effects- irritability, paranoia, anxiety, nausea, loss of appetite, numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, it would make my aura seizures come more often than they normally would without medication, felt dizzy and light headed, which would worsen during an aura seizure.  Made me get aura seizures when I was still asleep and it would wake me up! Made me feel suicidal also.  I took the medication for about six months and have had more than enough of it. Was  tired each day I could barely get up to do normal things, even to cook. I decided to wean off myself,  I decreased dose to half a tablet in morning, hoping it would stop at the very least my aura seizures in my sleep, but it didn’t help. I then thought after a few months- enough is enough. After taking half a tablet in morning for few months I stopped taking it completely. Never felt better. Wouldn’t go back on it if my life depended on it.",1
"January 31, 2014",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 23.  I am now 35 I was put on Tegretol 500mg twice a day.  For 2 years my life was a nightmare I still got seizures and double vision everyday.  I was then prescribed 500mg of Keppra twice daily along with the Tegretol.  The double vision went completely and I found that I only have 1 or 2 seizures max a year, this is usually because of lack of sleep or forgetting to take my medicines.  Yes I find my attention span is not great sometimes along with tiredness and mood swings.  The positives for me outweigh the negatives.  Good luck in finding what suits you best.",9
"August 24, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,Being on Keppra gave me side effects like living a real life nightmare. I heard voices in my head. I saw demons. People's faces shifted and everyone was out to get me. This drug twisted reality and turned my world upside down in only 11 days. Now my seizures are out of control and my life will never be the same.,1
"July 17, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Started about 1 week ago. Was fine then all of sudden I started feeling really tired, restless. Nothing unusual. Now I have no appetite. Spaced out majority of the day. My mood swings are through the roof. And tonight I had a nightmare. Calling my doctor to see what to do.",5
"June 9, 2020",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I have been on leviteracetam (Keppra) for almost 6 years now before that I was on sodium valporate. In the beginning it caused me confusion, slowmo kind of feeling, mood swings and a typical pressure inside my head. But after 2-3 months the effects started to fade away. And about cognitive ability, I didn't find any change, I sailed through tough competitive exam and achieved my goal. I am more confidant right now, and when I get stress or anxiety I do breathing exercise and it helps a lot. So its not bad for everyone I guess. Stay happy.",7
"November 11, 2017",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I dont like using keppra at all. Since the start of using keppra, I keep on having suicidal thoughts everyday which I don't want to have. Keppra is making my life worse than ever. My mood is changing every minute. It has impacted my schoolwork so much. I have trouble remembering things and being happy. Sometimes I cry so hard  and say to myself ""I can't take this drug anymore"". My self esteem is getting very low everyday. This drug is destroying my relationship with my friends and family. I just want to be able to tell them and my school what my feelings are and not pretend to put a mask of happiness over my face.",1
"August 29, 2017",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I had my first grand mal seizure on a boat and and then a second in the middle of class. The neurologist prescribed me 500 mgs twice a day and then eventually bumped to 750 mgs. I don't think I've had any side effects from this medication and I haven't had a seizure since I've been on it (10 months). I feel extremely terrible for everyone on this review board with these tragic stories. Yet for me I suppose my brain just accepted the chemical.,9
"July 20, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Started taking Keppa (750mg twice daily) alongside Lamictal (250mg twice daily) as the latter medicine was not 100% efficient to control partial seizures. Although the Keppra seems to have stopped the seizures completely, there are many side effects to be aware of. Drowsiness, tiredness and irritability/moodiness are extremely common, so that is often a downer, especially when you're trying to enjoy yourself. Depression is difficult to identify as dwelling on the side effects on the leaflet only makes you feel worse! Overall, an effective medicine for treating epilepsy but I had many bad side effects.",7
"April 7, 2018",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I have been seizure free since 2014. It was two weeks before starting keppra that I had my last seizure so it's been three and a half years seizure free. As far as bad side effects it could possibly have given me attention and memory issues it's hard to say because I don't remember having that great of a memory to begin with but other then that it's been good. I got my license back 3 years ago as I had my second seizure at age 19 and had my license taken away so now at the age of 25 I couldn't be happier. I never look back and think I will have another but I will probably take keppra the rest of my life if it is what is helping me and my epilepsy. I also had allergic reactions to 2 types of anti epileptic medications and then was placed on a drug that wasn't helping my seizures at all so keppra was a God send,10
"July 11, 2015",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I had my first seizure when I was 13 years old. It scared my parents and I to death. After that I started experiancing seizures every month. Almost all of my seizures (except 3) have happened while I am asleep. I am 29 now and all the EEGs and EKGs come back normal. I have been taking Keppra now for 6 months and I have not had any Grand Mal seizures. I take 1000 mg everynight after dinner and I make it a point to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night. I have not experienced any mood swings or depression.  The good definitely out ways the bad.... Many blessings,10
"February 23, 2012",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"After a motor vehicle accident in 2008 I started having seizures. (grand mal) I just started on Keppra 3 1/2 months ago. 1000mg in the morning and again evening. I also take Gabapentin. 300mg 3 times a day. I haven't had a seizure since. (yay!) Not only that, but I feel 'alert' and I don't feel tired. The Gabapentin can make me feel a little sleepy, but after taking it in the afternoon I immediately take a walk outside or take a 20 minute power nap and then I feel great. I haven't had the side effects of mood swings or feeling tired or depressed. I didn't even realize before I started taking Keppra how ""out of it"" I felt at times. I'd gotten so used to feeling tired and 'unclear' in my head. Now that I'm on Keppra, I feel 'alive' again!",10
"November 19, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I had my first seizure on 6/12/16 and it was a grand mal seizure.  The EEG found scarring on the brain from a fall a few years ago.  I was prescribed keppra 250mg twice daily and it was awful.  I had loss of memory which the pharmacist says was due to mini seizures. I. Had to lock myself into my room on several days because I was in horrible form.  I was so angryAfter 7 days I moved up to 500mg twice daily and I must say I have never felt so good,  not in years.  I am in fantastic humour all the time.  I am full of energy.  Even my doctor is shocked.  I know it's very early days for me to give a review but I think it's worth sharing a good experience after reading so manybad ones.  I'm a 34 year old male if that makes a difference to anyone",
"December 1, 2018",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I’ve had 2 seizures, both morning after heavy drinking. Neurologist says I have predisposition to seizures triggered by alcohol withdrawal. I was given Keppra in the ER, and then twice daily 500mg prescription to take home. Effects were generally fine, a little spacey first few days but then pretty much back to normal. Neurologist suggested I move to a 1000mg dose once a day of extended release pills. On their recommendation, I took my typical 500mg standard release in the morning, and then 1000mg (2 500mg pills) extended release dose tonight. Dear god the side effects. My whole body became jittery, I was having panic attacks, and my eyes were fluttering so much I thought I’d have another seizure at any moment. I didn’t, and after 6 terrifying hours I’m mostly back to normal. I will no longer take both pills at once as directed, and will instead spread the doses as I had been with the standard release. I’m going to continue to push my neurologist to ween me off these drugs.",6

He has an extreme phobia of needles and seized before they did the procedure for his back.  The doctors believe it was due to extreme stress but then a month and a half later while at work he had another seizure.  The neurologist started him on Keppra and he has been on it for a little over a month.  He hasn't experienced another seizure but the medication is making him extremely depressed, he seems drunk/high from it, can't walk straight, speech is slurred, eyes glossy, memory loss.  I don't even feel like he is even my husband anymore because it has made him so spacey.",
"December 7, 2016",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"First I had partial seizures (after head injury in 2004) and after grand mal 2014 I almost died because of status epilepticus. After that I am on Keppra 1000mg a day (500mg morning, 500mg evening) for 2 years now. First month or two I had headache and double vision, sometimes I was a bit aggressive 
but after few months it was ok. For me it is good medicine, now i have 10 petit mals a year and I think that bad-heavy weather changes is causing them. 
I want to tell you, that after first or second month side effects went away. For me it is important, that I take Keppra with good meal in morning and evening. It is good medicine, just do not give up.

About 5 months ago I had a grand mal seizure and my family dr. wanted me to see a neurologist since I haven't seen one for awhile. Well after seeing my neurologist she changed my medication to Kappa. I really hate this drug. I would maybe have a few to maybe 4 to 5 seizures a yr. that I could feel coming on, now I have had to many to count in the last 5 months than I have had since I was on Dilantin. All the seizures I have had since I have been on Kappra I have not felt coming on, I am very moody, I feel like crap all the time and over all I hate my life.

"July 3, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,My mom began post stroke seizures and a 1000 mg Nokia was administered in the ER. I explained she was very sensitive to meds. She as admitted and given two more doses of 500 and 750. She was so lethargic and dizzy and nauseous I asked if we could switch. They dropped the keppra cold turkey and she seized 96 straight times every eight minutes. We are back on it to properly wean her but with each dose she seizes like clockwork and has been in cardiac arrest 4x. We are between a rock and a hard place with this med but I would advise anyone to choose this med knowing side effects can be severe. She is on comfort care now.,1

I am having some pretty bad side effects including dizziness, weakness, extreme fatigue, anger, agitation, and depression.  It is tough because I am a single mom and have to work but I go to work and just sit there because I can't concentrate and don't feel like moving.  I am still only taking 250mg in the morning and 250 in the evening.  I was directed to move to 500 in the morning and 500 in the evening after 3 days but I just don't feel like I can handle it.

I asked if there was anything else, I was given Keppra. I felt an almost instant change. I had no more funny feelings in my head, no twitching in the mornings. I felt much safer and that lead to me being much happier. I can stay out later. I've had no seizures since taking this and. I recommend it.",9
"August 15, 2017",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"When I take my dose it makes me more sleepy than usual. It's not everyday, but some days I can be sleepy after 7-9 hours when I have slept enough (approx. 7-8 hours). That's the only side effect I had up to now. So I am ok with it, I guess. Annoying with two tablets 500 mg each day, but oh well better than seizures. That's even worse. Those who had them can feel with me. :)",8

I started taking Keppra and was fine for 2 years with no side affects, no seizures, nothing, then 1 day I had a massive grand Mal seizure the doctors keep upping my dose. Now I am on the maximum dose but still having seizures. Before I took Keppra I had only a few fits in my life now I have them about once every couple of weeks.",5

He hated the way it made him feel.  His neurologist put him on extended release Keppra which cause him to loose 30 pounds within a 3 month span.  He was rushed to the hospital due to high sugar - 564 dl.  In ICU, he was given Keppra at night, during his sleep,  his heart rate would slow down to 50 and set off the heart monitors all night. The cardiologist said there was nothing wrong with his heart after running numerous test.  The medication compromised his system, caused Type 1 diabetes and triggered irregular heart beats.

"January 12, 2016",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,My last seizure was less than a month before starting keppra. I was having very bad seizures on and off for 3 years and the only thing coming up in scans done on my brain was a bit of slowing on the left side. I had tried other anti epileptic medications that weren't working and my neurologist recommended I start using keppra which was newer to the market at the time.  I've been seizure free for over a year and I couldn't be happier. I got my license back a few months ago and have returned to living normally,10
"September 2, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I started having seizures as a teenager.   I have simple and complex partial.  I have found that taking Keppra along with Tegretol XR has kept me stable.  Another part is making sure you know your triggers (stress, flashing lights,  hormonal changes,  illness,  alcohol, roller coasters,  lack of sleep or food, dehydration,   etc and avoiding,  or at least try to minimize them.   The combination of the right medication and knowing yourself and your illness goes a long way.",10

I have experienced some minor occurances of side effects, but nothing compared to the problem I experienced while taking Dilantin, which caused me to lose my ability to reason, and to express myself, i.e. Dilantin made me an apparent idiot.  My greatest annoyance with Keppra is the rise in cost- 46% over these past 4 1/2 years.",9
"June 28, 2017",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I think the definition of hell was the 4 weeks I was on this medication. Every single day I was constantly in a state of panic. If you've had temporal lobe seizures you may know what I'm referring to; the brief state of panic that occurs when a seizure is coming about. I was in that state of panic ALL day. I was in high school at the time and had to stay home nearly every single day. The neurologist tried adding an antidepressant, a xanax, and nothing would calm it down. When my hair began falling out at an alarming rate that was the final straw for me. I had to DEMAND to be switched to something else. I take lamotrigine now and it has completely turned around. My hair finally stopped falling out about 2 months after I quit the keppra.",1

For my husband and I this has been worse than his hit to the head. Major mood swings,can't sleep, can't eat, anxiety and more. It has been horrible. The thing is everybody is different, but if you are taking Keppra and these are happening to you speak with your doctor asap and try something else. It has been hard!!!!",1
"May 23, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was put on Keppra to supplement to lamotrigine due to the pregnancy causing my lamotrigine to metabolize too fast. I immediately noticed an increase in exhaustion which was crippling on top of the pregnancy exhaustion. I could sleep 14 plus hours a day if I had the opportunity.  My husband commented on the change in my personality and how my mood changed for the worst. Keppra wasn’t added until I was 29 weeks, so the personality change was not pregnancy hormones. I reached a point where I started asking myself why I even thought getting pregnant was a good idea. What soon to be mother wants to think that!  I experienced dry mouth and a general feeling of malaise. If it wasn’t for the fear of another seizure while pregnant, I would NOT take this medication. I can’t wait until I give birth to get off of this miserable drug!",4
"February 17, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Keppra not only increased my seizures from 3 a year to 5-7 grand mals a week but also kept me conscious during them so that I was able to feel every excruciating moment. Normally the human brain blacks out during a seizure.
       Thanks to this drug, I was able to feel and remember my muscles tightening and fighting against each other, my head trying to hit again the floor and my legs and arms trying to kick and beat the air. 
        As soon as I was able I switched doctors and medication. This needs to be pulled from the shelves!!!!!!",1

"June 29, 2015",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I was on 1500mg of Keppra (generic) for partial seizures that progressed into a grand mal seizure.  Immediately upon starting the meds, I noticed that things were different.  I felt disconnected from myself, trouble with attention, word finding, coordination, mood, working and longterm memory.  However, I was seizure free and I needed to drive so I pushed through, not enjoying my life as much and making terrible social decisions.  Finally after 4 years, my neurologist is helping me wean off so that I can start a family without worry.  I am down to 250mg a day and WHOA my whole life is changing.

I started Keppra (500mg 2x daily) and haven't had a seizure since taking it (knock on wood). After two years of treatment, I came off from Keppra and had a seizure after 5 months without the medication. I'm back on it, and have been seizure-free for almost two years now. I do have side effects from Keppra though. I'm tired a lot, have mood swings, experience bouts of insomnia, headaches, and dizziness.

I only took it because they said it was the fastest way to get my license back. My neurologist when I finally talked to him didn't want me on medication first. Had multiple tests done everything normal. Neurologist came back and asked if I was still taking the Medication. I stopped taking it because my wife first noticed I was a lot more irritable, then the longer I took Keppra, iIhad no fuse and would just snap at people. I haven't gone on any other Medication since all my tests results were normal. Now I have the neurologist saying I have to be on medication for at least 6 months, which I don't understand for my first seizure and clear test results.

I now take 5- 500mg pills plus 3- 100mg caps of Dilantin. That is 300 mg shy of brain surgery. I am at piece w/ myself. I know what I have tried, what worked and what didn't. My seizures are extreme. I keep my blood level Therapeutic and have fewer seizures so I know it is working. I still get Grand Mal seizures, just not as many. That proves to me it works. That is all I care about, ME!",10
"November 15, 2017",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I haven't had a seizure in over 3 years because of this drug. It has helped me so much in daily life that I can't imagine my life without it. The price is also very reasonable considering what it treats.,10

The side effects that she got when first starting have decreased significantly or are gone completely.  Prior to starting this medicine, she had 2 grand mal seizures and was subsequently diagnosed via EEG with epilepsy.   Since she has been seizure free since starting this medicine I can only say that it does what it is intended to do......cease seizures.  So I give it a definite thumbs up!",8

After a complete rage out I decided to do some research and discovered that taking a vitamin b6 supplement helps to reduce or eliminate this effect.  The results were instantanious with me.

It wasn't uncommon for me to sleep twelve hours a day. 

The real problem with Keppra was the mood swings, depression, anger and suicidal thoughts. It's no secret that a link exists between epilepsy/seizure disorders and some (all) of these issues; however, in my case these feelings and emotions definitely intensified while taking Keppra.",5

I also had post-partum depression from when I had my son, its worsened over those two years. this will be my 5th year on it and im not satisfied with it at all, I've tried changing my medicine but they won't because it stopped my seizures (grand mal) and I've tried telling them about the depression and anxiety but all they asked ""why didn't you tell us this before"" but most people deny the fact they have anxiety and depression (like me) to avoid being put on other meds, I've tried anxiety and depression medicine but nothing worked.

I am trying to convince my neurologists to find an alternative to this awful tablet as I’m now at the point where I have panic attacks even leaving my bedroom, my vision is constantly blurred and flickering and it feels like I have a CONSTANT aura as I get pre seizure.

I got tired of living like that and one day decided to stop taking them, bad move. It was fine for 4 days, I was energized and happy but on that day I had another seizure.

Currently I am on 1500 mg a day or XR medication. On the first time it was prescribed, I never took it for the sole reason that there were so many side effects listed.

That was the first time.
The second time that I was tried on Keppra, I spent a year on probation for assault. You can guess my opinion
It works well for some people, but I fear it's not as safe as the UCB and the FDA claim.",1

I started having seizures my sophomore year of college and am now a senior and I have been on Keppra the past two years. The doctors never explained the severe side effects that would go along with this horrible drug. I used to be always a happy kid and since I started taking Keppra I constantly dealt with mood swings, uncontrollable anger, severe depression, constant thoughts of suicide, weight gain, and hair loss! I can't believe it took me such a long time to get off of this stupid drug. The seizures never stopped either and all the doctors would do is increase my dosage every time. I'm currently at 3000mg a day and am slowly weeding myself off of this drug and going all natural.",1

For the first month roughly I had constant mood swings and almost no appetite. It wasn't uncommon for me to randomly start feeling depressed and those phases could last up to multiple days on end. I would also have random anger that seemingly came from no where to the point where I would start fights with my family over the dumbest things. Even after that first month which is supposed to be when your body gets used to the drug I continually had mood swings and random depression. Although it has stopped me from seizing I highly do not recommend,1

Unfortunately I can't think straight.  My reading, comprehension, learning is shot.  I've been trying college for years, each increase brings better control. I wish I could stop the medication for a few days to see if there is another world out there but my brain gives me an unfortunate reminder if I'm late.",9

Dr. recommended weaning process after normal EEG, which we followed to a T. He relapsed and had a tonic clonic seizure and is back on keppra, 500mg twice a day. He has a reminder to take it at 8am and PM and that helps moderate side effects. His side effects are mostly sleepiness, emotional swings, but being physically active helps a lot.

As an adult now who always feels tired no matter how much sleep I get and feels very unmotivated to do things STILL, I can’t help but wonder if taking these as a kid have affected me mentally. I was always shy but a very hyper kid who liked learning new things and after taking these I just remember turning into a quiet kid who didn’t do much and that’s stuck with me for years. I'm currently trying to fight this but I wonder if there’s anyone else out there who’s taken this Medication and feels this way years after they’ve stopped?",3

However, this drug isn't safe during pregnancy so my Dr prescribed me Keppra (500mg) before we staring to try for a baby. 

Keppra works well for me to control the Petit Mal Seizures. However, it has really bad side effects. It made me extremely tired and quite moody. The worse part about this medication it caused me to have 2 Grand Mal Seizures (10w and 18 w). Before these 2 seizures I have never had a Grand Mal before.  I am now off of Keppra and on Lamotrigine and feel great. I have energy and feel like myself again. Best of all no Grand Mal seizures!",2

Many different symptoms with this I've noticed over the years so I will list a few: mood swings, anxiety, depression, memory loss of dates & time, agitated, lies.

 Talk to the  doctor about the amount of seizures he experienced since last visit and at times gets violent.

Neurologist perscribed me keppra 500mg daily and 2mg xanax a day when needed, usually I break xanax into pieces as u can because they have little bars to do so. I don't have any side effects besides feeling sleepy at the end of the day. I don't take xanax til after work at the end of the day as xanax does makes me sleepy. Keppra deserves 10 for me.

All of my tests came back completely normal, save for slightly elevated blood pressure. I was put on Keppra 1000 mg, twice daily, as a result. I read up on how nasty the side effects allegedly were, but I found my personal experience with them quite underwhelming in comparison. Symptoms are definitely present though, chiefly gastrointestinal discomfort, irritability, restlessness, and feeling ""spaced out"". My most concerning symptom is that it has made it quite difficult to find things genuinely enjoyable like I used to. The best way that I can describe it is that it makes me feel robotic. Symptoms are obnoxious, yet manageable with some effort and patience. For seizures, I have not had any recurring episodes since being on it, so I can't say it's ineffective.",7

My parents and friends will be the first to tell you how drastically I have changed from this medication. It makes you very irritable, tired, depressed, CRAZY mood swings and short tempered. Through the years, I've learned to handle it better. When I was 15 I stopped taking them to see if I grew it out of it, suggested by my neuro, and had 3 seizures in 3 days.

At the 5 month mark, I had a nervous breakdown and spent a whole night throwing hurting myself. After this, I tapered myself off the medication, and my life improved significantly.

I have experienced numbness and tingling throughout my whole body, along with what feels like electrical impulse shocks. I'm tired all the time, trouble sleeping. I can only hope that these side effects will cease because the side effects are making me feel really bad, just the same way as I did with Dilantin I was taking. ",6
"April 15, 2009",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I find that Keppra has reduced my seizures - Grand Mals - but I occasionally lose the ability to reason, wonder where I am. It also has considerably increased my weight. I am on Lamictal also. There is the odd mood swing but I attribute that to Lamictal. My headaches are just about the same. No significant change in using it. I've been on it five years now.",7
"March 10, 2012",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I am on a very small dose for epilepsy 250mg twice a day.  It has made me quite tired, but apart from that there's been no problems. I only have a couple of seizures a year so hopefully this low dose will keep me seizure free.",8
"March 23, 2017",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"So I had times where I'd black out and have amnesia. Basically it would scare my parents and after the second time it happened they took me to the doctor. We went through all the test and they all came back normal except for my EEG. it came back abnormal. I was immediately put on keppra and hated every second of it. I started off with 500mg 2x a day. After the first dose I was hallucinating and very confused. The four hour mark was the worst. I was super loopy and couldn't focus for nothing. the medicine caused me to have mood swings and go into a deep depression. My advice if you have any sort of mental illness DON'T TAKE IT.  I've struggled with Bulimia, Anxiety, Depression, and Bipolar disorder for years. Seizures stopped. Wasn't worth it",1
"February 25, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Seizures:,"I was put on it by a neurologist who never actually tested me for epilepsy. I saw another neurologist who ultimately diagnosed me with  Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), non-epileptic seizures caused by panic attacks. I was put on 500mg twice a day which was fine but after having a miscarriage my anxiety sky rocketed and I started having seizures so they increased the dosage to 750mg twice a day. That’s when the issues began. Joint and muscle pain to the point I see a PT and orthopedic doctor. Anxiety was so bad. Depression set in. Now I’m going through the withdrawals which are the worse Headaches, anxiety, muscle aches, nausea... basically the side effects you get from the medicine but in reverse.",1
"December 21, 2013",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,My daughter is 4 and started having seizures 9 months ago. She has been on Keppra since then. Overall it has worked to control but not completely prevent her seizures. It has stopped them from spreading to her whole body but she still has them in her face about once a month even though her dose has been increased several times and she is now taking 7 mls twice a day. The side effects now are not as bad as when she first started this medicine. Since she has been on it however she has not had as good of an appetite and some days she wont eat at all. Her sleeping habits have been irregular as well. Some times she freaks out and starts biting anything she can. She doesn't talk so she can't tell me how she feels.,7

I have taken 14 anti-convulsants at one point or another in an attempt to control my complex-partial seizures, but Keppra is the WORST medication I have EVER taken. The side effects are horrible. Although it's the only medication that has been able to stop my seizures, the side effects are so terrible that it's not worth taking it. I couldn't string together a coherent thought, had short term memory loss, had awful mood swings, and suddenly hated life. Everything was difficult, I couldn't think straight, and felt emotionally raw all the time. I could barely keep it together while on this medication. Every day of life was AWFUL while on this medication. I will NEVER take it again.",1
"August 17, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"This is the worst drug I've ever been on.

I did have a Grand-Mal Seizure a few months back. It was the worst I ever had. They did a blood level on me and my blood level was Therapeutic, Meaning normal. It is a good medicine to take. But like any other medicine it has it's off days. I do recommend it though.",8
"September 5, 2015",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 17 and was prescribed Dilantin. I was having grand mal seizures and it was working ok. When I was 22 I moved to Florida and saw a new neurologist and he said Dilantin was an old drug and put me on keppra. I'm taking 1500mg twice a day and I'm having more grand mal seizures and partial complex zone outs. Keppra has not helped at all and I'm going to a new doctor for a different opinion on what to take.,1
"April 3, 2018",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"When my Keppra was wearing off, I would start to twitch!  I couldn't stop twitching and I was becoming more and more aggressive!

This has lasted for the last six years. I am very pleased and glad to get rid of those nocturnal seizures with their after effects.

It will make you irritable the first few weeks, but that passes. I have one grand mal seizure once every three months. It's an alright drug if your epilepsy isn't a ""I have one every hour"" type thing. (: Good luck!",9
"April 4, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Keppra was fine for me at first (500 mg twice a day) for 2 months. I suffer from complex partial seizures and experienced a grand mal recently. Then I experienced extreme tiredness, confusion, headaches, greatly increased my depression, could barely go from my bedroom to the living room (never mind managing leaving my house). I had to go back to my neurologist to get switched off such a horrible drug for me. Aptiom (once a day!) so far is a better choice for me.",1
"May 15, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. I would give it zero stars if I could. I lost 4 years of my life because of Keppra. Did not help my seizures, I almost killed myself 3 different times, I had personality disorder, extreme anxiety & paranoia, anxiety attacks daily if not more than once a day. Anger, rage, I was a completely different person. The same thing happened to two other people I know that were on this drug as well. And the withdrawal seizures have been HORRIBLE and have almost gone into status epilepticus twice. But I am so thankful I found LAMICTAL. All of the Keppra symptoms are now gone, and it actually helps me be happy and joyful.",1

No side effects...I'm always angry.,10
"October 5, 2008",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Really is a wonder drug. It almost got rid of all my seizures but they are back again due to a trigger. It kept them away for 3 months, which is a miracle for me. I would get seizures every day for months. It was miserable. Plus this stuff hasn't given me awful side effects like many other anti-convulsant medicines.",9
"October 19, 2017",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Sometimes I feel drowsy, sometimes I feel dizzy, sometimes I don't. I am not sure if it is really part of the medication but I do know I don't seizure on it. Compared to the first type of medication I tried (it sent me loopy) this is a lot better, but it could also be better. -Over the years start to analyse how your head processes, how much do you remember and make sure you're not getting slowly cranky on it.",8
"September 22, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Seizures:,Keppra has worked well for me. I was on 13 anti-convulsants after I first diagnosed in 1965. Over the years the meds were slowly stopped except for Dilantin. I slowly made the change to 1000 mg of Keppra/levetiracetam twice a day ten years ago and cannot sing the praises of this drug enough.,10
"February 5, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for New Daily Persistent Headache:,"I've been using 1500 mg of Keppra for about three years now for a very achy head.  Through an MRI, my Dr. found that I have Cerebellar Atrophy.  As long as I take my 750mg dose at the same time each a.m., I  have absolutely no problems anymore with my achy head that I've lived with all of my life, (til the age of 48). If I wake up late, it's not worth it at all.  I'll wake up with an awful headache, that doesn't go away until about 1/2 an hour after I take the Keppra.  I also take 750mg just before bed.  My achy head is in the past now, thanks to Keppra.",10
"July 27, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Started off using Keppra with Tegretol, and at the regular 500mg dose per day. Later upped to 1000MG per day. Once they removed my Tegretol dose, I began to have violent seizures.

Now I have Tegretol back and my dosage of Keppra was doubled again. Now at 2000mg per day. I'm now depressed, tired, nauseated, and don't really want to eat at all.

I'll have to talk to my doctor about changing my medication.",6

However, till the age of 10 my seizures were  at the times I had fever. However I have never taken any medicine.
At the age of 15 I had 2 seizures in one month's period and in both cases I had menstrual cycle. After that the neurologist prescribed me Keppra of 500g twice a day. Apart from tiredness I had no problem till the age of 19. I began to have diarrhea even 7 times a day and I had any sort of medical analysis. The last option was the medicine: my neurologist only after several times understood this and changed medicine. Now I take matecer (750 a day) and no problem till now.",2
"June 9, 2020",,For Epilepsy:,"I've been on Levetiracetam for about 6 years now and it's controlled my seizures which started when I was 22 years old.

The depression, anger, mood swings and general numbness are too much. I've lost friends and nearly lost a partner. I never used to get panic attacks and now I do. I mistake them for Auras sometimes which just heightens the sense of dread.

Occasionally I accidentally miss a dose and wonder why I feel so happy that day, then it hits me...

I feel like reading these reviews has helped me to come to a decision to change, so thanks everyone. That being said I'm sure this could work for some people, so don't be scared of it as a medication, just be aware that if your mood changes or you start feeling depressed that it's not just you turning in to an awful person and could be the medication.

Also I'm in the UK, so NHS will change my meds for free no qualms. ",1
"August 15, 2011",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I'd been having partial seizures every 2 wks lasting a few days for about 3yrs before having a tonic-clonic seizure and finally agreeing to go on medication. I started on Keppra and the seizures came once a month for about a week, similar to a girl's period, and I became very depressed, suicidal, and uninterested in anything. About 2yrs later I had another tonic-clonic seizure. Shortly after that I switched to Lamictal and am no longer suicidal but am still depressed and uninterested in anything and the seizures now come more frequently and randomly. ",

The remaining tumor is slow growing and is benign. I'm prescribed 500mg of levetiracetam twice a day to stop the seizures.  Until today, I didn't realize that drinking alcohol can induce seizures.  I am a daily drinker. I have had about 6 clonic seizures. Had one April/2020 and they upped me up to 750mg twice a day. Yesterday I had one beer, felt like a seizure was coming on. Have had weird feelings about being outside, a sense of panic, and almost like I'm trying to talk myself into having a seizure. Like I'm barely in control. I would not drink alcohol, or not very much. I believe my was body craving alcohol while sleeping. I never had the anger issues, but recently it feels more like anxiety. Be very careful with the amount of this drug that is prescribed. I can definitely feel the difference since this ""slight"" increase. My son (at age 12) had to be taken off it. His behavior really changed.",8

Thankfully my son was born healthy. Next week I am planning to start to come of Epilim gradually due to constant tiredness, irritability and agitation that is made worse from being on two medications. Will just be on Keppra, hope it works as I have been seizure free for 2 1/2 years.

I was discharged from hospital on 750mg Keppra twice daily but this dosage is not controlling my seizures and I am still having seizures since my discharge from hospital.  I am now waiting for an urgent appointment with a neurologist for a consultation to get me on the correct dosage of medication to control my seizures .

"September 20, 2016",,For Neuralgia:, Originally I was taking gabapentin which helped a little but ended up making my pre existing tinnitus much much worse. I started doing my own research as my doctor wanted to give me Lyrica or Cymbalta both of which are a big no no for tinnitus patients. I stumbled across Keppra and found a few studies done for nerve pain. I also found that Keppra is the only anti epileptic on the market without tinnitus listed as a side effect. I approached my doctor about this and she agreed to let me give it a try. I started off at 500mg twice a day and now take 750mg twice a day. It has done wonders for my nerve pain!

I haven't had a seizure while on it however the side effects are just about as terrible. I was given 500mg twice daily and about two months in I would get pressure and tension feelings in my head while at school or in a social environment, I assumed this was an aura of a seizure about to happen, although with my particular case I never had an aura even before a seizure; 10 months later and I have finally come to realize it was anxiety which made me feel as if i was going to have another seizure which only worsened the anxiety. Due to this intense ""seizure"" feeling I would take more doses of the keppra. This led me to increasing the amount. Due to these symptoms I have pulled away from leaving my house. Two weeks ago I switched to 500mg keppra XR once a day. Started to suffer from actual panic attacks. If you suffer with anxiety or quick temper I wouldn't recommend",4

I did start to gain weight after taking it but I thought that was from the pregnancies or a thyroid issue.  I had no idea so many people gained weight with it and had irritability problems.

I asked to be put back on the keppra I had taken for 6 months prior to being moved to the vimpat. I've been able to run again, and am having fewer seizures (although had one this morning after doing the ADA diabetes step out 23 mile walk and sprinting the last half mile to get to a restroom.
I definitely feel like the keppra is more effective against seizures, still, and doesn't compound the side-effects ",7
"August 9, 2009",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was placed on Keppra in January 2009 by an emergency room physician after a reported seizure, which had no professional diagnosis. A neurologist whom I saw post emergency kept me on the medication as I reported no side effects. I had what I now believe to be a fainting spell related to an atrial fibrillation condition of my heart and a strenuous run, without a ""cool-down"". I am pushing to get off this drug, as I experience dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness and somnolence, fatigue and exhaustion most of the time. I am a 2008 Herat Valve transplant recipient and on diuretics and blood thinners, both required to avoid congestive heart failure and embolisms(artificial valve).",5
"June 26, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Neuro recently added Keppra to my seizure med regimen. I have absence seizures & the 600mg (the recommended max) of Lamotrigine I'd been on for 16 yrs was no longer as effective. Being middle-aged & female, my seizures developed a catamenial (hormonal) aspect to them. My absences would skyrocket at certain times of the month, as many as 60/day. Been on Keppra for 2 weeks & have only had 1 absence during that time! 
As for the side effects: near constant irritibility, sometimes a sense of hopelessness, apathy, & mood swings. More often than not, I feel detached from the world...like I'm just watchin a movie & I'm not a part of whats going on around me. I'm weighing the trade-off: no seizures or constant crazy? Gonna give it a little more time.",
"July 22, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Seizures:,"I started having myoclonic seizure - the jerky kind - when I was an early teenager. They worsened as I got into college with little sleep and probably too much drinking. After learning to control my sleep and adding Keppra, I never have seizures anymore. It really controls the jerks with little or no side effects. I never feel anxious or moody or any of the things that some of the other people are talking about. I only take 250 mg in the morning and at night I have complete control. Last year I thought I could get off and would be better but is soon as I got off the Keppra the myoclonic jerk seizures started again. I learned my lesson and will be on my Keppra for life",10
"September 20, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Started having grand mal seizures about 4 or 5 years ago. I've been on Keppra for awhile now the 1st two drugs made me way too tired. I get headaches everyday and sometimes ""flip out"" (get really mean and mad) easily. I never thought it could be from the Keppra but now I wonder if it is. I have been seizure free though which is worth it to me!",7
"September 21, 2014",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Keppra (levetiracetam):,"I started seizures at 55. I am Bipolar, difficult to treat, rapid cycling I take a low dosage of Keppra and Lamictal. The side effect went away after finally got the right dose. And thank God I'm finally getting off the carousel.
VERY IMPORTANT: I can't take the generics. I got squared around on name brand and went through hell with generics. I don't care what they say generics on my brain had me swinging everywhere because some work, others don't. Since on name brand only. I'm doing great. Good luck all.",9
"January 24, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,Been on this med for a month it’s absolutely a life saver I had been on trileptal and had increasing seizures even in my sleep this med had stopped them completely as well as provided me with the sleep I haven’t had in years not one side effects whatsoever!!!

"January 8, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I've been taking Keppra for almost 3 years for JME. Fortunately it has stopped the seizures but I do get a lot of headaches, which my doctor dismisses whenever I mention them. Other than that I am happy to continue using this medication.",7
"December 4, 2009",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Keppra alone did not do anything for me except make me depressed and have ""Keppra rage"".  I was up to 1500mg 2x a day and would still have a grand mal about every 4 months and absence seizures in between.  My neuro switched me to Topamax, Depakote and everything else but would break out in rashes or have horrible diarrhea and every other side effect.  Back to Keppra I am 2000mg 2x a day (400mg a day total) now, weighing 175 (hell of a dose) and got put on Lamictal as well up to 100mg 2x a day of that.  1 month since addition of Lamictal and higher dose of Keppra and no seizure yet.  We shall see.",4
"March 16, 2017",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Epilepsy:,"Keppra, with Vimpat and Fycompa, has been great for me. We all know that it is hard to find the right combination of drugs. Every Neuro I had diagnosed me with the wrong kind of seizures and therefore gave me the wrong meds.

I highly recommend Video EEG Monitoring to anyone who has seizures that cannot be controlled. After thirty years they finally figured out my problem and I am now seizure free. 

I truly wish all of you the best and hope that your seizures are controlled.",10
"November 20, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Developed epilepsy due to several strokes while fighting sepsis/septic shock about 4 years ago. I am in the middle of weaning off Keppra and moving to lamictal. While I was seizure free on Keppra, the Kepprage, depression, and suicidal thoughts made me think it might be better to take my chances with seizures..hopefully the lamictal will be effective. I also with there was more science behind cannabis, and I lived in a state that allows medical cannabis.  CBD seems like an option to supplement the conventional medications, but I can't say I complain about the occasional ""buzz"" via full spectrum cannabis.",3
"November 20, 2017",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I was on Keppra for about 6 months as an addition to oxcarbazepine. From the first week of taking keppra I had developed a horribly annoying eye twitch. At first I thought it was from lack of sleep but after about three months and the twitch being consistent on 3/4 days a week, after a little research online I realized that keppra was the culprit.  Besides the physical side effect my family told me I was just about unbearable with how moody I was while on it (I was on the dosage of 250mg x2).  My neurologist told me to give it 6 months to see it the side effects decreased over time. Before I reached the 6 month mark I had a break through seizure and that ended my journey with keppra.",
"December 6, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I was on this for social anxiety and I went completely manic, spent a lot of money, did things I wouldn't have normally done. Was I anxious? No, not really, but it was scary not caring about the consequences of my actions.",4
"January 29, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I've been on Keppra for around 4 months now. The only thing I like about it is that I don't feel like a zombie like I did while taking Tegretol. Apart from that it does not really control my seizures and makes me dizzy and forgetful.,5
"August 19, 2009",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I am currently on Lamictal and Keppra.  I've been through lots of changes in medicine since pregnacy and had brain surgery on the injured part of the the brain due to being in a coma as a child. I'm still having seizures, not as often but when they hit they hit in numbers not just one!  I want more options and no more surgery!  And I and my family want the mood swings, anger, agitation, and racing thought to be gone!",7
"November 6, 2012",,Keppra (levetiracetam):,"My doctor put me on Keppra to see if it will help with my problems of completing sentences and being at a loss of words. I haven't been on the medicine long, but the side effects are very apparent. I feel almost drunk sometimes I am nauseous and dizzy and have not noticed any change in my condition. I have to be very aware and on top of my game to do my job.",5
"November 10, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I have sadly had a love/dislike relationship with Keppra. Almost right away after starting it after being diagnosed with simple partial seizure epilepsy, almost all symptoms I had been dealing with were gone. Within a week it was amazing to have a day without constant headaches, feeling dizzy, seeing flashes of lights, etc.

Starting Keppra, it was discussed between my doctor and I and my spouse that it has a common side effect of causing what she referred to as ""Keppra Rage"". Fortunately for me, I did not experience that. Unfortunately, it did cause me crippling anxiety to the point I couldn't sleep with a blanket, and would commonly feel the urge to run outside because it felt like what I would guess a panic attack would feel like. 

Without that one side effect, Keppra would be my best friend. I would encourage people to try it if offered however.",8
"July 15, 2008",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I was put on Keppra as a safer choice while being pregnant. While Lamictal has more studies done I was allergic to it. I have loved being on Keppra. I was drowsy at first but that side effect went away but now I need to decide whether to breast feed or not. So many places say not to I am wondering if anybody has any advice.,10
"March 20, 2017",,For Seizures:,"Levetiracetam is a good drug when I take it with fycompa and vimpat. I am now seizure-free.

If you are tired or feel confused try vitamin B12. This works great.

If your meds do not work have your MD try Video EEG Monitoring. Please check this out.",10

I have taken Dilantin for over 50 years, with good results. It has controlled my seizures pretty well until recently. I was diagnosed with COPD 2 years ago, and in that time, I have been having seizures every 3-6 months. My doctor switched me to Keppra 6 months ago, and in that time, I have had at least 1 seizure a month. I think it's time to switch back to what works.",1

On Keppra I suddenly became an AGGRESSIVE and ANGRY person. I did not realize this at first, but soon realized I was yelling at everyone and have explosive anger towards the smallest circumstances. I was on this for about a month. I have had amazing experiences on Lamictal (Generic: Lamotrigine).",1
"February 20, 2021",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I have been on Keppra  for 10 months post craniotomy to prevent seizures.  Initially I was taking 1000mg per day and then was reduced to 500mg per day. I had my neurologist lower the dose because I was becoming very aggressive.  I was very mean and spoke with no filter. I have not had 
any seizures it's more of a preventive measure. I hope can get off this medication soon.",10
"November 14, 2013",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam):,"I have been taking generic Keppra 4 times a day for over 4 years.  I was placed on this medication by a neurologist to help with tremor and undiagnosed illness (possibly MS).  I have experienced much less tremor.  I also began taking gabapentin about 2 years ago.  I take 600mg daily.  Between the two medications as well as a weekly injection of steroids I have found relief from my tremor as well as my undiagnosed ""flare ups"".  I also have INO and I have many other symptoms of MS but because I have not been able to have a neurologist diagnose my symptoms I remain undiagnosed.  I have had 6 MRI's and 5 CT scans.  I have seen 8 neurologists and I have also had many other diagnostic tests. I hope to someday have a diagnosis.",10

Her neurologist put her on Keppra and for a year she didn't have any seizure. March of this year she had a grand mal seizure and we had to take her twice to the ER. We found out she had RSV and it triggered her seizures. They say it will take 2-3 weeks to clear the virus and the seizure should go away too. Unfortunately for over a month now she is still having seizures almost everyday, sometimes in the morning and at night. We were given Diastat to help with her seizures and also increased the dose of her Keppra, but nothing seems to work anymore.",6
"April 29, 2009",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I was on Keppra for a year and unfortunately I kept having  seizures.

His behavior has also been more labile.",5
"November 15, 2012",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Keppra XR (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"I have had grand-mal seizures since age 7 due to an AVM in my brain. Previously during childhood, I was on Dilantin (major rage problems) and Tegretol (caused liver damage).

This year My neurologist has changed and she wanted me to try keppra but I was happy on the topirimate so I said no until I had a grand mal seizure. However, the seizures have got worse since taking the keppra plus the side effects are awful. At the start I was so tired I spent all day asleep. After the dosage has increased to 3000mg per day I have started to get mood swings, anger, depression, irritability, plus suicidal thoughts and have become a completely different person - I never used to cry but now I don't stop.",1
"March 28, 2010",,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,Keppra worked very effectively on controlling my seizure disorder for the most part.

It has been largely effective at controlling the seizures (I've only experienced two since starting the meds). However, the side effects are less than ideal. I originally experienced intense feelings of anger and depression and would break down on a nightly basis. I tried taking the recommended B6 supplement and experienced little to no relief. My short term memory suffered horribly and I'm able to recall very little of the first year in which I started taking the medication. I now take Zoloft to combat some of the side effects but still experience feelings of anger, depression, fatigue, and memory loss.",5

In-between April and September my moods were all over the place.  It was affecting me and I didn't know why July 20th I ended up in hospital first with suspected stroke ended up partial seizure back in again 9th August after taking 3 seizure they up my meds to 750mg twice a day week later I was hallucination shaking anxiety seizures suicidal even broke my marriage .

Due to no seizures they withdrew the Dilantin but a couple of months later I suffered my first grand mal seizure. I was put on Epilim (Sodium Valproate) but continued to have grand mal's. I had 3 in a week while at the highest level of Epilim and woke in hospital to find out they gave me Dilantin through a drip. They gradually reduced the Epilim whilst introducing Keppra. I was toxic for about 6 weeks but believe it was because the Dilantin level had increased. I have been seizure free for about 6 months now whilst the Dilantin is below the therapeutic range so I hope it's the Keppra. My neurologist wants to have me on Keppra only.,8
"November 6, 2011",,For Epilepsy:,"I began having simple partial seizures in my adolescent years, not knowing that they were actually a type of seizure but rather a result of lack of sleep and stress. I had two seizures in the last fifteen months and was terrified of ever having one again. So I started taking Keppra at 750mg twice a day and have not had a grand mal or simple partial seizure since, which is a big plus. Was drowsy and slept a lot the first couple of weeks but now I'm back to normal. The only major downside is the extreme mood swings; I was always a happy girl and found joy in everything but now I can barely go a day without something upsetting, deeply upsetting or angering me. Hoping to overcome this eventually; I guess it's the price I pay to be seizure-free.",7

"August 31, 2017",,For Seizures:,Keppera is NOT a very effective seizure medicine at all. It has caused me to have more seizures rather than reducing the seizures that I have. It seriously NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET!!! It's caused me to have more seizures on a daily basis & it has caused me serious cardiovascular problems & it counter acts with the Phenobarbital & it counter acts the Atenolol for my cardiovascular problems that the Keppera has caused me & it has also has caused me to have serious problems with balance & coordination & the side effects of the Keppera is NOT WORTH IT TO ME AT ALL! ,1

At first I was sleepy and lethargic, but after 2-3 weeks I balanced out.

At first I had no appetite what so ever and lost about 20lbs after taking it for a month.  I also had extreme constipation that required another visit to the ER.  However, once being on the medication for a couple months, I started to get my appetite back, but I craved different foods, mostly healthy foods, instead of the food I use to eat.  I also take vitamin D, B and folic acid, which I think has significantly improved my mood.  I feel after some adjusting this medication improved my mood, stopped my seizures, lessened my anxiety and changed my eating habits.  I will say I have an aversion to meat.  I can hardly stand to look at red meat.",9

Added Keppra 500 mg to his 300 mg of Zonegran. The NEXT DAY after first dose of Keppra he had not noticeable seizures, but 2 weeks later he had his first and only grand mal.  We took him off Keppra; the absence seizures are back, but no grand mals.  ",1

The first 4 years I experienced little side effects like strange sleep patterns, always tired, and a slight disruption in my ability to concentrate. My seizures were reduced to only 3-4 a year vs. 1-2 a week. In the last five years however the long term side effects have hit me hard...muscle and bone weakness, sciatica, migraines, hair loss, no energy, bouts of rage where I feel outside my body watching a mad woman ( I have always been a calm collected person who never yelled and rarely felt anger), the anger is overwhelming. Suicidal ideation, severe depression, complete lack of concentration, inability to think of words ( which is devastating for my love of writing)",3

I was switched off of Topamax after recording more than 24 side effects on the minimum dosage of 25mg. I ended up being allergic to it, and it was so bad for me. On Keppra I finally feel like myself again. It’s a Godsend for me, personally. I feel like I got my life back.",10
"December 29, 2020",,For Epilepsy:,"Question, question, question your doctor.  I was on Dilantin for 35+ years and my seizures were well under control.  No seizures since 1988.  This year (2020) my neurologist decided as I am getting older Dilantin will not be good for my bones.  My neurologist put me on levetiracetam. I have never taken off brand/generic because there is just the slightest difference.  

Well, where to begin with issues I had with levetiracetam.  I looked, literally, like the walking dead and could count every bone besides the anxiety, moodiness, loss of appetite,  weight loss (30 lbs), snapping at my dogs, cats & family for no reason.  I checked off each & every side effect AND made my own additional list.  Couldn't work because the side effects were so bad.

Severe side effects. Worst med I have ever taken!!!!!",1

They couldn't tell what was wrong with me at that time. At the age of 12 years old I had my 2nd episode in my sleep. I found myself crawling to my parents room because I couldn't walk or talk correctly. When I went to the hospital they diagnosed me with epilepsy. What causes my seizures is an enlarge blood vessel on the right side of my brain. I started off with 750mg of Levetiracetam. I only had episodes when I missed 1-3 days of my medicine. Now I will be 19 years old in April & I am now taking 500mg of Levetiracetam. They're lowering the doses as I get older.",7

After a year, I went down to 750 mg and the following year 500 mg.  My neurologist will keep me at 500 mg until I am 4 1/2 years from my surgery when he will take me to 250 mg for the final 6 months.  At that point, he says I am just as likely to have a seizure as someone who has never had a seizure.  I have no side effects from Keppra, but am looking forward to my 5 year mark when I will no longer have to take medication.",10
"October 11, 2020",,For Epilepsy:,"Been on this medication for over 15 years. I suffer with epilepsy and several types of seizures. would recommend keppra control and prevent upcoming seizures.

I would def recommend keppra for people suffering light seizures or epilepsy consuming medications daily to PREVENT attacks. However, you will NOT be able to rely on it during ur heavy attacks. You would need diazepam Rectal tube or seroquel to immediately calm u down within seconds. 

Advice, pls take note to ALWAYS have an emergency medication as when ur loved ones under a sever epilepsy attack u would be able to help them with diazepam rectal tube 5mg or seroquel tablet which immediately calms them down within seconds - Stops the hallu, anxiety, seizures and calms u down. 

Take note to ONLY take it WHEN NEEDED as those medications are highly addictive. 
If ur on keppra. Stick with it :) Take note that it only helps PREVENT seizures and it has the least side effects :) no depression! Amazing!",9
"March 3, 2016",,For Epilepsy:,"I had a heart attack and had a stent which led to a stroke and the need for brain surgery.  Miraculously, I was saved by a young neurological surgeon.  Seizures followed but the recovery the first 3 months on a lot of different medication made the outlook positive.  Medication was lowered and I started experiencing what we feared were TIAs but was finally diagnosed as a form of epilepsy.  The first medications did not work well until I have been on Levetiractam for 6 months and everything has improved a lot during that period including memory and mood.  I do have the sleepiness at night but not a problem.",9

My neurologist thinks they're ""a strange presentation of clonic seizures in the brain stem"". Weird, but okay. I've been on 500 mg for four days. In that time, I've lost consciousness twice, had three nosebleeds, been dizzy and lightheaded, had constant trouble breathing, had ridiculous mood swings from angry to crying in the blink of an eye, and been unable to walk a straight line.

Also, I was having so many memory problems I couldn't remember anything from 2 mins prior. I had Agitation, Anixiety, Angry Outbursts, I had to Go..I mean go.. I couldn't stay still sometimes I felt like I had to leave it was crazy.. I was loosing my mind.. I had no control I was very Angry lots of outbursts and I couldn't control it!

"August 22, 2012",Taken for 1 to 6 months,,"I am a psychiatrist, and I have found that virtually EVERY person with major depression has episodes of irritability with loss of mental control during which the person often says or does thing which are regretted later. This complex of events is NEVER volunteered as a symptom but consistently confirmed if the physicians asks.  I have found Keppra to be uniquely useful for this complex, sometimes bringing about a near-transformation of the person's quality of life for the better. I start at very low dose 125 mg twice build up slowly, maybe 1/4 don't like it and stop, after that I've had no adverse reactions.  About one in three or four improve very dramatically, the whole quality of life is better. ",10

This is my fourth brand of AED in 6 months as the side effects are so terrible. I have had epilepsy for 42 yrs and only since being on AEDs that I have been this bad.

"December 2, 2011",,For Epilepsy:,My 9 year old daughter takes this 500mg 2 times a day and it does lower the seizures by a few but not enough for the major mood swings she has been having. She is happy 1 minute and like the flip of a switch she is so angry and hard to reason with. Six medicines and not one has made a change for the better.,2
"October 22, 2016",,For Epilepsy:,"At present I am taking Lamotrigine 25mg four times a day.  Due to some speech problems during the past six months it was decided that I should change to another drug called Levetiracetam.
I have looked up the side effects for this tablet and find that the tablet has more side effects than Lamotrigine.  What makes Levetiracetam any better to use when the side effects are horrific.

"December 20, 2008",,For Seizures:,"About a year ago I was having constant headaches. I was always yelling and screaming at my wife about everything. I finally got it checked out. One doctor said that I was just depressed and wanted me to take depression pills. I sought a second opinion. It was discovered that I had a cyst in the temporal lobe of my brain. I was started on Topamax, which didn't really help. So my neurosurgeon switched me to Keppra. My attitude made an instant turn around from the third day I was taking it. My appetite is back and my wife and I enjoy each other again. The cyst is still there, but I can live with it if I have my medicines.",10
"March 8, 2009",,For Seizures:,I have been taking Keppra for 1 week now and have only had the side effect of drowziness and dizziness but there is one thing that's not on here that I have and it's a bad taste in my mouth. All the time a lot of things will make me sick if I eat them like chicken and pork they have a sewer taste in my mouth no matter how bad I brush my teeth it wont go away. I don't take any other medicines besides keppra. I have epilepsy and used to take depakote but was taken off of it when I was 18 because of weight gain. I have not had a seizure in 5 years then I got them again the doctor put me on keppra and told me it will help.,7
"May 27, 2009",,For Seizures:,"I've had seizures on and off for about 12 years and have tried Dilantin, Depakote and Tegretol. When my generalized seizures started up again this past year, I started back on Depakote, but that didn't do it. My doctor suggested Keppra and mentioned that it was filtered through the kidneys rather than the liver like the others so I tried it. I've increased the dose from 1000mg/day to 2000mg/day and so far it hasn't completely controlled my generalized seizures. Overall, this drug only seems to interfere with my concentration a little and I'm just slightly drowsy. ",7
"October 10, 2011",,For Seizures:,Our 11 year old takes this medicine for unknown seizures that occur several years apart. She seems to be very tired and irritable. She's moody to the point of insulting and disrespectful for no apparent reason. These things did not occur until she started taking the Keppra.,5

I have been on many medications for my seizures and I've noticed that levetiracetam works best for me. I was on Dilantin for a few years but the seizures just got worse.,8
"April 13, 2009",,,"I have been using Keppra, in addition to my other anti-seizure medicines, for about six years. It has been great but the generic has been horrible.

"November 6, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Epilepsy:,"I've been on an ever-increasing dose for over a year now; this med doesn't want to stay in my system. I'm currently at 2k mg/day, and it still doesn't register in the blood test as a therapeutic dose. Despite this, even when I first started at very low doses, I had immediate reactions. Some very bad; killed my immune system and I got a cough so bad I cracked 2 ribs. Some very good; somehow, my long-distance vision improved. Neurologist suggested I'm in a state of ""near-constant aura"" from migraines and this med reduced that, along with some facial numbness I didn't know I had until it went away. Seizures are controlled while it's in my system.",10
"January 28, 2010",,For Seizures:,"My 4 yr old son started having seizures a few months ago. All the tests have been run and still they cannot find out what is causing them. They diagnosed him with epilepsy and started him on liquid Levetiracetam (Keppra).  Side effects were hyper-ness, not-focused, anger, rage, frustration, hard to fall asleep at night, out of control.  His UCLA Pediatric Neurologist prescribed him Lamotrigine (Lamictal) starting with a really low dose and increasing every week.  So far with decreasing the Keppra I can see a difference, and so can his teachers at pre-school.  This month January 2010 he has only had 2 grand-mals and a bunch of petit-mals. So far no side effects from the Lamotrigine. It's a day by day process.",3
"May 23, 2009",,For Seizures:,"My mother, 84 years old, was prescribed levetiracetam 250 mg twice a day for seizure related to Hypertensive Vascular lesions (multiple small infarcts). She said that she has taken her medicines(anti-hypertensives) but perhaps it was wrong and in the evening her blood pressure rose so we started medication under total supervision. Today, she had mental confusion. In the evening, she failed to recognize her daughter-in-law who came to see her. In the evening, she again tried to take away medicines on pretext of ingestion but we were careful. From next day, she gradually became normal. ",
"March 16, 2021",Taken for 10 years or more,For Epilepsy:,"I’ve been receiving this medication for years, I take 1000mg twice a day.

Every bottle I’ve received from the CVS store is cut short one 2 tablets.
When this happens it throws my refill off by at least 2 days. Sadly now I’ll be short once more. 
I received a letter stating my insurance will not be covering this script. How in the world will I survive without my seizure medication. Currently take two different medication to keep my seizures under control. Can you please explain? CVS says my script will cost over 1000$, there’s no way I can afford to purchase this medication.",7
"October 8, 2021",Taken for 10 years or more,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Epilepsy:,"Keppra has been the only thing that controls my seizures. It is dangerous at higher doses. It gave me suicidal fantasies and a bi polar like personality. When I lowered the dose I feel more stable with a joy for life, but I am so fatigue 24/7. After taking it 20 years my memory is shot and I am scared I am going to get early onset dementia. However, an Epileptic has to think about surviving each day without having a seizure in a dangerous circumstance that could kill or seriously injure themselves and others. So although Keppra is not perfect by any means and it will take a lot of experimentation for the right dose, it gave me the best chance at a normal life, seizure free.",8
"August 18, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Seizures:,"I had 5 (what we think are seizures) spread over three years.  Each one resulted in the dislocation of one shoulder or the other.

After the fifth, I accepted a prescription for 500 mg tabs of levetiracetam. to be taken twice a day, morning and evening.  I purchased them, but cut the tabs in half, so I was taking only 250 mg twice a day.  This is half of what the MD recommended.  After three years, I have had no additional seizures (dislocations of my shoulder(s).  So, I guess it is working.  I have experienced none of the advertised side effects.  So I guess I am satisfied.",10

I took It for about 2 years I had missed a dose and ended right back in the ER. After that I made sure I took this medication everyday. I had no bad side affects and never went back too the ER. This one worked well for me. I am sorry too hear about the bad side effects it caused other users.,10

I don't like it or the moods I went from add ADHD hype kid to sitting around doing nothing it's like take the meds to sit down and chill motivation reducer and mood swings if I could have never started the meds and have a seizure or 2 a year I would have did that instead taking all these meds everyday to miss 1 day and guaranteed to have a seizure is just backwards hard to move around freely taking all the meds,4

Not helped 'Absent' or 'Nocturnal Seizures'! Would take any 'Med' to avoid Sleep-Wandering, biting Mouth to shreds & various injuries when awaken. Keppra = No Thanks..The SIZE of the Tab's are scary enough, increased anxiety, zombified 24/7, terrible lethargy, that KEPPRA RAGE & negative feelings as others have described.. (Tegretol, Clobezam + Zebinix are helping more tbh)

"January 22, 2022",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was on 3000mg per day for complex partial seizures ,mainly having absence variation. It only took a week of taking this stuff before horrific nightmares started occurring. Normally a very peaceful person and virtually nothing could upset me. On keppra more like a ticking time bomb. I distanced everyone from myself and went into complete isolation so that when the keppra rage came on no one was around. When it would hit it was literally like the rage and anger seen from the incredible hulk. Extreme anger and I felt I could destroy anything. Normally it hit during the night so I would grab on to the mattress tightly sweating profusely in a rage . Many times that would follow the horrible nightmares. I wound up quitting my job cause I couldn't function in the workplace while still having absence seizures and going in and out of consciousness. Don't let your neurologist convince you to go on this drug. It can have devastating effects and they will make no mention of that beforehand.",2
"September 28, 2021",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I tried lamotrigine twice. Unfortunately it caused very swollen lymph nodes with fever. I took Keppra 750mg twice a day for a few months. My kidneys couldn't handle it. I then stopped and tried again, ended up taking 500mg twice a day. I believe Keppra does stop seizures to some extent, although it causes side effects that are unbearable over time. The biggest issues were personality changes, I became a different human, lacked empathy, very moody and hardly happy. I did have bouts of aggression but for me, it was better than my previous aggressive issues before starting Keppra. Couldn't complete tasks, memory problems, libido problems, insomnia, lots of trouble focusing, I had no motivation & lots of sadness, my muscles ached, I couldn't train at the gym as much as I did before. I felt like I wasn't living my own life. I felt the cost of controlling seizures are just too high. It will work if you can live like a zombie.",5
"February 12, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,I had no option but to have the Keppra dose reduced from 300mg to nothing over a period of two years as I suffered far too many side effects including bright red blood in my stools. There were many other side effects too.,1
"September 18, 2021",Taken for 10 years or more,For Epilepsy:,"Keppra has worked so far for the last 14 years. When compared to the other 
1 AED (lamictal) that I've been on, its the better choice. But, if you are on it or about to start taking it, make sure to look at other options. Whether your male or female Keppra will negatively affect your sex life and will seriously impact your ability to reproduce. I wasn't aware of this side effect until recently but it has affected me since I started. As a result I'm now infertile. Also in todays society if sexual relations in a relationship are on the rocks, a relationship will most likely end in at least 1 partner cheating. Also avoid lamictal as the FDA has a warning on the side-effects (kidney disease). It also causes cognitive impairment ie symptoms resemble those of dementia. Every 4 years I have to decrease the lamictal dose by 100mg due to the side-effects. Klonazepam as well as any anti-depression AED also can cause infertility.",5

I have had 3 EEG's & 1 MRI, I still have seizure activity & medical professionals I have discussed my side effects I had with levetiracetam state I may never get back to my normal self.

First month was a bit rough as I felt disoriented and fatigued. Had a bit of a hiccup when my NOT so usual doctor switched me to immediate release generic. That was terrible!  Suicide ideation, anger, and hostility. Life was really awful within 24 hours on that crap!  Even got in trouble with the law by day two!  Knowing that wasn’t me, I went back to my regular and much loved doctor. Although not covered under my HMO, I needed my doctor and Keppra XR Brand.

I did not like myself anymore.  I talked to my GP and she put me on Citalopram Hydrobromide, 20 mg once a day.  She felt it was anxiety and would take 4-6 weeks to help.  Within two days I was back to my old self.  I have continued to take both ever since and have had no side effects from either.  I told my new neurologist about this.  He was interested.",10

Never had any good control on any other medications in the past , but when I would suddenly get feelings of anger I begin to see that keppra was speeding up my thinking and made me realize I now had more time to think . Aura's started about 3 month's ago, see if the DR wants to up my dose , age may be due to this . amazing drug though works well .",10

So I assume it worked well and I didn't suffer any physical side effects as my doctor kept monitoring the drug level through blood tests until she found the right amount.

HOWEVER, this drug literally made me a very horrible person, a bad guy, someone that I remember and I feel disgusted by, I feel embarrassed. I ruined some relationships and career opportunities. I was put into SSRIs and they didn't help but made things worse. I was in a rage all the time, I call it Kepprage

After another violent seizure, I was prescribed Lamictal which counterbalanced Keppra's psychological side effect",5
"September 24, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"My daughter all of a sudden had a seizure one day while out with a friend.  ER did a bunch of tests,  saw nothing,  sent her home. Every day for a week after that,  she wouldn't have the seizures where you buck and shake,  but instead they would make her stare off almost like she was blind and speak jibberish. After day 7, I took her to ER, different hospital.  They kept her for 5 days doing test after test.  MRI,EEG, CT SCAN,  even a Lumbar puncture.  Nothing,  no answer.  Even the dr saw what was happening because she had an episode while at hospital.  She couldn't stop spitting up as well. I don't say vomit cause it was not food. They discharged her with a prescription of Keppra, 3 pills 2x a day.  I forget the mg, but seemed really high when they couldn't even give us a direct diagnosis.  (She is 19). About day 2 on Keppra ER, she was a completely different person.  She started talking so fast, calling people every hour speaking about unrealistic things,  she would always want to GO ,",1
"August 24, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was put on Keppra and at first thought they were amazing as my grand mal seizures had just stopped! It’s not what they do for epilepsy that should be debated with this medication it’s what they do to your mind, I was sooooo depressed but had never been depressed before so I just let it go on and on until one night I tried to take my own life, funnily enough with Keppra! If I was rating this medication on solely stopping seizures it would get a 10 but I think when they’re offering this out they should maybe balance it out with an anti depressant",1
"July 27, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"I was put on this medication after ONE seizure with no history or seizures of any kind. This medication is HORRIBLE!!! I plead with anyone who is taking this to ask for help and if you have a loved one on it, know that they need your help. It causes severe confusion, nose bleeds, aggression, bad dreams & irritability to name a few. My dr was adamant that I needed it but when I finally forgot to take it one day I had a moment of clarity & looked up it’s side affects. I was floored that I was ever put on it. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a med, especially one I didn’t need! I weaned myself off of it and worry about long term effects from taking it for so long. I implore everyone to find something else if you suffer from seizures & ask a loved one to help you if you are having any of these horrific side affects. God bless you & Good luck to you all! I give it a scale of 10 on effects for VERY negative side effects.",10
"July 27, 2021",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Was on the highest dose (1gram). Drowsy, sleeping way too much, eating one meal a day, irritated, lack of energy and what prescribed to me as a depressant. 
I'm currently on 500mg with a bit more energy but I'm being weaned off completely after 8 years of misery.
I genuinely can't wait until the day where I don't have to take any more keppra.
I would advise anyone who is going on to keppra/levetiracetam to ask questions to their neurologist or epileptic nurse before taking.",4
"October 18, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Keppra (levetiracetam) for Seizures:,"Keppra is the one and only seizure drug that at least keeps Grand mal at bay as of having surgery without any horrendous side effects. It also profoundly reduces my appetite which is great for me as someone with a naturally voracious one.
It doesn't control my simple focal seizures particularly well is the only negative.",9
"July 9, 2009",,For Seizures:,"My 22 month old daughter has been on it for 1 1/2 weeks. Is done to two seizures a day but she is clingy and irritable. Her P.T came and she screamed the whole time she was here, usually she works well with her.",5
"November 19, 2021",,For Seizures:,"This medication is used for my almost 17 year old son who was diagnosed with JME at 12. He had 3 tonic clinic seizures. Zero seizures for 3 years so neuro decided to attempt to wean him from meds. Two months after weaning at 15 yo, he had a relapse and was put back on 500mg twice a day. So far 1.5 years seizure free, he has his license. His younger brother experienced the same thing and has the same diagnosis. As for side effects, they both experienced the several weeks of severe mood swings. Physical activity helps a lot with that, we took lots of walks, played cards, drew, etc.. They both swim competitively and have full lives; play instruments, traveled to Europe (including jet lag) all seizure free with this med. We have been training them to be responsible with regular timers and discipline if they forget to take it. We are trying to set them up for success as adults.
