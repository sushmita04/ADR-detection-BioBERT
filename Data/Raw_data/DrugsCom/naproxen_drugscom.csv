"May 2, 2012",Taken for 10 years or more,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"When I have sciatica pain in my hip I quickly eat something (protein bar often works), take two Aleve, then lay down on the floor and put my legs up on a chair. Sometimes I put an ice pack on the area also, and I lay there for 10-20 minutes and the pain almost always subsides. Then I make sure to stretch a bit so the pain doesn't return when the Aleve wears off. Aleve works GREAT when I'm in pain, but don't forget how vital it is to stretch and exercise also. ",10
"May 30, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"Unbelievable!  After suffering everyday with sciatica nerve pain, losing sleep, falling into depression, I tried one pill, Aleve. Nothing else I tried worked.  Aleve did exactly what my body needed to get relief from pain and inflammation.  I didn't want a narcotic, no. I will continue to take Aleve for a week to be sure that all traces of sciatica and inflammation are completely gone.",10
"October 7, 2013",,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,Unbelievable searing pain down the right side of my right leg always first thing in the morning after getting out of bed. I quickly take two Aleve with a glass of milk and wait for the pain to subside which usually takes about forty five minutes. I am then fine for the rest of the day. I also do yoga exercises later in the day which helps.,10
"May 8, 2021",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Aleve (naproxen) for Period Pain:,I’ve always had horrible period pain which would ruin my day and sometimes I couldn’t eat because the pain was too much. Aleve has always been my go to drug ever since I started my period at age 14. Once I pop 2 pills within minutes the pain is gone and I feel so much better! Would recommend it to anyone!,10
"March 8, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Sciatica:,"26 years US army, then 10 years civilian working in middle east, active with kids camping travel. BUT upon retiring at 56 years young suddenly the sciatic nerve issue, pain, pain, pain and did I mention PAIN?? Doc started me on 1 pill a day of naproxen, and just like a bunch of the posts on here I was skeptical to the point of laughter................Guess what   after taking three days the pain subsided..... and after 6 months it was, and two year later still is, GONE...",8
"May 23, 2013",,"Aleve (naproxen) for Gout, Acute:","I suffer from gout in my feet periodically because I do not take preventative medicines. My last bout I tried Tylenol extra strength first and got no relief. I switched to Aleve gel caps and immediately felt the pain decrease. I am a believer and also an Aleveir, thanks a lot.",9
"June 12, 2010",,Aleve (naproxen) for Osteoarthritis:,"My hip and shoulder have hurt for years and I have always taken Bayer aspirin and I tried Aleve arthritis gelcap.  To my surprise the pain in my hip and shoulder went away for 8 hours.  The only thing I don't know is how long I could take the stuff, the bottle said do not take for longer than 10 days.  The warning label about it could cause stroke or heart attack did raise questions.",9
"May 15, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,I had a herniated disc some 20 years ago and have never forgotten how effective Naproxen was at alleviating my condition. The results were astounding. Walked into a doctors surgery bent over almost double with severe sciatica. Prescribed Naproxen and took it immediately. Within 60 minutes I was walking like normal! I normally don't make comments on these kinds of thing but if it works even in a small number of people like it did me I am happy to share my experience. Try it nothing to lose no side effects I was aware of.,10
"May 6, 2014",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"This was my last chance to get relief,  my dr had advised that if we couldn't get the nerve to relax,  surgery was the next option.  The medication helped,  the only thing I would only take this at bed time.  This medication is very strong and makes you very sleepy, but it really does work. I only had to use it for a short time.  I will not take any thing longer than a month and only when I have to.",10
"September 26, 2016",,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"Two days ago I was getting out of my car . I slipped on the gravel, twisting and slipping the lower discs in my back. For two days I haven't been able to move without excruciating pain . I have been crying for two days I've taken Advil, Tylenol, Motrin muscle relaxers. Just a few hours ago my friend cones over hands me two aleves and some warm water. Within 30minutes I'm not lying the pain is gone. Thank you aleve, i promise to pass the word of your greatness.",10
"September 16, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"I have been taking Ibuprofen for years but only helped a little 
I saw commercial for Aleve and thought I would try What a difference in my back pain and sciatica.
It even took down the inflammation in my hands",8
"May 20, 2014",,"Aleve (naproxen) for Gout, Acute:",I don't even go to the foot doctor to refill my gout medicine anymore. Those little green pills are effective but make me feel terrible. Aleve is a tremendously effective medicine for my big toe gout and I DON'T have any side effects from it.,
"August 7, 2016",,For Period Pain:,"Aleve is much more effective for me than Advil.  Like everyone else I've been dealing with extremely painful cramps my whole life.  I was taking Advil but would always end up throwing up and bent over in excruciating pain, switched to Aleve and at least now I can function during the first three critical days and not stuck in bed throwing up.  I still get bad cramps every now and then so it's not perfect but at least Aleve helps me get through it.  I usually take two in the morning; two at night. There should be a support group for woman that suffer from severe menstrual cycles. I feel like I'm the only one, but felt better after reading some of the other posts here; I'm not alone in my struggle.",7
"November 19, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"I took 2 pills (220mg each) in the morning and it may take 1-2 hour before the pain is completely gone.  I've sciatica on my right leg from lower back down to the bottom of my feet.  Tickling & numbness besides the pain each morning.  First thing I did was taking 2 pills immediately.  I also practice yoga regularly..., I'm so grateful to discover Aleve for sciatica!   Will take it as long as my sciatica is here...",10
"December 27, 2013",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Headache:,I was prescribed naproxen by my neurologist for menstrual migraines that left me debilitated every month with severe vomiting.  I now take 500mg each morning and night a few days before my period is due.  I started taking this preventative treatment of naproxen six months ago.  I still get headaches and occasional migraines but they are less severe and I have no vomiting.  Before taking Naproxen I was having at least three days off work each month.  I haven't had any time off since starting the tablets - really have improved my quality of life.,8
"June 9, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"For several years I took Bayer Back & Body for my chronic back/sciatica pain (2 tabs, 2x day). I found very little relief. I recently started taking Aleve Back & Muscle Pain..This is my third day using Aleve Back & Muscle Pain...What a difference in just 3 days!!! I take 1 tab in the morning and it last all day!! The pain/burning sensation in my back/leg has reduced sufficiently. Thank You Aleve!!!",10
"December 7, 2012",,For Period Pain:,"Since beginning my period at the age of 12, I have experienced tremendous pain. So much so that I'd miss school, work, events, etc. I'd be in bed writing in unbelievable pain for the first day or two...on the toilet bent over in pain and dropping clots...losing weight...having absolutely zero energy - it'd take me about a week to feel somewhat normal again after each period. I've tried everything - you name it, I've tried it.  Since my new gynecologist prescribed naproxen, it has been LIFE CHANGING. The first time I took it, the beginnings of pain were gone in 20 minutes! So, for the first time in 22 years, I had NO pain with my period. That's a LONG time to have pain! I can't believe no one gave this to me sooner! It's GREAT!",10
"August 29, 2009",,Aleve (naproxen) for Rheumatoid Arthritis:,I have been using Aleve for about 6 months.  This medicine helps relieve all my aches and pains.  I'm 68 and working in food industry.  Although I experience severe body and joint pains on a daily basis I take one Aleve on the days I work and can put in 4 to 6 hours pain free.  I have not suffered any side effects so far.  So far none of the other medicines I have tried have been as effective as Aleve.,10
"October 2, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"Male - 33years old. Excruciating pain in lower SI region of my back following an aggressive 30 mile bick ride and a few days of surfing. Woke up the next morning with shooting pain in low back which progressed to shooting pains running down my glutes and referred pain to the hip flexor region. For two weeks this was extremely painful and did not subside even w/ ice applications and finally chiropractic visits 5 total and lots of Advil. 

Per the suggestion of my wife I tried aleve (2 pills for first dose and 1 pill each dose after that. After 2 pills I noticed a HUGE difference and significantly reduced pain as well as better range of motion as inflammation had gone down. I highly recommend for anyone with back pain as it really helped me!",9
"November 18, 2009",,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"A surgeon recommended that I have a procedure to deal with the effects of several ruptured disks in my lower back.  I prefer to put off the surgery for as long as I can, and use Aleve on an almost daily basis.  It works just fine for me, and I only have an incident about every 1.5 years, and usually because I overdo the yard work. When it gets very bad, I supplement with an anti spasmodic drug for a few days.",9
"February 24, 2010",,"Aleve (naproxen) for Gout, Acute:",Really worked for me.  I had significant pain and inflamation of my big toe.  Symptoms were getting worse until I took Aleve.  Almost immediate (1/2 hr) relief from pain and within one day of use the pain was gone and by the 2nd day the swelling was reduced.,10
"April 26, 2014",,For Period Pain:,"So when I started getting my period at about 13 I had the WORST CRAMPS EVER. Like I'm talking over the toilet, in the shower, missing school, and stuff like that. Typically it was only the first, rarely the second, day Of my cycle I would stay home or come home in bed feeling like my insides were flipping inside out. So after a couple months of this my mom got worried and took me to the doctor who told me I should go get an ultrasound on my uterus to make sure that there wasn't extra blood flow, extra lining, or anything. This is mostly because I didn't have blood clots so she wanted to make sure there wasn't something that needed attention pronto. nothing came up in the ultrasound. So I got prescribed naproxen and it's a LIFE SAVER!!!!",10
"July 23, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,"I'm 31 years old and I'm in the military, I always had severe and heavy periods with really bad cramps. Before I went in the military and I had my periods, I used to just relax and take maybe 2 Advil and it would pass but now everyday I have to move and workout and endure the pain and its horrible. So when I told my friend about that she told me she was in the same situation and she gave me naproxen and it was a life saver. Now I barely feel any cramps and even my flow isn't heavy anymore! I can finally focus on my job. I am so happy this medicine works.",10
"November 11, 2012",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"I bent over and suddenly experienced severe pain.  With either a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle, I could barely make it to a nearby chair.  I took 2 Aleve and applied an ice pack for the entire afternoon.  Within 45 minutes I could slowly walk and I continued to take Aleve as recommended on the bottle.  The next day I resumed my life as usual and in 3 or 4 days I no longer needed Aleve.  Wow, better than a chiropractor.",10
"May 27, 2012",,For Sciatica:,"At first I took Ibuprofen but that does nothing for Sciatica.  I went to the doctor because I could not walk and our physician said that Ibuprofen doesn't work for this, Naproxen does.  So about 500 mg and wow, it's fantastic.  Take it with buttermilk, yogurt, or a yogurt drink to keep your stomach in good shape.",10
"March 3, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Back Pain:,"I've taken prescription 500mg Naproxen twice a day everyday for 4 years.  If I miss a few days my back begins to hurt.  On the 1-10 scale maybe 4.  If I go a week then it's a 7-8 and I can't straighten up or walk with pain.
If I take 500 mg twice a day I can go all day, work hard and do it everyday.
I fear where I would be without Naproxen.
A few stomach problems now and then but prilosec everyday takes care of that.",10
"December 29, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Osteoarthritis:,"These work really well for me, reading these reviews I see they are not working for everyone. If I wasn't taking naproxen I couldn't walk to be honest. I'm waiting to have my spine fused due to my illness. My symptoms are back ache (gone) blood flow loss to legs (gone) severe tingles in legs (gone) numbness in hands and feet (gone) severe sharp pains on most movements (gone). For me this drug is great and I don't have the side effects as others have described. Give them a try it could work for you also, I wish you luck.",10
"March 24, 2009",,Naprelan (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"I am currently taking Celebrex and Prednisone for my Sciatica, 12 days now and no relief. Desperate for pain relief I took 1 naproxen 500mg. Thank God I did.
 
The pill is a little hard to swallow, and it may make you a little nauseous but it will definitely ease the pain and will allow you to get some much needed sleep.",9
"July 25, 2013",,For Period Pain:,"First let me say how bad are the cramps for me, they are the worst, like nothing else. I just cannot function in those days, legs feel like heavy stones that can't be moved, feeling dizzy and I don't want say how bad the stomach cramps are. So I've been taking ibuprofen for last year, it helped 3/10, then I decided to try Midol, which gave me worse day of my life, I took it in an empty stomach and I didn't get rid of ANY pain, it got worse and I threw up like 10 times in that day. So I went to my doctor who gave me naproxen. I got my period 6 hours before and I took it immediately, the pain to away in 20-30 mins and I feel wonderful now, I don't even feel I'm on my period. Also I avoided caffeine in last 10-12 days, and exercised LOTS.",9
"August 6, 2014",,Anaprox-DS (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"Since high school I had terrible cramps/fatigue and nausea. I wasn't able to go about my normal activities. Until I switched doctors and she prescribed me the naproxen. I take it a few days before I get my period (when I get ""warning"" cramps). By the time my period comes I have no nausea and no fatigue, the cramps are still there but nowhere close to how bad I feel without the naproxen. I have to take this with food, because if I don't it messes with my stomach. Easy to take.",10
"September 8, 2013",,For Back Pain:,"Naproxen really helped my lower back. I have no pain after taking this medicine. Just remember, everyone's body is different and will respond to medication differently. Naproxen seems to working for a lot of people.",10
"November 27, 2015",,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,Female 20 years old - I recently started a new job as a cashier. I started to experience pain after having to pick up heavy packs of water bottles and other heavy items. The pain was all in my lower back. I went to visit my chiropractor and that would alleviate the pain until I went back to work. I would rate my pain on a scale from 1 to 10; a 7. It was a sharp stabbing pulling pain in my lower back and it even hurt to take a deep breath. Today was the first day I took Aleve when I went to work and my back pain was almost completely gone. I was able to move around without being uncomfortable. I am extremely satisfied with the results.,9
"February 18, 2020",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Osteoarthritis:,"I have been taking two 500 mg naproxen  tablets per day for several years due to osteoarthritis, back & knee pain. I had no side effects for a long time, but in the last 2 years I have had issues with the skin on the back of my hands. I am a farmer, so daily work with my hands around sharp objects (like Barbed wire) is a constant. I began to get cuts and small lesions on the back of my hands that were slow to heal and then left shallow red scarring.  I began researching my condition and came across ""Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced pseudoporphyria"". Symptoms of this condition exactly describes my condition. This is listed as ""a relatively rarely reported condition"", and therefore not commonly listed as a side effect of taking naproxen. I have discontinued naproxen and will be meeting with my Dr. to determine another anti-inflammatory for my condition. I hope this information helps so that someone who has this problem doesn't suffer for years with it like I have.",4
"December 22, 2014",,For Period Pain:,"I was prescribed 500mg a day for a shoulder injury, I am so used to dealing with terrible period pain and extremely heavy flow that it wasn't the reason I went to see a doctor. Not only does it help with my shoulder pain but my period has completely turned around into an experience I do not dread and worry about. I am so grateful to have been prescribed it. I don't have to put my life on hold to hide at home in pain and all around feeling terrible. When I started getting my period until I graduated high school I would always end up missing a day or two because of how much pain I was in and how heavy my flow was. When I worked I would dread the days with it and a lot of the time miss work because of it.",10
"November 2, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Sciatica:,Prescribed 500mg twice a day of naproxen along with codeine and oramorph for my first sciatic episode.  I stopped the oramorph after a couple of days as I hated the way it made me feel and the codeine lasted about 5 days. Now had 5 days of just the naproxen. The pain is unbearable in the morning and don't know if the pain goes to a manageable level because I start to move or because my morning dose has kicked in. I'm getting some weird side effects like numb fingers and bad stomach pains so I don't know if i should quit taking the drug to see if i still need it or not?,7
"May 6, 2013",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"Ibuprofen bothers my stomach so I tried Aleve/naproxen some years back and as to this day it works better then anything else, over the counter, that I have taken. It may not take away all the pain but it takes that evil edge off so the pain becomes less likely to make me vomit. I take Aleve in the morning to prevent the pains and again when I do get the pains. ",8
"November 22, 2011",,Aleve (naproxen) for Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"I started taking Aleve for my Arthritis in my hand and the pain was gone but after taking it for about 8 days I noticed swelling in my feet, which was abnormal for me. I am 34 and in good health and have never had swollen feet. I then noticed the next day my feet and hands were swollen. I finally put 2 and 2 together and realized I was allergic to the Aleve. I stopped taking it and haven't had swelling since.",4
"February 28, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,I started taking this medicine about 6 months ago.  I was recently hospitalized for blood in my stools.  It was found out that Naproxen was the cause. I will have to find another medicine to help with my rheumatoid arthritis. I was not aware of the side effects.  I believe that this information should be more and more publicized. ,5
"December 30, 2015",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"I had been suffering with sciatica for a number of years, when it suddenly worsened.  I started getting shooting pains and severe weakness in both of my legs.  After one dose of 500mg I was able to sit comfortably and walk without the worry of one of my legs giving out from under me",9
"August 12, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Back Pain:,"Absolutely amazing! I was suffering from severe back pain, and a pulsating sciatica from some kind of disc injury (no idea, didn't have MRI). The pain changed daily. On some days, I couldn't leave my bed, and on others, I could walk, but only for a short amount of time. I went to my family doctor, and she prescribed me some Naproxen 500MG tablets. I took the dosage, and the pain was gone in absolutely no time.

The dosage of 2 Naproxen Tablets will last me 2-3 days before the effects wore off. However, I still had difficulty walking for a moderate to long amount of time before the sciatica came back, and my lower back felt weak. No side effects either, so that's a plus.",9
"August 5, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Sciatica:,Have had Naproxen before and it was useless for sciatica pain. Used diclofenac and it was great but now I am 64 doctor won't prescribe it and has given me Naproxen and said to take paracetamol - I am now on my 2nd week of agony and can't stand up straight or walk far.,1
"November 3, 2009",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"I've had RA for 4 years.  500mg naproxen tablets were my first treatment.  They definitely helped the day get better and be able to function daily.  However, they did not stop the morning stiffness and pain or the build up of inflamation in my body.  I definitely needed a more serious drug to stop the progression of the disease.",5
"April 22, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Headache:,Suffer from severe headache and usually no medicine works- but by chance on holiday I had one of these that belongs to my mum and I couldn't believe how quickly it disappeared as soon as I feel a migraine coming on I take naproxen now and it goes quickly,10
"January 8, 2014",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,My experienced was my period was non-stop for almost 2 month. I went to my gyn and prescribed me Naproxen for pain. It was so effective that my period went away in a week. Now when my period comes I'll take it right away. Thanks Naproxen.,9
"December 10, 2014",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Back Pain:,I've been using this medicine on & off for 25 years. I get muscle spasms every few years & virtually drop to the floor with pain. 2 to 3 days with this stuff & I'm back swinging again. Better than Forte or Voltaren by a long shot.,10
"September 20, 2014",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Osteoarthritis:,"I am 51 yrs old with advanced Osteoarthritis in both hips, and on the surgery wait list to have THR.  Naproxen is quite amazing for me at controlling OA pain.  So far I only take it when I have upcoming situations where I will need to walk alot.  For these situations I'll take Naproxen 1-2 days in advance, 2 x 500mg tablet daily.  It makes a huge difference.  If I didn't worry about stomach or intestine damage I would take it continually.  Other days, I try to get by with low doses of ibuprofen.",8
"April 23, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,I have been taking norco 5mg a day for a bad lower back pain and of course this really did remove all pain. But many countries don't have this drug so my pharmacy said to try Aleve. I was so surprised that I still can't believe that it took 95% of my pain away. I travel with Aleve and won't have problems in bringing drugs into other countries.,10
"August 29, 2015",,Aleve (naproxen) for Headache:,"Wow has this changed my life. I was a long time sufferer of migraines and headaches. Advil and tynelols are like candy to me now and don't do a thing to relief pain. Even heavy prescribed migraine drugs by my doctor did not work as much as Aleve does! It is simply, for my part, miraculous! It works 99.9% of the time. It works to prevent a headache when I feel it coming. It also works to break the headache or migraine when it is already ongoing and painful. And most of the time, a single pill works. I have to say I really hope my body doesn't come used to Aleve and therefore making it less effective. So far, after a little more than a year taking Aleve, it still is perfectly effective in my case. Don't hesitate to try!",10
"January 20, 2015",,For Period Pain:,"My period has been awful since the first time I got it at age 13. I've experienced a variety of symptoms each month that make my period unpredictable. Some months I feel fine and maybe just get a pimple, other months I'm a crying mess, there have been times where the pressure on my lower back and abdomen is so intense that I cant move, nausea, headaches, joint pain in my knees, etc. It got to the point where when I was 15 I started birth control. The birth control made me extremely emotional so I stopped and continued with Advil, Midol, I tried bananas, warm compresses, exercise. Nothing worked. I started using naproxen and within 10-15 min my symptoms are alleviated and I can go about my day.",10
"August 4, 2020",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Period Pain:,"When I take naproxen for period cramps, it takes around an hour for it to kick in. My doctor recommended I take it every 12 hours (twice a day dose) but the pain comes back in less than 8. I do not think it would be safe to take it 3 times a day, so I suffer in pain for a few extra hours until it is time for my next dose. My cramps hurt the most in the middle of the night because the medicine wears off and I am sometimes woken up out of my sleep because of it.",4
"November 2, 2014",,"For Gout, Acute:","Have been suffering from acute gout attacks for about 6 years.  Usually 1 attack per year that requires me to stay off my feet for a day or 2.  I have taken Indomethacin,  Colchicine and Colcrys with varying degrees of relief and started Allopurinol about 3 months ago.  In all my research over the years, I never reviewed Naproxen.  The last attack happened about a week ago and I cycled through my last few Colcrys with barely any relief.  A trip to Walgreens for Aleve liquigels and about 2 hours later I had ~70% reduction in pain.  I've been managing it with a scheduled dose for a few days now and the pain is nearly gone.  Still some swelling, but getting better each day.  This regimen has been more effective than any prescription medication.",9
"December 29, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"I have been suffering from back pain for many years, mainly due to heavy contact sports and work related lifting, and lately find it difficult to walk for long distances without being doubled over in pain. I would struggle to stand up from a sitting position. The pain would go down my legs and into my abdominal region, and have been trying all different kinds of treatment from gels to moderate pain killers all with different degrees of success, but none that actually took the pain away completely, and not for any length of time. I was eventually prescribed Naproxen and in less than a day I felt a different person. The pain has gone completely from everywhere. It's a new lease of life and can look forward to doing things again pain free.",10
"August 19, 2012",,For Period Pain:,"After 2 decades of seeking relief from bad menstrual cramps and who knows how many gynos (who either accused me of drug seeking or threw narcotics at me, then branded me noncompliant for refusing narcotics) I found a doctor who gave me naproxen. He explained something about its blood thinning properties and how it thins the blood before it sheds from the uterus, as where blot clots the uterus when the shed. MADE SO MUCH SENSE! Especially after the wonderful results. Flow is extremely heavier for the 1st 2 days, then barely a streak for the next 5 days, but NO pain, not even a pinch! Miracle! Taken 3 days before also completely eliminates sore breasts and bloating. If I didn't bleed I wouldn't even know I was having a period. No joke.",10
"February 2, 2021",,For Pain:,"I’ve been using naproxen tablets for three months until one night I was sick, my vomit had red blood in it and blood that was real black colour and I had stomach cramps. I saw my doctor and he said I have had a bleed in the stomach to come off of the tablet straight away. The naproxen tablets had caused a bleed. I am now on another lot of tablets to repair my stomach. Stay away from these tablets, do not use.",2
"April 15, 2016",,For Headache:,Third month on naproxen and can't believe how much it has changed my life.  I use to suffer with migraines and tension headaches a week before my period lasting throughout my period leaving me in incruciating pain since taking naproxen my headache pain has reduced by 80%,9
"August 17, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Pain:,"Suffered for 4 months with painful knee causing me to limp badly. Was prescribed naproxen twice daily whilst awaiting scan. 
Day 1 eased pain slightly
Day 2 eased pain dramatically 
Day 3 pain gone.

"June 13, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"I had real lower back muscle pain for two weeks. Dr gave me Cyclbenzaprine-- not good. Saw an Aleve commercial on TV, it was a back pain reliever. Within 15 minutes of taking it sharp pain was reduced dramatically. That's all I can tell you. I still am on it and have no bad comments.",9
"August 9, 2016",,For Headache:,"I'm 40 and have been a long life sufferer of migraines especially 3/4 days before my period. My migraines would last 4/5 days with the first day not able to function at all. I will be looking for a cool, dark and quite room to lay my body in and not to speak.. Since I was prescribed Naproxen 250 mg, I started taking 2 just as I start feeling a tingle of it coming. It doesn't stop it all together, but it eases it. It made my life a lot better. I get a lot less episodes of migraine that don't last long. I also made a change in my life style. I make sure I avoid stress when I can, I do take at least a day when I don't do anything but chill, not even housework. My diet has always been very healthy and balanced so I know it's not it's not that.",9
"October 8, 2018",,Aleve (naproxen) for Osteoarthritis:,"2013/14 took 2 Aleve every a.m. for knees. I found myself feeling weak - like going to pass out. Went to primary next day.  Checked blood count and did the rectal blood. Told my SO to get me to emergency now.   Blood count 7 and needed transfusion. Had endoscopy.  Released after 3 days -blood normal. Told to see gastro upon my release. Over the next week had colonoscopy, intestinal exam, and lastly capsule endoscopy - swallow a small capsule camera to film 8 hours going through my body.  Dr and I reviewed the results. Three places in intestines indicated bleeding - I could see them.  He asked me food or meds I was taking - Aleve had caused the bleeding as it is a  NSAID. I can't take any NSAID and nothing with aspirin in it or I may bleed.  So now I basically live w/o taking anything for pain.  ALEVE - Read the package - very small print - may cause BLEEDING.",1
"December 29, 2011",,"For Gout, Acute:",Aleve works better than anything I've tried. Like other users have stated take 3-4 initially ever 8 hours then reduce to 1-2 ever 8 hours until gout attack is completely gone.  It took 1 day to reduce a full-on gout attack to a state where it is barely noticeable.  ,10
"March 16, 2014",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Pain:,"I had ongoing pain and swelling for a full year after knee surgery to repair three rips in my right knee. It felt like bone rubbing on bone, felt hot to the touch with swelling  After going through narcotics and Motrin for swelling, I worked on accepting that I would be dealing with this for a long time as a chronic condition.  After my 1st dose of 500 mg of Naprosyn, it was a Godsend. For the 1st time in a year, my knee actually felt normal.",10
"August 12, 2011",,Aleve (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"This medicine saved me.  Starting about the age of 15 I began to experience menstrual cramps for the first time.   It was the very worst pain I had ever felt at that time.  Not content to only hurt in my lower abdomen the pain radiated all the way down the front of my legs to my ankles.  I couldn't sit still.  All I could do was pace back and forth crying.  I couldn't find a single pain reliever that worked; we had the usual in the house, aspirin, ibuprofen, even Midol.  Finally my mother became so worried she took me to the doctor.  I thought I was going to have to be on some kind of strong prescription medication.  What does he do, he returns to the room with about 50 samples of Aleve and it has been my miracle drug ever since.",10
"June 1, 2013",,For Sciatica:,"I have had very big problems. Been taking Norco and muscle relaxers. I stopped taking the Norcos..didn't help!

"November 1, 2015",,For Headache:,"I have been using this drug for 2 years now. Every time I feel like I am starting a migraine, I take one pill and it kills it in no time.

"April 5, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Tendonitis:,THIS DRUG HAS RUINED MY LIFE. In fact I might be dying from The adverse effect it had on me  I took it for tendonitis in my wrist. It reduced the pain but gave me a VERY SEVERE ADVERSE EFFECT. For the past 7 months my head is constant pain. I have numbness / tingling in my head. Also both of my hands developed numbness and pins and needles sensation as well. I have been to 3 neurologists and I'm trying to figure out how to undo these crippling effects that Naproxen has had on me. I can't exercise or basically do anything because it hurts my head. It feels like my head is constantly being squeezed. I also experience dizziness and vertigo if I try to be active. Be very careful if you take this drug. It has destroyed my life. Try any other anti inflammatory  medication before this one. If you are on a benzo be very careful taking this medication. NAPROXEN HAS DESTROYED MY LIFE.,1

"October 29, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"Would only recommend taking  naproxen if you’re in extreme pain. It works for that very well. But I had a horrific experience with the side effects of Naproxen (OTC). An hour after taking it I felt stranger than I have in my entire life: dizzy, sweating PROFUSELY, lightheaded and sort of as if the room was spinning, felt the need to run to bathroom but nothing happened. Spent that night feeling chilled and bizarre with a pounding heart and SEVERE anxiety. Exactly a week later and I still feel very anxious and lightheaded at times. It took several days for most of the side effects to go away. Can still feel it seven days later. Worked well for my mom’s shoulder pain but gave her strange side effects too.",
"July 1, 2015",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Bursitis:,I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg for my bursitis behind my knees in both legs. I am a college athlete and was having many problems performing at the necessary level with the pain in my legs--Naproxen helped immensely. Felt very nauseous if I did not take this medication on a full stomach!,7
"September 19, 2009",,For Bursitis:,"I've had frequent steroidal shots in my shoulder for bursitis, but my doctor recommended trying naproxen sodium instead this visit.  I am very pleased with the pain relief, as long as I remember to take it!",9
"February 29, 2020",,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,I've worked hard all my life. I've had disk problems in my back for 4 years now. My doctors given me this and that...but nothing really worked. I've been using Aleve now and it really takes the edge off!!!,10
"October 1, 2019",,For Back Pain:,"Told my doctor Naproxen does not work for me.  He said yes it will.......pain before was 7-8 out of 10 now after taking it pain still 7-8 out of 10.  I have been up for heading towards 48 hours without sleep due to excessive pain and discomfort.  Disappointment cannot begin to describe.....
This medication was useless the past two time it was prescribed to me and here I am again with a useless prescription and no pain relief. I may need to find a doctor that listens to their patients.",1
"August 26, 2018",,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"I have had rheumatoid arthritis for over 25 years. I have always found that if I take only 200 mg naproxen or ibuprofen with water and some food an hour before going to bed, I have very little morning stiffness in my hands or feet. It makes a world of difference to me taking it before bed time.",9
"November 15, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,"I have been suffering with period pain and heavy bleeding for 3 years (since the birth of my last baby).  I read a study on using Naproxen at the onset of your period for 5 days to help with pain and bleeding, so I decided it was worth a try.  I took 500 mg twice a day. The results are nothing less than amazing!  No clots, no need to stay at home and near a bathroom, no sleeping with towels under me at night, no pain and stress.  I feel like a normal human being!",10
"October 30, 2011",,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"Two Aleve a day helped my back pain, but over time it affected my stomach. My gastroenterologist knew immediately what my problem was and I've stopped Aleve entirely. I had almost a year of constant nausea and pain until I quit taking Aleve.",2
"March 30, 2016",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Back Pain:,"I have been suffering acute pain (on scale 1-10 stays between 7-10)  due to a fibrolipoma in my lower lumbar. Seems likely I have something called Tethered Cord Syndrome. Was put on naproxen by one doctor and after taking it for a few years was sick of the way it made me feel so I stopped taking it. Noticed that when not taking it I felt just as much pain as when I was taking it, so it was not helping AT ALL. Everyone needs to know that naproxen only works for pain caused by inflammation, it will do nothing for nerve damage, in my experience.",1
"December 13, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Headache:,"I have recently started using naproxen (prescription) for my migraines. I generally get migraines during my menstrual cycle and the doctor recommended taking naproxen (500 mg) every 12 hrs of that special week and so far it seems to be working. On other random days if I feel the slightest hinkling of a migraine coming on I take one naproxen and it seems to keep the migraine at bay. Naproxen has helped me have more control over my migraines, the odd time I still have to take a migraine pill such as Zomig.",9
"November 18, 2014",,For Period Pain:,I have extreme nausea a few days before and during my period. I tried so many things but nothing worked. My gyn wrote me a script for 550 mg of naproxen twice daily and I took it 3 days before my period and during my period. It worked!! I feel 100% better than the previous month.,10
"January 19, 2011",,For Sciatica:,"I recently acquired sciatica and it is painful at times. Usually at the end of the day after walking. I started a new job that has stairs everywhere (along with elevators) Using the stairs everyday seems to have helped it (hanging on to the rails). But, the Naproxen twice a day is helping me to use the stairs. Naproxen once a day wasn't cutting it. Just one floor at a time, then the elevator. 

I'm convinced that the inflammation is the culprit as it causes tendons to become sticky and grind tendons against muscles when moving causing pain incrementally as the day progresses. I had a motorcycle accident and landed hard on my toosh.",9
"April 20, 2019",,For Back Pain:,"Been taking Naproxen for 4 years, always helps me with my herniated disc when it bulges.I have a history of taking codeine, vicodins, tamadol and etc all those pills do is take away your senses of pain that goes to your brain instead of actually healing it. I have a broken leg with 30 screws and my shoulder too, take my advice in what helps - naproxen takes time but will heal whatever you have plus it's a non narcotic will pass any drug test.

I have done every natural therapy known to me including myotherapy, acupuncture, deep tissue massage, Bowen therapy, chiropractic and osteopathy therapy, etc.

The therapy alone was costing me $800 a month plus pain killing medications. I started to believe I was addicted to codeine because I associated it with withdrawal like symptoms. 

I then went back to my GP and was told to have X-rays including an MRI after seeing a rheumatologist specialist. 

Diagnosed with cervical osteoarthritis and also osteoarthritis in my hip. Last winter I couldn't even put on my undies.

I bought some because people, including doctors, constantly tell me how good it is for all kinds of pain.  It does NOTHING for me.  I've used it for headaches, neck pain, joint pain - zero pain relief.  Two Advil are way, way more effective.  I feel like I've wasted money on a completely useless drug. Won't ever buy it again.",2
"February 14, 2013",,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Tendonitis:,"Fell onto my shoulder off my sons skate board, initially felt no discomfort, but my shoulder a week or so after began to become painful, enough to stop me swimming. Waited 3 months for it to go, no reduction on pain, went to doctor who prescribed Naprosyn within a day or two pain had eased, carried on for 2 weeks and now swim regularly, very slight discomfort but take remaining pills as and when needed, but discomfort so small rarely have to take them. 
Negatives, I think when taking medication I suffered stomach discomfort.",7
"January 6, 2021",,Aleve (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"This has to be the most unproductive company on the face of this planet, this product does absolutely nothing for you other than give you false hope. I can’t for the life of me understand how they are even allowed to put back relief on the front of their bottle.

My hands and fingers become so stiff to the point of little use of them. I explained this to my doctor and her response was to give me another medication. This time for arthritis.

I was discharged from A&E that afternoon and after that things got steadily worse. I ended up with serious heart palpitations, tinnitus and confusion. Have had the all clear regarding blocked arteries, no problem there. The doctors that dealt with me refuse to accept that naproxen might have been responsible, I'm now a regular attendee at the Royal London hospital, the heart failure clinic.

"July 25, 2015",,Aleve (naproxen) for Headache:,"My head and base of the neck started hurting three days ago.  The pain also moved from place to place and so abnormal that I scheduled a doctor's appointment...for next week. This pain even made my ""hair"" hurt.  Felt like spots in the central back part of my head had been ""bruised"" and again, the pain location changed from the back center of head to my upper neck to the back of ears and then to the top.  Prescription pain medicine left over from a surgery didn't help.  Last night I took 3 Aleve out of desperation.  Fell asleep and woke up a few hours later feeling much, much better.

Woke up at 4am, I can actually walk to the bathroom without crutches... it apparently took about 50% of the pain away. Still painful, still hobbling around, but I can walk unassisted! No crutches!

Only thing is, once it wears off (about 4-6 hours), the pain returns big time, and you're not supposed to use more than 2 tablets a day. Also, it made me ravenously hungry at the start (not so much now) so I've added a couple of Kg in weight. When it doesn't work well I take some Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) as well. Doesn't do anything for my headaches though and may even cause them.",7

After I turned 13, my doctor decided to prescribe me naproxen, 250 mg, take 2 at onset of cramps and then 1 pill every 6-8 hours as needed. It was magical, I mean within 10-20 minutes of me taking it, the pain went away. How? Naproxen is a NSAID, it reduces inflammation in the uterus. That simple.

My doctor recommended Aleve so I take 2 caplets (440mg) and there is a bit less pain for a few hours. The package says it works for 8-12 hours, but I'm lucky if it stretches out to 5. Takes my pain from a 7 (out of 10) to a 3 or 4. And then I can't drink for another 8 hours which is no fun.",4

Took them for 5 days 200mg twice a day.  My side effects were pain in kidney, stomach back, constipated. Trouble passing urine very sore.  I just hope they haven't messed my insides up.  I would say. Stay away from these. Oh and he tried to give me Gabapentin today checked side affects. No way I’m taking them. So pain for two weeks then physio. Better than option from doc",1

I started off having tablets from friends who suffer from gout and tried a few different types that they had been prescribed and always kept on stand-by! The best one I've found (and I've suffered for several years now) was Naproxen. My friends would give me a few pills and they would relieve it every time. Some other NSAIDs did not work at all.
After doing a bit of research I discovered that Naproxen is a prescription drug. However, it is contained in Feminax Ultra which is sold over the counter for period pain only. I always keep a pack near me and take 4 pills as soon as I feel it starting. Works every time.",10
"January 9, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,Doctor prescribed me naproxen sodium since I have endometriosis and it helps my cramps a lot.  My cramps before were so bad they made me stay in bed and made me nauseous. This stops/slows the cramps thus eliminating all my other period pains. Definitely recommend this to other women with the same problem.,9

At the very least this will take the sharp edge off and give you enough time to get to Urgent Care or an immediate doctor appointment. I have noticed that for extended use (2-5 days) the pain symptoms slowly come back, but at least this is something I can buy OTC.",4
"December 1, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Headache:,"I was suffering from the common cold and had symptoms of dry cough, congested sinus, large headache, slight ear pain, sore throat, and muscle pain in my knees and gleutus maximus. I couldn't eat anything either and at times felt like vomiting. Also, I would wake up in the middle of sleeping, mumbling from my symptoms and pain. And, I would sleep long hours, and no sleep is enough for me. Taking naproxen 220 mg and sleeping that night, I felt 10 times better. The headache was gone, and so was the muscle pain. I slept good that night. I feel like I could do the usual tasks (including eating) now.",9

All day Wednesday back pain was just as bad and cramps too. The cramps stopped about 8pm Wednesday night and my stomach hasn't been right since just wondering if anyone else has as same thing happen to them.,
"April 12, 2017",,For Neck Pain:,"Having constant painful neck pain on both sides of my neck. 
Naproxen will help with most of the pain(tolerable-somewhat) 
But those pesky NSAIDS and their stoke/heart attack possibilities. 
If not for that little concern they would be a favorite for life. 
But seriously the naproxen really can help you for some neck pain relief. Just not to safe to use more than 10 days. I just wish my neck pain was just a ten day issue? Chronic neck pain can drain you of your life if you let it. 
But like others I wish to help people if I can with my experience with naproxen and just let people know they are not alone with their neck issues.
Good luck to all! We are going to need it.",8

"August 14, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,Naproxen was the only medication that has worked with the excruciating right leg pain due to a herniated disk. The pain would keep me up all night crying. I am now into week 4 of physical therapy I can now do all of the stretches. The only side effect I have is it did cause some stomach issues but it was worth it to not have the nerve pain. Finally seeing recovery in my future.,10
"August 2, 2014",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Back Pain:,"My back pain started right after the kidney infection and tried X-ray, ultrasound, and therapy (still going for therapy), and physical massages. I avoided any medicine until I felt feverish one day and took one Advil pill. As I was sitting down comfortably and had to get up to make dinner, I noticed drastic change that I was in lesser pain, but still in pain. I was able to move better than I have been in two months. The physical therapy was helping, but it was a slow progress due to my work environment that requires me to lift heavy things. The massages were a bit helpful, but I wanted it everyday sort of a thing to get a relief. I ended up taking 2 Advils, but it wasn't enough for me. I told the doctor and she gave me this! No more pain!",10
"January 14, 2020",,For Period Pain:,Amazing amazing amazing! They are like magic pills. I have to take mine 2 or 3 days before my period and they take my pain away.

I have unbearable cramps to where I'm stuck in bed and cry all day from the pain. I've tried everything over the counter and nothing has worked. I was prescribed the 550 mg and my life has changed. Even though there are times where I still have pain it's not as bad as it was. I don't experience any real side effects except sometimes I get a little tired, but it's not horrible.",8

With this condition, pain is an everyday thing, especially back pain because I have scoliosis (a curve of the spine; side effect of NF1). In the past I would take 3 Ibuprofen, which had very little effect. Just yesterday I switched to Aleve; those first two pills really made a difference. My pain went away about an hour later and it worked a lot faster than the other medicines I've taken.

Thank you, Aleve!",
"January 1, 2017",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Period Pain:,"I have always had severe period cramps, fainting, nausea, and stabbing pains. Naproxen 500 has been the only (non birth control remedy) that greatly relieves my pain. It's tricky because you have to get the timing just right, not too soon before period cramps start or too late after they already started. You must start it the moment you feel cramps. Starting before your period isn't as effective because that's not how this medication works best.",9

After examining me and taking X-rays he prescribed the Naprelan 500mg time release for me. He also went as far as to warn me that even though I would feel better it was not healed and I needed to take it easy. I am so glad he did because after 2 days I felt almost back to normal even though the back condition was such that I am be referred to physical therapy for it. Long story short, this medicine works, just be careful.",9
"May 12, 2008",,For Muscle Pain:,"I used Naproxen when I tore a tendon in my knee and the swelling would not go down. Naproxen works. It takes some time but you have to be on a regular dose and once you stop taking it, it goes back to the way it was before (at least in my case it did).",8

I still have 7 of those left from 2017, thank goodness.  Even though they've turned yellow over the years, I still take one about once a month when the pain is bad. I asked my doctor about this and she said Oxycodone doesn't go bad, so to take when needed.  She also said they couldn't prescribe Oxycodone any longer because of because people abuse them.  Well, I don't have not abused them, but because of others, not just me but others have to suffer?  Somethings not right here.  She did prescribe 500mg of Naproxen.  Good grief, why even bother taking it?  Absolutely zero relief.",1

I took one yesterday and one today and its eased quite a bit. My worse time is when I get up am hobbling around on one leg until nerve settles. still get the pins needles in foot and leg, but the naproxin seems to ease the actual pain and relax the nerves. It does not make the pain go but just relaxes it. It works for some and not for others but guess same with all medicines.

I am currently traveling through the Dominican Republic and woke up with a sore toe.  Not nearly as painful as the first attack.

Not everyone can take this and you should ask your doctor before taking it.  I was an emergency room nurse for 20 years and I never had a patient with an allergic reaction to this type of medication but it can happen.  The most common side effect is stomach problems so don't take it on an empty stomach.,10
"August 30, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Sciatica:,Sciatica pain was severe and switched from ibuprofen Advil to naproxen Aleve and found absolutely no difference whatsoever. Excruciating pain never subsided and barely took the edge off. Am now trying AC&C which has always worked as a pain killer for me probably due to the mix if Aspirin Caffeine and Codeine. I have read that sciatica does not necessarily need an anti inflammatory. At least I slept 5 hours straight on AC&C,1
"June 18, 2015",,Flanax Pain Reliever (naproxen) for Costochondritis:,I have had costochondritis for two months now. I have found that my body best responds to naproxen and toradol/ ketorolac. These have both been prescribed to me after my success with Flanax (Naproxen).,10
"July 18, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"I was given Naproxen by my doctor for lower back pain and it really worked well. The pain reduced a lot and I could sleep better. The only problem is that it make my stomach feel uneasy and a little sick at times. It also gave me gas and changed my stool. 

I’d only ever take it again if pain is unbearable, otherwise I’d rather go through the pain until it gets better rather.

However, very effective at reducing the back pain to almost no pain and that’s why I rated it 8.",8
"November 8, 2013",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,This pill is a super strength Rx form of Aleve. If you have chronic pain it's good for inflammation of the joints that narcotic meds just cover up. Take them for breakthrough pain prn with food. They can be hard on your tummy like Tylenol type meds. I've lived with severe pain since 1989. In 2003 I was crushed between my back bumper of my car after running outta gas and the front grill of a Blazer SUV. My left leg was degloved. After a long hospital stay and many surgeries they saved my leg by reconstruction. I finally found a pain management Dr after jumping thru lots of hoops. I always fear loosing my meds before. I get where I no longer needs. them one day ( I hope). Good luck to those that aren't so fortunate as to find a compassionate Dr.,5
"January 18, 2019",Taken for 10 years or more,"For Gout, Acute:","Hi i'm 30 years old, I have had gout flare ups since I was a little kid some severe enough to cause surgery to have to be performed. I get flare ups in both feet from my toes all the way to my ankles. In some cases it has happened in my lower spine, I have taken almost anything under the sun to try and alleviate the pain, pills, teas and patches. Maybe my body chemistry is different than most but indomethacin is the best possible thing I've found for when the pain is unbearable. Yes there are some side effects, but we can all agree we wouldn't be here if we didn't know the piercing, debilitating pain of gout and when it's that bad a few little side effects don't bother me when it attacks the pain like it does, good luck with it.",
"December 8, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,"For Gout, Acute:",After 2 and a half months of consistent gout flare ups. Indomethicin gave relief with lots of side effects. Weeks of Ibuprofen with no results. Switched to Naproxen and pain subsided immediately. All swelling gone the following day. No side effects like the Indomethicin. Feet are smaller than they have been in a long time. Even my work boots are loose now.,10
"December 8, 2009",,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,I have not had any side effects that I know of and I have been on this for about 2 years. It help's keep the pain away for a while and when it is bad it takes the sharp edge off the pain but I also use a hot water bottle for ease and comfort when it is bad.,8
"December 8, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Sciatica:,"Aleve heavily advertised for 12 hour pain relief.  Also recommended by a friend.  Tried as desperate for all day pain relief from sciatic nerve.  No effect whatsoever, persevered for a week, no relief, even with recommended stretching.",1
"January 5, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"I took Naproxen for a week without taking Omeprazole.  The doctor had said I should only take the Omeprazole if needed. By the time I needed it , the damage had been done.  I had chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) caused by the Naproxen. You must take both at the same time. I was in agony.",4
"June 20, 2011",,Anaprox (naproxen) for Muscle Pain:,"I am a 47 year old female with a knee injury. The doctor gave me Anaprox 550 mg twice a day and I was not able to take it. I started taking it and on the third day, I started getting sick to my stomach, lost appetite and was dizzy. I cut down to 275mg twice a day and I still felt quizzy. This is too strong for me.",
"May 14, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Period Pain:,"I'm a person where my period usually lasts around 8-10 days & is very heavy and crampy. On average I use about 6 pads a day. My period is  also super crampy where my school & my job is used to me missing almost a week. But a little over a year ago a friend of mine had a prescription for naproxen, she let me try it out to see how I liked it since nothing worked for me. I've tried advil, aleve, ibuprofen, tylenol & midol but nothing seemed to work. But let me tell you when I tried naproxen , it was a miracle!!!! it takes under 10 minutes to work for me and it has a long lasting effect. I usually take one pill a day, hardly ever two and it keeps me cramp free the entire day & thats a lot to say considering I used to miss work and school !!",10
"June 27, 2008",,For Muscle Pain:,I use this for lower back and hip pain. It works very well on the sciatic pain I get from injury to my back and hip. the only other drug that helps is at least 800mg of motrin. Naproxen works for about 7 hours while motrin only lasts 3-4 hours. I think these basically relieve swelling pressure on the nerve column.,8
"October 30, 2011",,For Back Pain:,"These work well if you rest. Took 2 on the first day and was starting to think they were useless, took 2 the next day and by 11pm I felt so much better, had no pain and slept like a brick. The trick is to keep taking these for at least 2 days, by then you should feel better. Note to others who get given these, make sure you get given Lansoprazole as well as these protect your stomach.",9
"February 17, 2017",,"Aleve (naproxen) for Gout, Acute:",Slight pain reduction. But really not worth noting. It's the colcrys that really nips it in the bud when I feel an attack coming on. I've tried the aleeve a couple times when I didn't have the other media on hand. Just didn't seem to do much. Same for any other Naproxin sodium product.,3
"January 23, 2016",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Naprosyn (naproxen) for Osteoarthritis:,After 3 years on naprosyn 500 one a day I started to get irritable anxious finding fault all the time about stupid things. As soon as I stopped I was normal again .  I don't know what tablet to take now as I am very sensitive to a lot of drugs.,5
"June 17, 2009",,For Osteoarthritis:,"I took Naproxen for eight months before my doctor associated it with the severe side effect of my throat swelling and the feeling of something stuck in my throat, stomach bleeding and neck pain and enduring an oesophagoscopy.",3
"February 27, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Anaprox (naproxen) for Back Pain:,"Allergic reaction to Anaprox, this is poison I do not understand how the FDA approved this medication that almost kill me. I do not recommend it because of the dangerous side effects and should be taken out of the market. IT IS POISON AND I ONLY TOOK ONE 559 MG IN THE GENERIC FORM ( NAPROXEN )",1
"May 31, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,"For Gout, Acute:","I woke up with pain on my right toe, I have tried all home remedies and normal pain relievers like ibuprofen, paracetamol, co-codmol, anadin but still had pain and swelling on my foot for 9 days , my doctor prescribed me naproxen I took 1000mg after dinner and cannot believe within 1 hour my pain started to ease, after 6-7 hours I'm almost pain free, my pain is gone but still have some stiffness and very very minor pain on walk, I'm sure after taking 1 or 2 more dose  I’ll be jumping again on my feet.",10
"December 16, 2015",,For Back Pain:,"Naproxen helped to lessen the pain of herniated discs, but I experienced shortness of breath and was only able to get through 10 mins of cardio class. Before Naproxen I would complete 60 - 90 mins of cardio. I stopped the drug immediately, that was 6 months ago and I still have shortness of breath and can't do cardio class at all. this drug should be pulled from the market.",4
"July 28, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"As a mail carrier, I walk 11 miles a day for the last 22 years. Inflammation in my knees has really affected me, making my day difficult and painful to get the job done. 2 Aleve gelcaps work WONDERS and in less than 10 minutes!",10
"October 24, 2014",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I have used most of the narcotics on the list, and now that I live in Florida it is almost impossible to get a Doctor to prescribe anything other than Aspirin.  Aspirin now has caused my stomach to act up due to ulcers so now I also need to take Prilosec 40 mg.  So far this is the best of these medicines on the list.",8
"July 5, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Osteoarthritis:,"I have gout arthritis osteoarthritis , and probably tendinitis I have had a very hectic sporting life ,

I first went onto diclofenac but was put on naproxen safer drug I found them both brilliant had no side effects but I am concerned of the long term side effects , you can't stop the aging process    but this helps , and if you start a fitness regime hopefully theses will help with the pain when getting there .",10
"January 7, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Muscle Pain:,"Pharmacist offered this for joint/muscle pain, related to unknown condition (possibly beginning of rheumatoid or reactive arthritis).  After I took 220mg, it made me calm, painless, but I also felt kind of isolated, and deeply depressed. An irrational feeling of untouchable, undefinable empty sadness. I felt very bad, could not stop the whole experience. I was happy it was the end of the day and so I went to bed. The painkiller effect and anti inflammatory effect was however very effective. It erased all my pain in my muscles. But be careful, if you are sensitive. I did not have suicidal thoughts, but I was close to it! I felt if I would watch a very sad documentary about all the bad things humans did.",
"May 4, 2020",,For Period Pain:,"Honestly had the worst experience with naproxen. 
1. It seems like it takes extremely long to work. 
2. I can use codeine, paracetamol and mefenamic acid together and that works way better. 

Over all experience it really didn't help me at all. 
Am I doing something wrong ?",1
"May 20, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Osteoarthritis:,"I am waiting for hip surgery as osteoarthritis set in due to an accident in my youth. My left leg has always been shorter and I've had Osteopath treatment off an on, though pain has never stopped me leading a very active life. The pain now is appalling, Panadol and Ibobrufen help but I still limp painfully. Have a little indigestion as well. I thought weight-gain i was having was due to lack of mobility but it was bloating side effect due to the Brufen.  I can't take codeine so was prescribed Naproxyn as Ibobrufen wasn't cutting it for the pain. Naproxyn took a few days to even work and the pain was not alleviated enough to warrant putting up with extreme queasiness, flatulence, slight depression (Can't afford to start down a negative track before my operation with so much pain ahead!). Back on Ibuprufen despite the bloating.",5
"September 20, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Tendonitis:,I went for a walkabout in Australia wearing inappropriate footwear and developed tendonitis on my right heal. I was told by the doctor to stick to over the counter pain killers but none of them worked over a 4 week period. When I returned to the UK my doctor prescribed 500 Naproxen and 15 mg Lansoprazole Gastro-Resistant capsules. After 2 doses the month long pain subsided and I had no side effects. This medicine relaxed the tight tendon within a day. The problem has not returned so I can keep dancing. Great medicine.,10
"May 28, 2016",,For Pain:,"I was given this by the A&E Dept for multiple knee ligament rupture. Within an hour of taking: extreme vertigo, nausea, sweats, vomiting, diarrhoea and disorientation. Symptoms last for days. Don't risk it.  Just take something else.",1
"April 24, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,"I have severe period pain that's just gotten worse over the years. My doctor put me on Naproxen along with birth control for the pain, but neither of them help me a lot. Naproxen takes the edge off a little bit and worked well at first, but not so much after a few months.",2
"January 8, 2014",,For Pain:,"Naproxen was prescribed (x2 250mg ) for headaches I have been getting. Didn't seem to do a thing for that. However, the aches and pains in my joints (and trigger-finger related tendons) I have had for years go away pretty quickly. I feel 250mg lasts ~6hours until the pain starts to come back.",7
"April 24, 2013",,For Pain:,"Injured my ankle one day and this caused me to sit around for two weeks. Normally, I have a very active lifestyle but sitting for two weeks caused a old knee injury to flare up. To make this short I take naproxen once every morning and have had very little pain since. ",10
"October 20, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,For Pain:,"Dumb doctors prescribed me this junk for a week for my damaged rotator cuff that has started to act up with medium labor and cause my whole arm to go cold and throb with pain. My hand also is going numb towards the end of the day. It did not touch my pain whatsoever. Instead it caused me to be fatigued, dizzy, raised my blood pressure, and made me feel like throwing up due to the terrible taste that lasted an hour and upset stomach that I had while the ""medication's"" effects lasted. This stuff is absolutely terrible, and so are any physicians that prescribe it. DO NOT TAKE IT. Ibuprofen lessened my pain at least a little bit with no side effects.",1
"March 22, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,For Period Pain:,I for one have horrible period cramps I have tried so many over-the-counter pain relievers and none of them worked then I tried naproxen and it changed my life I was actually able to get up and go outside and do my work I highly recommend it it's a great lifesaver if you have severe cramps like I do I have severe cramps to the point where I'm on the floor crying and almost vomiting and naproxen has held it back I mean help the pain back quite a bit love it. Its great and you don't need a perscription.,10
"October 22, 2013",,For Tendonitis:,"Excellent medication. After taking a week of standard ibuprofen to treat tendonitis on my foot, I turned to naproxen. Within 2 doses the pain has stopped completed.

A few months ago I'd had some problems with my hip and similarly within 2 doses the pain settled completely.",10
"February 22, 2016",,"For Gout, Acute:",Was not happy with result initially as I was following dosage on label. After switching to dosage recommendation found here and elsewhere the change was almost immediate and greatly improved. I get attacks averaging once a year usually brought on during weight loss when I don't keep up with the amount of recommended liquids.,9
"April 30, 2018",,For Pain:,"A complete joke.  I just went to the emergency room from a fall.  Torn rotator cuff and ligaments, prescribed naproxen.  Has not touched the pain.  Then I’m reading it’s great for menstrual cramps and headaches, but not for this.  Thanks to the ER Dr - NOT.",1
"August 21, 2011",,For Back Pain:,"I strained my back while lifting. The pain was very bad, I couldn't walk or get out of bed. Took naproxen and within hour I could walk and move again. But I wouldn't say the pain was completely gone. There was still soreness but this medicine made the pain at least bearable.",8
"May 21, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Headache:,"THE ONLY DRUG THAT HELPS ANY PAIN I HAVE IN MY BODY! From migraines to severe period cramps. Naproxen 500mg twice a day (sometimes I even do three times a day) is seriously the only thing that saves me! If the pain is that bad, I will take a Tylenol with it, but normally it does the trick on its own.",10
"March 29, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Back Pain:,"I suffer with chronic backpain, Naproxen is the only painkiller to ease it. Take it with Omeprazole though as it can give you stomach ulcers/bleeding which I had when I was taking it everyday. I now just take it as and when required and with omeprazole",10
"September 1, 2018",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Neck Pain:,"I found it as most effective medication for cervical pain with compression syndrome, with minimal or no side effects.  I've  being taken at night after meal for many years. Just do not overdose! and find minimal effective dose for your condition. Naproxen is the best!",
"October 26, 2008",,For Tendonitis:,"I am taking this medicine for Tendonitis from shoulder to wrist. Before Naproxen I had zero strength and very minimal movement. After a week on Naproxen (after 2 hours) I have most movement and strength.
Side effects are nausea but it is mild. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory properties are just as beneficial to healing, as is the pain relief (relaxation of tendons). ",8
"August 28, 2019",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"For Gout, Acute:","Just a quick comment.  
I have had gout for 5 or so years, both feet, sides, tops, toes and occasionally in my knees.
The only drug I have found to work is Naproxen (Feminax Ultra in the UK). 
Catching it early is key as previous posts, 500mg at start, and I top up with paracetamol after 3 hours, then take 250mg Naproxen 3 hours after, followed by 2 paracetamol 3 hours after and a 500mg before bed.  If you don’t catch it early enough, it can last days, my longest so far has been 8 days.  
I also take cherry extract capsules daily, along with celery seed extract.  If you can find them, dark red cherries help flush out the kidneys and are a natural anti inflammatory, so once a week a top up of these won’t do you any harm, nor will bananas every day.",8
"November 28, 2011",,For Period Pain:,"I am on my second day of using naproxen due to my really bad period pain. I usually have to take time off work and am left crying in pain for the first few days of my period. So far, the only thing that naproxen has stopped for me is the pain that makes me cry. The pain is still very strong. ",3
"November 1, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"I was proscribed 500mg tablets to help with a sprained lumbar. The pharmacist told me that at worst i would experience indigestion, and it should not be combined with other pain medication or else I'd deal with internal bleeding. What i wasn't ready for was crippling fatigue, vision impairment, nausea, urine darkening, cold sweats, and my back pain getting even worse. I looked up the side effects that the pharmacist didn't mention and found then listed under the Uncommon and Rare side effects, which means I'm just unlucky.",1
"August 22, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Headache:,"I purchased liquid capsules Aleve for a headache. I took 2 and I didn't experience any relief at all over a 10 hour period. The pills are very large, but the gel capsule made swallowing easier. I wouldn't purchase these again.",1
"August 13, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Aleve (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"I too cannot believe how well Aleve works! I've had bad cramps, pain and misery that lasted for two days, interrupting my life every month and giving a feeling of dread each time 'that time' approached. My sister mentioned recently that Aleve helped her, so I tried it. For the second month now, I am able to function with pretty mild symptoms! It's a miracle. So happy to have found this!! Wish I'd known about it 10 years ago, to think the suffering was so simply solved. So grateful.",10
"July 30, 2020",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Period Pain:,"My period pain is the absolute most painful thing. I get cold sweats , dizzy , nauseous. But when I talked to my doctor , they prescribed me Naproxen at 500 MG and when I take it 2 days before I feel no cramps. You have to make sure to track your period so you don’t feel any pain & to get ahead of the pain.",10
"March 25, 2011",,Midol Extended Relief (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"Midol Extended Relief is the best pain reliever for my period.  I used to take 800mg Ibuprofen because I get terrible cramping, now I prefer the Midol.  I don't have to take it as often and since it is Midol it relieves more than just the cramps.  Every woman in my office uses it for cramps.",10
"September 19, 2015",,For Pain:,"I have chronic pain and tendinitis in my ankles, knees, shoulders, and elbows. I've played competitive softball and basketball my whole life and now play for my high school. Without naproxen it usually hurts so bad I can't play at all but I take 3 of them at once and it usually takes care of most of the pain. There is still some pain left but it usually helps significantly. I just wish you could take more than one dose a day because I usually need a second one",8
"December 21, 2020",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Aleve (naproxen) for Muscle Pain:,"I was using regular Aleve, for muscle, knee & back pain,  it was not helping, I tried the aleve for muscle and back pain, a year ago, this is the only thing that has helped,  I have used it  one pill per day, ever since,  I have not even worn the knee bandage since, this is for me",10

It worked well for the first few months. It did not completely eliminate my pain but the pain was not nearly as bad as before. After about 4 months of taking it I began to notice side effects such as racing heart beat, difficulty swallowing, and constipation among others. I quickly stopped taking it after noticing these side effects.",6
"December 1, 2017",,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I had a toe injury and I took Aleve extra strength. Let me just say, this was the best decision I could have made. I went from not being able to walk in the morning, to jumping off a stage. I HIGHLY recommend Aleve. I have never been so impressed with a medication. I wish I could shoot a commercial for Aleve because they deserve it.",10
"October 16, 2017",,For Tendonitis:,"I went to the doctor after having pain in my elbow, I thought tennis elbow my doctor dismissed it as tendonitis an quickly prescribed me Naproxen 500mg to be taken twice daily. I made sure I took after food on the and third day in I started experiencing stomach pain and indignation/ heart burn.  This continued over next 2 days with increased pain and feeling bloated, on the fifth day a stiffness started creeping in all over my body so bad that I couldn't take my own clothes off.  It is now day 6 I haven't taken any tablets and had to spend the day in bed. It has even made my breasts feel very sore. I feel as though I've been in an horrendous car crash.  I will definitely not be taking this drug ever again. I'm usually a very fit 49 year old,",1
"November 14, 2017",,Aleve (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"Aleve has been a miracle drug for me. I’m not one to write reviews on anything but I can tell you from my experience today that I was in so much pain from menstrual cramps that I was crying. I took two extra strength Tylenol and it took two hours to work and when it did work I still felt a lot of pain but still not as much as before. Then, I took two Aleve and it completely knocked it out.",10
"October 17, 2017",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Back Pain:,"Herniated disc T4 and narrowing of spinal column in my neck. Over last few years I have suffered from flare ups of back pain which spread throughout the spine and into other joints and this has deteriorated after the herniated disc. I am guessing this is a type of arthritis.

The good news is naproxen works well and quickly and settles everything down within 1 to 2 days.  I don't like to keep taking it but after a week or two the pain returns and I need the drugs again and I am starting to think the pain is returning quicker and more severe to the extent that I may be more and more reliant?

However, 18 months after the herniated disc and thinking I might not walk properly again I'm running again and pain free on the drugs.",8
"February 26, 2017",,For Muscle Pain:,"Previous had this prescribed to me for Back Pain several year ago. 500mg twice a day and it certainly used to take the edge off the pain. Of course it won't eradicate the pain, it's only a mild NSAID not an opioid. Recently been using 500mg per day for a week for calf strain from running injury. Really helped in the first 48hrs. It seem there's a few comments on here regarding allergic reactions. Allergies to aspirin and other NSAID are common. If you are not allergic, then I recommend Naproxin as a starting point.",10

I took three tables in 36 hours (making sure after lunch and dinner and with plenty of water) and after taking second pill on the fist day, I had terrible time. I couldn't sleep, have severe funny feeling in my stomach, right under my ribs and just above the stomach. I had strong empty-stomach feeling all the time. The feel for my whole body was terrible and I feel super-sick. I didn't throw up or had loose-motions but had lots of stomach pain and extreme heart-burn. 

I stopped taking medicine after 3 pills and informed my doctor.",1
"January 14, 2010",,For Period Pain:,"My menstrual cramps have always been out of control. I would miss school and work every month for 2 or 3 days doing nothing but laying in bed with a heating pad, overdosing on Midol, and crying my eyes out. I would be in so much pain. Once I matured and moved from seeing a pediatrician to a gynecologist 3 years ago my doctor prescribed me Naproxen for my extreme pain. For the most part it relieves me of all my pain, but every now and then (even with the naproxen) my period still hits me pretty hard but it is bearable.",9
"May 7, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,"For Gout, Acute:",Aleve worked great for my big toe gout. The trick is in the right dose for your situation. Woke up at 2am with burning pain in my big toe.

"October 16, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"I am pretty sure this medication is just acid in pill form. And not the fun kind either. No. I took this medication for severe arthritis and fybromialgia and 15 minutes later my whole esophogus feels like it's on fire. I took the medication with food as prescribed and still this is the worst heartburn I have ever had in my life. I used to have severe ulcers, and I know when a medication is burning my stomach lining. No sir. No more ulcers for me thank you.
I also had the alarming sensation of hearing everything while under water. I spent the whole week asking people to repeat themselves because their voices sounded muffled. That with severe ringing in the ears and persistent nausea-I quit this medication after a week.",4

I had an attack at work which hit my top left ankle like an arrow. It only took an hour and I was hobbling, I took my lunch break ate a muffin and popped an naproxen INZA 500. OMG Its incredible!
Withinn 10 mins the pain began to disolve, within 20 mins I could stand and bear the pain. In 30-50 mins Im beginning to walk without hobbling or hopping.
I lie to you not by the time im driving home and hanging up my work jacket its almost nothing. No pain, Im walking as if nothing happened, I can still feel a type of numbness or stiffness where the pain was but its so insignificant.
I can sleep good tonight. Thank you INZA 500",8
"July 15, 2009",,For Period Pain:,"Wow. I have tried all kinds of over the counter medicines like Midol, Tylenol, and Advil for period pain. Midol seemed to help the best, but it just wasn't enough. My doctor prescribed me Naproxen. I'm so glad she did. It's all I need for cramps now. It works fast, too. I'd say it takes around 15 or 20 minutes to kick in. I just took one this morning, and my pain is almost all the way gone already. The directions say to take it the day before it starts, which is hard for me to predict sometimes, but if I take it at the right time, I experience almost no pain during my period. I also get migraines, and if I feel one coming on, I take one of these, then take a nap. When I wake up, the pain is usually gone. I'm taking 250 mg.",10
"September 27, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"This is my first time using Aleve and it has worked wonders for me. I cannot believe how well it has worked so far! I have had severe cramps since I was 12 years and have tried so many pain relievers that haven't worked so well. I took 2 pills about 20 minutes after I started cramping and 20 minutes later, I was all good! For 24 hours! The third day is usually my worst but I took two pills and I was good for about 17 hours then I took 1 pill and I was good for another 9 hours. And it doesn't make me nauseated! So glad I found this, I just hope it keeps on working like this.",10
"August 8, 2015",,For Muscle Pain:,"I pulled a muscle in my back on a Saturday. The pain was intense. Sleepless nights because of the pain. I started taking paracetamol and ibuprofen which did help during the day time. But once you have a sleep waking up was painful.

Xrays revealed nothing (although at 62 I highly suspect some type of osteoarthirits), 6 sessions of therapy to correct what was a suspect patellar tracking disorder aggravated the condition, chiropractor, massage, Voltaren gel rubbed in the knee. Nothing brought long term relief. Three weeks ago I decided to give Alleve a try. And so far it's worked. I take one before bed. My knee occasionally hurts, but the tight hamstrings and sciatic have cleared up.",9

"April 12, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Period Pain:,"I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg after going through severe post period cramps, I have tried Advil and Tylenol but none of them worked.

I have also taken Naproxen 375mg as needed. I’m a 72 years old woman still working full time in front of a computer all day and sometimes my back and neck pain is unbearable. The only thing that reduces my pain is taking Aleve gels before I leave for work as Sulfasalazine nor Naproxen have done enough.",9
"December 6, 2015",,For Sciatica:,"I have been taking naproxen on and off for years.Usually for back pain.It is the best treatment I have received .After 3 weeks of sciatica I started taking it again.This time it has helped,but I have a funny taste in my mouth and my mouth feels sore,my lips are slightly swollen as well.I will leave it off for a while and see if it feels better.

Every single month I would throw up all day from the pain. I had tried every medication, then my doctor suggested Naproxen 500mg. What a miracle ! once kicks , I feel no cramps ! and for me , one pill lasts for 12+ hours. I can finally live a normal life :) the only downside is it does upset my stomach, so I take it with an anti emetic !",
"December 20, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Neck Pain:,"Experienced a neck injury (occipital neuralgia) so had Cervical Neuralgia / Occipital Neuralgia.  The Dr. prescribed naproxen.  Now that I have experienced a horrible, terrible and destructive medical condition directly from naproxen, I strongly recommend to everyone, if this drug is prescribed to you, drop the prescription into the toilet and run away as fast as you can!!! This horrible drug depleted my iron to the stage of anemia, which of course depletes CBC count in hematology. Now I am in 6-7 months of slowly rebuilding my iron, which rebuilds hematology.",
"February 26, 2012",,For Back Pain:,"Did not help much with the pain. After 2 months on this medicine my blood pressure started to spike and I have had  five trips to the ER with blood pressure at 180/120, severe dizziness and chest pain. Both a persistant dull pain and stabbing pain at different locations in my chest and abdomen. One week of and the dizzines and chest pain is gone. Blood preasure high still but better.

"July 26, 2016",,For Period Pain:,"I used to just take ibuprofen and that would only take the edge off but I will still be in a lot of pain that I have vomited before and had to go home from work. Then I tried taking ibuprofen and paracetamol at the same time, 2 of each every 4 hours which was better but I could still feel the pain. Then someone suggested I try Naproxen and it has honestly changed my life. Now I only need to take 2 the first time and then 1 every 6-8 hours and I am almost totally pain free. I'm just kicking myself I didn't try it 10 years ago. I'm Australian so I just buy it over the counter and it about $20 for a packet.",10

"September 9, 2015",,For Tendonitis:,"Was prescribed drug for Achilles tenditis, 500mg Naproxen twice a day with omeprazole 20 mg.  Should never have taken this as caused heartburn and stomach infection, stopped taking on second day and still have not recovered from stomach problems over 2 months later despite taking other remedies.  Disgusting drug!!!",1
"January 30, 2012",,For Period Pain:,My gynecologist suggested I take one of these at the first twinge of a cramp.  Every now and then I get horrible debilitating cramps.

"December 16, 2013",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I have Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and pain is an everyday thing, especially with scoliosis.

I switched to Aleve and as soon as I took those first two pills, I couldn't believe the results; my pain was gone an about an hour later.",8
"July 20, 2011",,For Osteoarthritis:,"I have been taking Naproxen for 7 months 500mg and it is very effective but does have an impact on the stomach. I recently caught gastroenteritis and what normally lasts for 48 hours lasted 11 days, which may have been down to my weakened stomach lining. I was dehydrated and lost 1.5 stone. I am now going to try and manage the pain with ibuprofen and paracetamol.",7
"November 27, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,"For Gout, Acute:","I'm 31. First time I've ever had an acute gout attack on my left foot big toe. This pain had me in tears. I'm a stubborn guy and normally don't take meds for anything. This pain forced me to find a doctor, who ended up prescribing Naproxen 500 mg. It works, but not as fast as I would have liked it to. I was still in pain 2 hours after taking it. Crying my eyes out. 4 hours later the pain was lessened. But not by much. Still enough for me to fall asleep. 6-8 hours later pain had lessened but not by much it was still uncomfortable to fall asleep....also a slight discomfort in my stomach (side effect?).  After 11 hours later throbbing needle pain that I've been feeling has subsided 90 percent.  I took my second dose and it's been maintaining so far. However, I still can barely walk. Hurts when I stand on it... it's been 2 full days with this gout thing.",7
"October 23, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Aleve (naproxen) for Headache:,Took 3 Aleve liqued gels within 2 hrs and it progressive made my headache worse and I had an event to go to later that evening too. Not very reliable. Advil works more effectively even if I have to take 3+,1
"January 21, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,"Typically my cramps are so intense that I cannot leave my bed, and am typically stuck in the fetal position for most of the day due to pain. Naproxen helps with this, the only downside being it knocks me out for about 4-6 hours.",8
"June 28, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Period Pain:,"My periods are about 8 days long and extremely painful. Naproxen is a GODSEND. I have tried birth control on multiple occasions and brands, I just don’t like it and it didn’t make my periods any less painful. I take Naproxen a few days before my period begins and then every 12 hours for the most painful days of my period and it is so much less debilitating. I HIGHLY recommend Naproxen to anyone, but the kicker is this: you have to take Naproxen BEFORE your cramps begin or right as they’re about to get worse. Naproxen is preventative from what I understand. Advil barely works for me, but I really don’t know what I would do without naproxen.",10
"December 17, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Tendonitis:,"Was prescribed prescription strength Naproxen for a Rotator Cuff injury, let me tell you....took it around dinner time and about 45 min later got the WORST stomach pain I’ve ever experienced.

"July 9, 2011",,For Back Pain:,"(Male, 42yrs, 220lbs, active/athletic). I take 375mg once in the morning for the relief of occasional (4-5 times a year) severe back muscle pain. While it unfortunately takes 2-4 hours for me to feel the effects, when it has been absorbed it gives me 90-100% relief and the benefits last for roughly 48 hours. This is by far the best pain reliever I have ever used. As for adverse side effects, luckily I can't seem to detect any. ",10
"July 30, 2016",,For Back Pain:,"I am having severe pain on my right shoulder, radiating to my elbow, and a numbed index finger.  I was prescribed 500 mg of naproxen twice daily.

"September 21, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Aleve (naproxen) for Ankylosing Spondylitis:,"I have AS and have been in a flare up for about a week now. Hurting from my pelvis to my feet, it was causing extreme difficulty with walking.  Haven’t wanted people to notice the few times I’ve had to get out of the house so would walk decently with excruciating pain. My feet have been hurting everywhere, with painful throbbing and stabbing pain with every step.  I have been feeling shocks in my left hip area with my steps, almost sending me to the floor at times.  Last night, after I got in bed, the throbbing pain was keeping me awake so I got up and took two Aleve gel tabs.  Within 30 min, while lying in bed, I noticed the throbbing had stopped.  Upon awakening and standing I was much better.  I could not believe the difference in my gait with my pain level dropping significantly today.  I feel so much better now!  Thank goodness",9
"December 7, 2009",,For Osteoarthritis:,"I suffer from severe arthritis due in part to extensive cervical fusion. About 2 months ago my doctor prescribed Naproxen and I am pleasantly surprised with the results so far. While I am not a fan of NSAIDs *any* relief from this pain is worth the risk.

It doesn't do much for breakout pain but when I get that nagging pain in my neck it does help, but only in conjunction with a pain killer.",8
"September 19, 2015",,For Back Pain:,"I've had sciatica pain for the past few days. Tried Tylenol 3, Advil and regular Tylenol with codeine. Nothing worked so I tried Aleve. Took 1 the first day and didn't feel a difference at all. Got brave and took 2 today, even though these are supposed to last 12 hours and it didn't feel any different. Personally speaking this medicine is a waste of money and doesn't work at all.  This is a medicine that works especially on muscle pain and I felt no difference period. I do not recommend this to anyone. Go to your doctor and get something prescribed.",1
"December 28, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,"For Gout, Acute:","Within hours of taking the naproxen medication I felt relief from my gout. It does what it says but along with that I had to endure the worst stomach cramps, diahhrea, trapped wind and gas all the time I was taking it. But I’ve not been able to walk well for a long time so discovering I had gout and getting rid of the pain when walking my agility back  is well worth it.  I also had a frozen shoulder which  I could hardly move and the naproxen got rid of that which was an added bonus",9
"March 22, 2016",,For Period Pain:,"I had really bad cramps. I tried several things, and nothing seem to work. When I get them bad I have  to miss school and just lay in my bed with  back pain, headache, barf etc. So I had enough and decided to go to the doctors. My doctors prescribe me for naproxen. On the day of my cycle I took the pill and in about 30 minutes I was pain free. I took a nap and it felt like I didn't even have my period! I definitely recommend this, I am very pleased and this will be my go to every month. but remember, what works for me doesn't work for all.",8
"September 16, 2017",,Aleve (naproxen) for Osteoarthritis:,"It seems like other OTC pain relief pills work much better, e.g. ibruprofen, aspirin, tylonol.  I just try to get by on one aleve taken around 5 a.m.  because I take four other pills each day at 5 p.m.   I have just experienced several days with dizzyness.

"December 19, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,For Pain:,"Naproxen has never worked well for me.  I thought it was odd when the doctor told me it was the strongest thing available.  I took 600 mg which worked for 2 hours. I spent the next 10 hours looking at the clock, crying and thinking of how to get illegal drugs for the 1st time in my life. The doctor would not give me anything stronger. I have never used any other person's prescription, but I finally got an oxycodone pill from a relative who recently had surgery.  I took one, slept through the night and the pain was much more bearable for the next few days.  One pill worked.",1
"September 30, 2010",,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I love Aleve, but people should talk to their doctor first.

"April 16, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Fever:,"Worked better than Tylenol to control fever, and works longer. 1g Tylenol brought my 101 fever down to 99, while 440mg of Naproxen sodium knocked the same 101 fever the next morning down to my normal temp of 96.",10
"August 4, 2012",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Pain:,Suffered neck and spine pain for years. One night I took it and was I surprised how great this medicine worked.

I will feel uncomfortable a couple of days before bleeding and then hit like a freight train, the first day of bleeding and usually leading into day 2. The kind of pain where I can't think straight and feel the urge to vomit and poop all at once. I have often had to miss work due to the severity of pain. Finally after being fed up with Ibuprofen not working at all anymore, I went to a dr and was prescribed naproxen 500mgs. I find that when I take one 500mg pill at the first tinge of pain, I am usually experiencing relief within 30 minutes. I also find that when I drink LOTS of water with the dosage it kicks in even sooner than 30 minutes. In hind-sight I wish I would have known about naproxen when I was in my teens.",9

I took it for a little more than a week and on the 10th day, I woke up to horrible chest pains.  I'm 36 years old and don't believe I have a heart condition.  I stopped taking the pills and the pain in my chest lessened towards the end of the day.

My headaches would get so bad I'd throw up or have to go to the emergency. This drug is a miracle for me.

"August 3, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,Prescribed 750mg per day for horrendous sciatica - the effect was no better than taking smarties. 5 months later MRI scan has confirmed it was in fact a herniated disc. I ended up on 240mg per day of codeine and eventually ended up on amitriptyline too to treat 10 days and nights of extortionate pain. 5 months later don't experience a lot of pain but still have numbness in foot and difficulty walking,
"August 31, 2015",,For Muscle Pain:,Took this for a pain I have in my wrist. Don't have arthiritis. I'm 15. It's supposed to stop the swelling and pain on the palm of my hand but it's done nothing except give me all the possible side effects. It's affecting my daily routines so yeah. Not good at all really. It's a 0/10,1
"August 23, 2017",,Aleve (naproxen) for Costochondritis:,Been taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for 12 days per docs order with little relief for Chostocondritis and back pain.

"July 31, 2020",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Back Pain:,"I take naproxen OTC generic products for arthritis, ankling spondylitis, disk degeneration,  etc. It relieves most symptoms better than any of the other anti-inflammatory drugs. Never had stomach issues from taking a dose of one 220 mg every 12 hours. Have taken higher dosage for herniated disk. Husband takes also but for pain vs anti-inflammatory and finds it works well.",
"May 3, 2014",,For Muscle Pain:,"375 mg, three times a day was prescribed for my severe muscle pull near the left hip. Took the first pill at dinner time Thursday. Pain subsided a bit, but the medicine apparently wears off after 8 hours, because pain woke me up at 4:15 am Friday. Took pills at 4:30 am, 12 noon and again 8 pm.  Would estimate the pain was 1/3 less during the day. Sleep was again interrupted by hip pain: there was no positioning of the knees or legs that lessened the pain.  Today, Saturday, I took a pill at 7 am and will continue to dose every 8 hours.  Tomorrow I have to perform a concert while standing, so I'm counting on these to pull me through.   
Eager to get off these pills because of their scary effect on blood pressure.",5
"May 14, 2015",,Aleve (naproxen) for Frozen Shoulder:,Very little relief.  I finished PT and after a year it still wasn't great.  Due to other issues a physician switched me to Diflofenac Sodium (Voltarin?) which has been a wonderful.  It takes away all my joint issues.,2
"November 21, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Ankylosing Spondylitis:,Take 500mg Naproxen 2x a day which doesn’t do much of anything for my Ankylos Spondylitis. Ridiculous that it’s even recommended as part of AS treatment! On a side note as a woman it slows mensuration down to a trickle making mensuration last even longer which is extremely fricking annoying especially with AS!,
"March 13, 2015",,For Muscle Pain:,"I was introduced to naproxen sodium a couple years ago and it worked great for muscle pain. However, recently I took some for neck pain and instantly went into severe anafelactic shock. While on the highway, luckily my fianc",1

"March 17, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"I just started taking naproxen 375 mg twice a day and at first the pain in my hand went away. But then the side effects kicked in. Nauseated, dizzy, lethargic, black stool, vomiting, headaches and horrible neck pain. 
I am done with these pills. I am going back to Advil. That also worked for me. Even after both my hip replacements.",2
"June 23, 2009",,For Pain:,"So far so good, for chronic neck pain/spasm. It's the first time I've tried it and my neck has never felt better. The only side effect has been mild heartburn but I'd rather that than not being able to move my neck.",
"April 26, 2012",,Leader Naproxen Sodium (naproxen) for Ankylosing Spondylitis:,"I too have Ankylosing Spondylitis and it started when I was only 19. The flares of inflammation were 6 months apart in the first couple years. When I got my first bad flare though I thought I was going to die. Finally after a month of not being able to move, sit-up, walk, or lay on anything but my side. I finally got out the walker and made it down the stairs although in excruciating hip pain. Felt like knives were being stabbed into my sciatic nerve. I then realized after I went to the emergency room that an NSAID was to thank for my relief! Thank you Naproxen.",
"August 23, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Tendonitis:,"I took prescription-strength naproxen after a shoulder injury. It helped with that but made pain in my knees and hips much much worse somehow.

"November 14, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Headache:,"I was just prescribed naproxen 500 mg for degenerative arthritis. It really takes the pain away from the arthritis but it also works for my wife who gets occasional menstrual headaches, migraines  and seasonal allergy sinus headaches. She also takes vistaril for allergies but it doesn't get rid of the headaches. Me personally, only Excedrin migraine extra strength...but that might be the caffeine lol",9

"July 20, 2016",,For Period Pain:,"I really love naproxen and taking it. It is really effective especially with the fact that I get such strong cramps that usually keep me in bed all day. It lets me enjoy activities without worrying about pain and how to make myself feel better. Sometimes my cramps may get so strong that I can feel cramps through it but its almost not so strong but occasionally strong. Naproxen just depends on the amount of pain you get and its always a mystery for me because i can never predict my cramps. But the point is, Naproxen always makes me feel better no matter how strong my cramps are. I recommend people to take it for ease of pain and always use it with food, trust me. I didn't once and it took away the cramps but i got such a weird stomach ache.",9
"January 29, 2021",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Period Pain:,"On day one and two of my period I used to feel like it is the end of me. I can’t even lay still because of the unbearable pain and even start crying. Ever since my doctor prescribed me naproxen I can somehow function properly again. It takes around an hour to kick in, but if I take it before the pain gets worse I can continue my daily life without any !!!! Pain.
It wears off in the late evening and that’s when I notice how well it does the job, because the pain is very bad. I take one more and then it helps me sleep very well!!

Saved my life.",10

"December 9, 2009",,For Back Pain:,Did not help my back pain at all. A week after starting the medication I had ONE glass of wine at about 8pm. Less then an hour later I passed out and did not wake up until 2pm the next day. I missed work and apparently my family was trying to wake me up but I seemed to be sleep walking and have no recollection of what I was saying. ,1
"August 28, 2013",,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I have severe chronic pain due to a car accident. I've tried every med to curb the pain. I like this medicine, the only drawback was that it wasn't long lasting and I wish I could take it more than once a day.",4
"December 8, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"I cracked a molar vertically into TWO pieces. After the initial two days (wherein a strong muscle relaxant was added to the mix) two Aleve for each dose kept me comfortable (nearly pain free unless I chewed on it) until I could get my quotes for a dental implant and get the offending tooth extracted.

"December 14, 2020",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Osteoarthritis:,"I’ve been taking these naproxen on and off for years relating to joint pain. Most prominent in my back, feet and knees. I’ve finally said enough is enough. I might as well be popping candy. They are a complete waste of time. I get zero benefit from them but am fortunate that I don’t get any side effects with the exception of heartburn. I know several people that take them and no one can say in my circle  they are a benefit to them. I’ve now had to resort to Nurofen Plus which financially is crippling but they at least give me some very mild relief.",1
"December 4, 2017",,For Rheumatoid Arthritis:,"After five consecutive days of being in constant and intolerable pain, the only medicine that reduced my pain was Naproxen 500 mg.

"June 29, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Tendonitis:,"I love Aleve!  I've been lifting weights for more than 20 years and started having tendonitis in my elbows a few years ago.  Often times all I'd have to do is take Aleve and rest for a day or two and the pain would go away.  This time I'm having to lay off the heavy weights (for good) and wear the brace, but use Aleve as well.  The combination of the two is really working!  I started out taking it twice a day, but have gone down to once a day.  I plan to do that for a week or two.",8

I’d be lost without it tho ",8
"December 15, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,"Of the various OTC pain medications I have tried, Aleve has worked the best.  Though I'm not so much of a stickler when it comes to only buying name brands (oftentimes I've found that generics work just fine), I find that the name-brand Aleve has more of a positive effect for me than generic naproxen.  Nevertheless, I keep a bottle of Aleve nearby at all times.  It truly helps.",10
"May 1, 2012",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Pain:,This is the best non-narcotic pain reliever that I've ever used. Motrin makes me throw up if I don't take it with food. It makes me nauseous even with food. Aspirin is a sugar pill for me and Exedrin just gets me high on caffeine. This really gets rid of the pain.,10
"February 25, 2009",,For Tendonitis:,Medicine worked great. Took 1 tablet a day to keep the knee swelling and stiffness away. Only side effects seem to be bloating and gas.

It starts working in like 15 minutes or so.",9
"November 18, 2020",,For Pain:,"I love naproxen

"November 5, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Period Pain:,I was switched to naproxen for heavy periods due to mefenamic supply problems. I have continued with it as I found it reduced my flow more than mefanmic acid did. In terms of pain Naproxen certainly eases the pain from menstruation cramping but doesn’t eliminate it to a comfortable level and I was having to take regular paracetamol on top. A few months ago I was prescribed buscopan for IBS and my GP advised me to use it for period cramps too. To my surprise the combination of naproxen and buscopan has helped greatly during my period and when I’m ovulating. So  I rarely need to stay curled up in bed clutching a hot water bottle like I used to have to do.,5

Have a active lifestyle. I’ve worked with my primary physician, podiatrist and now I’m being referred to a Rheumatologist. Hope they have some new ideas.

"August 20, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Back Pain:,"Naproxen has not helped my pain one bit. I've been on one 1000mg tablet a day for 3 weeks. I've had so many side effects to this medication but my Dr doesn't care and told me to keep taking it. I'm also on 1800mg a day of gabapentin (for nerve related pain) 40-60mg of oxycodone a day (for back pain; 2 prolapsed discs as well as spinal stenosis and age degeneration) and 30mg of baclofen (muscle relaxer) even being on all these tablets I still can't walk or stand for more than 15 minutes at a time unless I have my crutches or a trolley to take weight off.

I got the treatment from several doctors, in several Hospitals at different place ,I was getting relief but only for few months and after few months I used to same pain.  I suffered approximately 10 years from this pain . 
Finally or you can say luckily I had treatment from one of Doctors from his private clinic in Chennai , and he wrote only this TABLETS along with OCID 20. and now I am 100 % free from pain since last 7 years .
I am very grateful to that Doctor and this medicine .
One of my acquaintance was suffering from same kinds of pain and I suggested him to take the same tablet and now he is all right.

"April 2, 2016",,For Period Pain:,"Took two OTC. While it took the edge off the most extreme pain, was still very uncomfortable. I have a very high pain tolerance as I was a professional dancer, and martial artist. What annoys me is that you can't take anymore for 12 hours. Severe pain started coming back after 8 hours. I'd rather go back to my 4-5 Advil every 4 hours than this.",4
"September 11, 2017",,For Tendonitis:,"My Dr prescribed 500mg  twice a day as needed for mu shoulder pain.  I immediately had stomach pain and nausea so I  only took it once daily at bedtime as my shoulder pain is worse at night.  Pain went away but the nausea and stomach pain is back along with headaches.  I quit completely 3 days ago; nausea and headache still present at times but getting better.  Naproxen is history for me, never again.  Good old Tylenol will have to do from now on.",
"April 25, 2020",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,I have PCOS and it makes my periods nearly unbearable. Most things don’t work but naproxen works so well. I also have ovary pains where I have cysts and it really helps them too. This is the only pain medication I’ve gotten real results from.,10
"June 19, 2008",,For Pain:,"Naproxen is working fine for me, no visible side effects. I damaged my right wrist 15 years ago cutting nerves (veins and major artery). Most of my pain is through nerve damage. Naproxen relives pain, sort of takes the edge off.",9
"December 13, 2019",,For Period Pain:,"I took the naproxen after eating some food, but I was waiting hours and nothing happened.

Instantaneously felt like I was having a heart attack, the following day my knees became swollen and  I couldn't walk. Three weeks later I still feel like I am having a heart attack. This product is the direct cause and the doctors have yet to figure out what it is. My chest keeps swelling up randomly, I have a one year old and a three year old and hate the thought I might die from taking one dumb pill for pain. Never again I'll just take the pain.",1
"March 29, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Naprelan (naproxen) for Period Pain:,"Works great for menstrual pain and doesn't hurt my stomach like other naproxen, as long as I take it on a full stomach. I take one and it works all day. Only draw back is the cost, so my doctor stocked me up on samples. Even with insurance it was outrageous.",10
"April 11, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Period Pain:,"I am overweight which brings more unnecessary pain to my cramps, as well as having bad cramps runs in my family. I am not new to naproxen but one day when I woke up at night in severe pain where I wanted to poop, puke and die, I took one and hopped in n the shower.

"April 11, 2010",,For Period Pain:,"One thing I've learned is to avoid dairy products and too much fat about a week to 10 days before my period. I helps a lot with reducing bloating and cramps. I still have to use medication to control the cramps, but no dairy makes a huge difference.",7
"July 23, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Period Pain:,Has been amazing for my period pain. Nothing seemed to work and I would be up all hours of the morning not being able to sleep. The pain was so unbearable. My doctor the prescribed 500mg naproxen and it’s been a life saver I’m now able to stop skipping work and social events. Takes about 30-40 mins to completely kick in and I don’t feel any pain. Haven’t noticed any side effects.,10
"September 1, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Pain:,"Gives me noticeable stomach pain on occasion and I only take when I am desperate due to the risk of it causing stomach ulcers/intestinal bleeding in otherwise healthy people.

"May 13, 2018",Taken for 1 to 2 years,"For Gout, Acute:","For a disabling gout flare: 500mg then 250mg every 8 hrs or if pain not cleared then 2x 250mg twice or up to 3x (ie 3x doses 500mg each) max (rarely need 3x).
Way better than colchicine but GP reckons colchicine protects body better than naproxen- much more research needed.

"December 3, 2017",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Period Pain:,"This is the only pain medication I have taken that helps with my menstrual pain.

"September 20, 2020",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Anaprox (naproxen) for Period Pain:,Anaprox is a lifesaver for migraine and endometriosis. Allowed me to function on a daily basis until I got my endometriosis diagnosis. Didn’t completely alleviate my pain but made it manageable and didn’t make me too drowsy to go about my business. Also is great for migraines if I catch them early enough. The only downsides are that I did have to increase my dose over the years and it is hard on the stomach.,8
"February 22, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Period Pain:,"Ever since I could remember I always had the worst period cramps. I would miss school, work, parties, you name it for the first 2 days of my flow because the pain was just too much to handle. I threw up every month, felt weak, faint and had a hard time even getting out of bed. A year ago I finally decided I've had enough and do not deserve to go through this pain monthly. My doctor prescribed me Naproxen 500, and although it certainly isn't a miracle worker, I am now able to go on with my life and complete my day to day tasks. The discomfort is still mildly there, but I am just so happy to not be on the toilet puking each month from the severe pain. I am able to function with Naproxen and it has helped me significantly.",7

"February 2, 2018",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Pain:,"I've been using Aleve for a couple years now for my period pain. Taking one gel capsule right as I start feeling pain seems to get rid of it altogether within about 10mins! I never really trusted that drugs worked well until I used Aleve. Now, I got my last wisdom tooth pulled yesterday. The dentist suggested Tylenol (500mg)+Advil (600mg), and wrote me a prescription for percocet (which I haven't filled yet) if I'd rather that. Tried the Tylenol/Advil combo. Barely worked. Couldn't sleep and early morning I grabbed my Aleve to see if that would help... Pain is pretty much gone unless I move that area of the mouth. I love Aleve. I put 9/10 because it failed me just once with my period. (It's possible I took it too late though.)",9
"April 24, 2018",,Aleve (naproxen) for Pain:,I have never taken Aleve before. Dr recommended for my trigger finger (inflammation)  it did help.
