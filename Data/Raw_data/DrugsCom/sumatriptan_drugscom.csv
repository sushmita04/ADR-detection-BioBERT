"January 15, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I found Imitrex works well if I take it the second I feel any of the migraine symptoms. If I wait even 20 minutes past that it'll usually make the headache worse. I suffer migraines with auras and cluster headaches. Like most everyone there is no way to function once a headache starts. Mine starts when the barometric pressure raises or lowers with cold fronts, hurricanes any weather condition that changes the barometric pressure. The pain is rough but the confusion and not able to function for sometimes days on end is the worst. Only advice I could give anyone with this drug is if you know your body well enough to know a migraine or cluster headache is starting take it immediately, don't wait! That is the only way it works for me. When it does work it is amazing! A wonderful tool to the Arsenal to fight these crippling headaches. Iif someone has never had a migraine they truly will never understand the pain we're going through.",8
"May 12, 2021",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I've never had really migraines until about 9 months ago. I had a coworker who suffered with migraines and she introduced these to me when I had a horrible headache. She took the 100 mg, and when she gave me one to take, it knocked me out into the next week. I usually have horrible period migraines and ones that I'll get on occasion. This is the only thing that works for me except I take the 50 mg. There has been a couple of times they didn't work . .but that is minimal to the times it did work. I recommend to anyone who suffers with these because I don't know how'd function without them.",9
"May 31, 2021",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I’ve gone to the emergency room with migraines many times because I was so ill.When I tried Imitrex, it was a lifesaver. I’ve only had a couple of migraines that didn’t respond to it. The only occasional side effects I’ve had with it are severe body aches. Still better than a migraine and vomiting. I probably get the body aches once out of every 30 times that I take the Imitrex. So if I have to go to bed once out of every 30 times for a migraine versus every single time, I’ll take it. I suffered debilitating migraines for years with little to no relief. Please stick to YOUR experience and not your opinion when reviewing a drug. Your experience is YOURS and it’s very short sighted to make a general statement that it should be taken off the market or that people shouldn’t take it when it’s been such a positive experience in my life and many other’s. I missed out on a lot of things with my daughters because of migraines before imitrex. It works wonders for millions.",10
"July 3, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Worst experience of my life! Started feeling jaw pain, shoulder pain, nausea, heart racing and the worst was tingly/numbing sensation in my arms and legs. I felt like I was going to die. Did not help my migraine at all. This should be taken off the market.",1
"October 30, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I couldn't live without this little pill. Imitrex/sumatriptan is a miracle drug afaik (as far as I know).  It knocks out my crippling full-body migraines every time.  So many women and some men don't even know it exists, which is a cruel twist of fate.  It should be available OTC without a prescription Imho.",10
"May 10, 2019",,For Migraine:,"Sumatriptan is a VERY dangerous drug. Prescribed 100mg  when required for migraines. I took one, and immediately I began to pour sweat, muscle in my neck and upper shoulders ached so bad it felt like I was withdrawing from a powerful opiate. Complete panic attack as well. I almost went to the ER, but stayed home and agonized thru it for 5 hours until the effects were bearable. Scariest drug I've ever taken.  PLEASE use extreme caution, I hope no one ever goes thru what I did.",1
"September 30, 2019",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Do not take this medication. Good number of patients with severe headaches may need special type of MRI to detect possible aneurysm. If patient has aneurysm and take Imitrex then they are at high risk of causing rupture in aneurysm. I had stroke and undiagnosed aneurysm was diagnosed at the time of stroke. On the date of stroke I had severe headaches and I according to the doctor if I had ended up taking Imitrex, I would not have survived, because of aneurysm. The risk factors are not disclosed precisely by manufacturers. Please stay away from that medication and take special MRI to rule out aneurysm.",1
"August 15, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Okay so I’ve been suffering from horrible migraines daily, so bad that I’m stuck in bed in horrible pain. I’m  nauseous & depressed & I have no appetite .After being prescribed the Imitrex I took it as soon as I felt the migraine come on. About 30 minutes in I started to feel my neck and throat feeling tight and my whole head have this burning sensation. I started to panic a little. Then an hour passed and I’m full blown in pain all over my body, I’m talking aching so bad it felt like I had the worst flu in history ... but my migraine was gone . Yes it took care of my migraine but were the body aches that lasted almost the whole day worth it ? I don’t think so ",3
"June 11, 2021",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I took Imitrex, for many years to knock out migraine headaches.  However, After taking for 15 years, I was getting rebound headaches. I was warned about this by the pharmacist and doctors but dismissed their concerns because nothing else worked. I realized other pain relievers could never touch any headache pain; the only way to take away headache pain was with Imitrex, migraine or not.  I struggled with tingling in my limbs and extreme sensitivity.  I finally had a wake up call when I passed out, ended up in the ER (not related to Imitrex, I don’t think) and finally went to a chiropractor who helped me get the inflammation out of my neck and shoulders through needling.  I have not had a migraine headache or a headache that a pain reliever wouldn’t work on for a year and a half. I am no longer captive to Imitrex and its side effects. I believe once on Imitrex long term, rebound headaches will occur. I am so glad I am free from the bondage.",5
"March 28, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I wanted to share a positive experience here. I've been a migraine sufferer since 17 and I am now 24. I am one of the lucky ones who found imitrex to work first try back then, and continues to take it to this day. This drug is a miracle for me. I admit that I have had to bump my doses from 50mg to 100mg, but it still works the same. I am also lucky that I only need it once a month around the  start of my period, however when I was younger I used to need them 5 times a month or so. Anyway, I just take one and in about 45-60 minutes the pain and nausea start to get better. It usually takes 90 minutes for them to be fully gone. I do sometimes get a feeling similar to whiplash (stiff neck and shoulders) and sore scalp but the side effects are far better than a migraine. My migraines stay away and I never have to take another pill, until the next month. I'm very thankful for this medicine.",9
"February 24, 2014",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I come from a family where everyone has terrible migraines. When I started getting them at age 21, I resorted to taking loads of Tylenol with Pesudophedrine to ""mask"" the pain, which took a heavy toll on my liver.  Someone suggested that I look into the Triptan family of migraine medication. After going through a few different ones, I found Imitrex to be an absolute life-saver.  Whenever I feel one coming, I take 50mg and the migraine usually disappears within 30 minutes. If I wait a few hours to take it, the response time could be more like 90 minutes. With 10-15 migraines a month, Imitrex is essentially the only thing that allows me to function. I have not seen any real side effects.",10
"June 26, 2017",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I've been experiencing migraines for about 3 years now. The pain is always on one side of my head and is completely debilitating. I used to have to take a bunch of Ibuprofen and sleep in a cool dark room until it went away which took forever. Finally, I was introduced to this medicine. I took it a few hours into my migraine and the pain was gone within 15 minutes. The medicine made me feel a little weird, like my senses were overly receptive and my skin was a bit tingly. These temporary symptoms are NOTHING compared to the migraine, I've learned to like these odd side effects because that's how I know my migraine is leaving. This is a miracle drug and over the past year I've been taking it, it's never failed to relieve the pain.",10
"November 26, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"Used to take these sumatriptan every time I had a migraine and aura 100mg and everything was fine. 
A few days ago I felt symptoms coming on and took one. Worst experience of my life. 
Severe nausea, diarrhoea, worsening of headache, chest pains, numb pain in left arm, muscle clenching involuntarily, Jaw pain, severe anxiety. Ended up in ER crying and feeling like I was high on drugs. 
Days later I do not feel myself I feel anxious, panicky and down in my mood. Please be careful these drugs are NOT safe for everyone despite me having taken them many times before. I will not ever take one again.",1
"September 22, 2014",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"My husband has always what's called prostrating attacks, which is a form of a migraine that leaves him in so much pain he can't function at all! The only medication that has ever worked on him is the Imitrex. This stuff is awesome! The only thing that is irritating is every time I get his prescription filled the pharmacist try to give him the Sumatriptan (the generic version) which makes him so sick he will throw up nonstop for hours. So I always have to tell them he needs the name brand, and I have gotten into many arguments with pharmacists trying to tell me it's the same thing. IT'S NOT!!!! When my husband takes Imitrex his migraine is gone within minutes, he takes a Sumatriptan and I feel like I need to take him to a hospital.",10
"July 16, 2019",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have had migraines since I was a kid. Diagnosed as sinus for many years until one dr asked me to try imitrex. It was like a miracle. I thought I would have to suffer with 3 to 4 day long headaches that feel like a knife in my temple the rest of my life. But imitrex knocks it out in 30-40 min. There are side effects: muscle aches, tiredness, sensitive skin and the need to pee constantly. Annoying but of you've had migraines for years it is a good trade off. I take a naproxen at the same time to help with body aches.",9
"June 22, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I suffered for years with migraines until I saw a specialist. He prescribed me 100mg dosage. I get almost instant relief. I do get a stiff neck sometimes but it only lasts about 15 minutes and my migraine is completely gone. I can’t live without this medication!,10
"February 1, 2019",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"It makes me crazy when I read that somebody waits until their headache is off the charts to take Imitrex. I have been suffering for over 25 years with migraines and then Imitrex came on the scene that was the end of the migraines. The symptoms always began behind my right eyeball and I was able to tell that's a headache was coming and that's when I took the Imitrex immediately when I started feeling symptoms not waiting until my headache is full-blown, which seems sensible to me.  It is better to knock it on the head when it isn't to back so you don't have to endure it to long.",10
"December 10, 2019",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,"I haven't had migraines in years--about 19 years. Now, every once in awhile, maybe twice a year, I get an aura. I take the sumatriptan, and I swear, within 10 to 15 minutes the aura is gone; no migraine to follow! I am so appreciative of this drug, I would like to thank the manufacturers of it. I wish that all drugs worked as well. Thank you!!",10
"January 23, 2020",,For Migraine:,I get very bad migraines that make me stay in bed for hours. I was prescribed sumitriptan and I took it to see if it worked. It did not really relieve my migraine and it made me feel nauseous and super weak. I got chest pain and my arms felt very heavy.,1
"October 30, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"After suffering from constant pounding headaches for the last two weeks this medication was a god send! I was finally diagnosed with migraines after years of headaches. I had heard some worrying things about the associated side effects but the worst it got for me was worsening of neck and shoulder pain which was there anyway . The headache was relieved in an hour, best I have felt in two weeks! Woken up today, headache free and neck is fine! 
For all you out there struggling, it’s worth a try, don’t scare yourself with potential side effects, let’s be honest you can get side effects from taking simple pain killers!",8
"December 17, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"I have been suffering from migraines for about 20 years. At first, OTC painkillers like Excedrin Migraine would do the trick, but about 10 years ago, nothing seemed to reduce the pain in the least bit. I get about 3 migraines per month that last about 3 days. My doctor prescribed Propranolol which I take twice a day and it has reduced the frequency of my attacks. I take a 50mg Sumatriptan at the first signs of a migraine and within an hour, it completely goes away. Thankfully I don’t suffer any bad side effects. I’ll feel a little foggy for a few hours but that’s about it. I literally cannot live without it! It has saved my life!",10
"October 3, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Migraine:,I am medication sensitive and was scared to take sumatriptan based on reviews. It was totally fine. Minimal side effects just fatigue—but who wants to stay awake during a migraine. I get a great sleep. Sometimes I have a bit of a migraine/medication hangover and am groggy. It’s still much better than curling up in a dark room in bed crying with an ice pack on your head wondering if you’re having a stroke or if it’s just a migraine. Take it early when you first notice symptoms! Sometimes I take it with tylanol. So glad I found this!,9
"November 21, 2019",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"I get monthly hormonal migraines (during my period), and sometimes one in the middle of the cycle. They are really, really bad. Before Sumatriptan I had to stay in bed all day, snacking on Tylenol like candy (without much effect). 
Sumatriptan does work. The key is to take it as early as possible. Just when you feel the first tingles of pain - take it. Usually in 30-40 minutes I am pain free. It does come with pretty nasty side effects. For me it's extreme weakness, very heavy feeling arms and legs, low blood pressure and general feel of being unwell. So even after taking it, I have to take it easy - just stay comfortable, watch a movie, read a book, and stay in bed. I usually feel so weak, I can barely walk. But it sure as anything beats being in such a severe pain that you consider calling an ambulance.",8
"December 31, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"Take as directed when I feel the migraine coming on and sometimes there is no change at all. Other times, like today, within 10 minutes my heart is pounding, my left jaw and nose and scalp are on fire and my migraine has advanced to dizzying pain. I have no idea what is going on, but I will be going back to tylenol until I get back to the doctor's office...",1
"August 18, 2018",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been on Imitrex for a few years now. I don't get migraines too often (luckily) but they're horrible when I do. I always try to hold off on taking Imitrex for as long as I can before I cave, which is probably not the best course of action. It does work after approx 1-2 hrs, but until the effect does work I get weird, uncomfortable side effects. My throat gets tight and it's difficult to swallow, any other muscle ache I have gets amplified, my arms/legs feel incredibly heavy and overall I just feel like I am floating in my own skin, if that even makes sense. Oh, and I have to pee every 15 mins :/",7
"May 28, 2020",,For Migraine:,I've always suffered with migraine since I was a child.  Now they are usually self-induced I don't eat right or if I go out drinking there's no sense in taking any kind of over-the-counter pain medication or even strong pain medication I just throw it up the only thing it did relieve any pain was hot water. I was introduced to Imitrex a year-and-a-half ago unbelievable when I have them with me I feel safe does it matter if I take them as soon as I feel symptoms or after the headache is gotten to me it takes it right away I take mine with one Bayer aspirin and a Sudafed 20 minutes I'm asleep wake up about 45 minutes later I feel great I think they're golden.,10
"July 10, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"This medication has improved my life so so much. Now I don't have to skip work for a 2 day migraine! 
As an example of how well sumatriptan works for me, last night I had a bad headache/ light migraine coming on while I was out drinking. I took one 25 mg pill, and within 45 minutes, I started feeling the headache dissipate significantly. By an hour, the pain was gone completely even though I was still out.  Anyway, I highly recommend trying this med even at a low dose. Personally I don't experience any side effects - don't feel weird or sleepy. Just feel soo much better! :) 
For someone who used to just suffer from multiple migraines a month, and almost overdosed on Advil due to the pain (and the Advil not helping sufficiently)... I highly recommend this med.",10
"July 2, 2014",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"Imitrex in any form is the Best med for Cluster headaches by far. High flow oxygen at first twinge, and the pill at the onset (even if you think it might hurt) Most effective. You all know how fast they come on. Usually work immediately unless late in a cycle. I too wish you could take more than twice in a 24 hr period. After suffering for almost 20 yrs with no medicine at All. For these crippling things. I have tried all Imitrex types, injections ,pills, nasal sprays. Injections are fast but so very expensive and painful as well. Nasal spray is nauseating for me, the pill form has always worked well if taken at the very BLINK of headache. Because of price and insurance restrictions I would wait to take the medicine. Not anymore.",9
"February 9, 2017",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have suffered migraines and headaches since I was little, I'am 55 years old and in physical healthy shape. I as many I have been a prisoner in my own body. I'am totally debilitated for what use to be 12 hours at a time has grown to sometimes days. I have suffered hearing loss, ringing in my ears with the fullness and so many other symptoms from sinus pressure to neck pain etc. I have at 2 different times had epidural shots in my neck for migraines and tried all kinds of pain killers and daily meds to lower the severity and frequency they occur. Last month  alone I had 18 headaches which 13 were migraines. UGH!!! The Dr. put me on Imitrex 100 to try. I was nervous but it is a miracle drug for me.",10
"October 13, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"I've had cluster headaches for about 10 years. Brutal, soul crushing headaches maybe 100 to 200 times more painful than a common tension headache. Read about Sumatran and asked my doctor. He prescribed it about 2 years ago. It's been a miracle for me.
Completely gets rid of the headache within 15 to 20 minutes. No side effects of any kind. 
To those who have experienced side effects I might suggest taking a half or even a quarter dose. I was prescribed 20 mg and I usually cut them in half and 10 mg works great for me. If 10 mg is an effective dose, at least for some people as I can attest, then I can only imagine what taking 10 times the dose for your body or system might do, as I'm reading some people here were prescribed 50 or even 100 mg.
Hope this helps.",10
"December 26, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,Zecuity (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I am a long time sufferer of frequent (chronic) migraines, up to 15+ a month. I have used sumatriptan since it became available, both in pill form and self-injection. Yesterday I tried the new patch Zecuity for the first time (and likely the last). The actual cost per patch is about $300.00. The packaging is ridiculous: a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about 15 pounds. It contained a large, thick styrofoam container, six special, red PureTemp Bricks, designed to keep the drug at room temperature (it must be kept between 68 it 77 degrees Fahrenheit–NOT refrigerated), and a box of four patches. The patches themselves contain the medication, but also the release/delivery system which includes a computer chip, the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery (four hours–then the light turns off and patch can be removed) and two lithium-manganese dioxide batteries (perchlorate material), which are considered TOXIC WASTE by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash. Instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly (and legally) dispose of the used patches. The above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it. But, as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you, the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like you’d try practically anything. So, hey, even though this is the same drug, maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for. Personally, sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never relieved’ them. It may for some, but not for me. Other than the powerful narcotics I take for other chronic pain, it’s the only other thing that helps at all. Of course, there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons, so I can only use it for my worst migraines. The limit on the patches: no more than four per month. So, okay, I decide to give them a try. I followed all of the (somewhat detailed and involved) instructions and activate it, apply it, and push the start button and the little red light comes on. Within a few minutes, I start to feel a tingling, itchy, burning sensation, though not too bad and certainly not unbearable, or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine. Within about five minutes, the gel (I assume the medication), starts to ooze out the sides of the patch, making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off. Okay, the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape. So I use medical tape. All around the entire patch I use medical tape. Five minutes later, even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel, so I apply even more tape, a lot of tape. I am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body. I also only feel, very slightly, any effect of the sumatriptan. I felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on, as well as red, irritated, itchy, rashy skin upon removal. Oh yeah, and now what the heck do I do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste? Are most users really going to properly dispose of these things? As far a headache relief, obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body, to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible. Another consideration: my health insurance required Prior Approval to cover the patches, part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan (pill, self-injection, intranasal spray) were inadequate and that I required the patches. When I found that out, I refused and told my doctor to do the same. I had little faith that a 4-hour patch of the same drug would work better than a 5 second injection, and I did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections. The drug company provided the one month free trial (four patches), so I agreed to try them. Several years ago, I remember how happy I was when Imetrix finally went generic and I was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper. It saved me (and my insurance company) a lot of money. I don’t really want to give that up either. So, I suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective, especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the self-injections. For me however, considering all of the factors above, I think I’ll stick with the injectable (pun intended), and sometimes the pills, as I don’t like to carry the auto-injections around in my purse (I already have to carry an epipen with me…). I wish the best to other migraine sufferers; perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek. For me however, they are not the answer.",3
"March 28, 2014",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"First month prescription for 20, 50mg tablets. If I take at the first sign of headache goes away about 30 min. If wait to take tablet takes up two hours for the pain to stop. Since I have daily migraines tried waiting to save tablets, concerned run out of 50mg tablets prior to refill date. The Imitrex has been God sent for me. I have had migraines since my teens now in my sixities. Migranies only health probem I have. Plan to call my doctor let know how well Imitrex works for me and see if 30 day prescription or stronger prescription is what I need. From other reviews appears some users go days between headaches, that would be more than I ever expected after all these years.",10
"July 30, 2017",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I'am 40 years old, and I have been suffering from chronic migraine since the age of 9  no medication has worked like Imitrex or sumatropan.  I take the pill when I have migraine pain, and literally it takes about 35 to 40 minutes and WALLA! migraine GONE! YES

"July 15, 2014",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have suffered from migraines all my life and I am now 57. I was prescribed Imitrex at age 39 and the first dose of 50mg gave me a tightness in my throat but it stopped the migraine. I suffered with them every day. I finally figured out that MSG in food was the biggest cause of the migraine. MSG is disguised by many names but I have eliminated a lot of food and with the help of Imitrex, I can live an almost normal life without a migraine. Imitrex sometimes makes me sleep a lot and other times I sleep for about 30 minutes and I'm fine. I praise the makers of Imitrex because nothing else would completely take the pain away!",10
"September 16, 2019",,For Migraine:,"I got my first migraine when I was 6. I suffered so badly when I got one (which was often). Dizziness, vomiting and aura. Nothing helped, they tried everything. As I got older I learned to take Advil right an the onset of symptoms and that usually helped a little. After my daughter was born the migraines returned with a vengeance. I finally couldn’t take the pain any longer and sought out a neurologist. He prescribed Sumatriptan 100mg and it has literally changed my life. I take it and rest for about a hour with my eyes closed and it goes away every time. Sometimes if it’s bad I also use a ice pack. I would recommend this to any migraine sufferer. If you have migraines and won’t take this medication because of side effects I can tell you I had none. It’s a miracle drug.",10
"June 26, 2013",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I completely rely on Imitrex. Once I had this the day-long headaches are gone. I now know that what I used to call ""sinus headaches"" were migraines I had since a teenager, though not bad until into my 40s. My side effects are a little sleepiness and maybe some tiredness, but nothing compared to the debilitation of a migraine. However I am much more aggressive with eliminating triggers, particularly MSG and processed foods, and this helps. My better diet has reduced my need for Imitrex down to 2-3 times a month.",9
"October 8, 2018",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I only use this when I am incapacitated from migraine pain (I get it behind my left eye and can’t open it, have a hard time walking/talking, and end up vomiting). It relieves the physical pain and I am able to see, walk, and talk,  but I am still pretty much down for the count. It says you can take it every 2 hours, but MAN, 1 dose and I feel it for the rest of the day. I get very drowsy, my eyes get droopy, and it feels like I’m walking underwater...or through thick honey. Everything feels so heavy. My speech is slower. I get waves of nausea. Once I take it, I’m home for the day— no way would I feel comfortable driving. 
The side effects can be tough for sure, but I will take them over the bad migraine pain any day. I am always thankful I took it, even if I have to be confined to the couch for 4-6 hours.",9
"November 28, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"this medication will take a migraine away in 20 minutes.  If you have work that day or are trying to get to sleep this in invaluable to me once or twice a month. It stops the pounding quickly, especially accompanying a hot bath.",10
"June 16, 2013",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Migraines have become my worst enemy over the past 4-5 years. Thank goodness for Imitrex. I started with the pills, then the nasal spray and have worked my way up to the shots (plus nausea medicines).  The pills had the least side effects.  The spray was vile tasting, but fast acting and I could take it while working.  When my headaches worsened, they added botox and upgraded me to the injected version. I needed something that acted FAST so I could stay in the classroom.  The down side to the injection is the head rush, change of hear rate, and the flushing feeling.  When I inject I have about 15-30 BAD minutes, then I kind of restabilize and about an hour later I usually feel better and capable of continuing to teach.",8
"October 18, 2019",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I almost always get migraines around my period or times of extreme stress. I was getting a migraine that began as nausea, hot flashes, dizziness and weakness the entire day. That night the pain started so I took 25 mg imitrex in 90 min the pain was gone. I felt some pressure where the pain had been and couldn’t lay on that side. A week later I feel another migraine come on and I wasn’t sure it was a migraine until the nausea came. Took imitrex again and the pain went away after 2 hours but then I got super drowsy and fell asleep and woke up an hour later shaky and anxious. I had not had a good nights sleep the day before so those symptoms may be attributed to lack of sleep but they went away after a few hours. I did try imitrex in the middle of a migraine with nausea, blurry vision, severe pain and it didn’t  help. I was discouraged and did not take a second dose that time. I suggest taking imitrex as soon as you feel pain",9

I am sensitive to gluten of all kinds, if I ingest some, I WILL get nasal stuffiness that will lead to a migraine or cluster headaches. Imitrex works in 45 mins, sometimes sleep is needed to take it away. Sometimes I get migraines for a week or so. Sometimes I take it as a last resort, after trying allergy meds, Tylenol or Valium. But Imitrex works for me. I eat very healthy, no breads of any kind, no gluten, very little sugar. I read all labels, eat mostly veges and meat, mostly organic, I'm getting better at that. ",10

Now in my mid-30's, I finally happened upon a physician (at a CareNow of all places) who actually listened to me as I told him of the nightmare I face at least three times a day, every day, for months on end, and prescribed Imitrex for me.  If taken at the very first sign of an attack, these little beauties (I take the oral) can save you 30 minutes to several hours of unimaginable pain.  I cannot recommend enough that my fellow cluster headache sufferers ask their doctor about considering Imitrex.  While there's no cure, this is the closest thing I've found so far that at least makes living with these headaches bearable",9

I have not reached the vomiting stage of a migraine in years thanks to other medications. Imitrex did nothing to stop the progression of my migraine. I had to leave work in the middle of the afternoon, feeling as if I would vomit at my desk, in the hallway, in the elevator, walking to the parking garage, the entire way. Aleve works better than this stuff, and Aleve only keeps nausea at bay, but does not cure migraines for me.",1

No over the counter medication ever made any difference in the pain at all.  5 years ago I was prescribed Imitrex and it has literally changed my life.  It normally takes an hour or two for it to kick in for me, but when it does, it completely takes my headache away.  I have never had any side effects either.",10

Once a month, 36 hours or so, can't even lay on my head migraines.  Just suffered through.  Tried  Imitrex last December and feel like I've been freed from bondage.  I don't get a high or sleepy sensation, just relief, especially when taken with 2 Advil.  I do not not have I ever uses prescription, pain meds. Seldom use even any NSAIDs.  I was not interested in pain meds so this was a great option and a miracle.  I can even take 2 without side effects.  Sorry to those who have poor outcomes.  FYI- I was discussing it today with a colleague and she said she felt high and loopy.  I was stunned.  Now in reading this, I see some people do react that way.  So I guess I would say, take half, at home with someone around.  Then make a choice from that result.  Good luck!",10
"May 29, 2015",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Saved my life.   Nothing else worked.   Other drugs intensified the headache.

"January 22, 2012",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I hated my experience with Imitrex.  It made my chest feel strange, heart beat increase and I felt very anxious while on it.  I guess it shortened the duration of my headache, but I became very worried and preoccupied by its side effects.",3

To humour my body, I'd take paracetamol, ibuprofen, cocodamol, knowing they would not even touch the sides of these monstrous head pains. Nothing besides my daith piercing  (a piercing that is located in the innermost fold of your ear) has worked. Until now. Enter Sumatriptan! It's bizarre the way it works; I can feel the blood vessels in my head contracting immediately, and then I feel a pained pressure at the top of my nose. It all seems to pulsate for about an hour, after which my migraine has gone!! I take anti-sickness at the same time, to counter the feelings of nausea and it does work. Although, for plenty o'hours afterwards I feel kind of odd; a bit floaty, a little bit dizzy, and the pressure in my nose is still there, but I think I prefer those short-lived symptoms to the three days of awfulness I'd been having until now. Within 12 hours, all my symptoms seems to have gone.",9
"September 29, 2019",,For Migraine:,"I had a migraine so bad that I was vomiting and kept awake for days with pain, so I went to the ER. They prescribed me 50 mg Sumatriptan tablets. I’ve been using them for almost a year, and I’ve had really great success! The best method I have found is to take a pill, lay down in a dark room for an hour and hopefully sleep, and when you get up, your migraine will barely be there anymore. Sometimes it takes the migraine completely away on lucky days, but most of the time it brings the pain down from an 8 or 9 to like a 1 or 2, I’ll still have the residue of a migraine but it’s ignorable. The only side effect I have noticed is some minor nerve pain/tension on my scalp and face. So if I touch my face or brush my hair the nerves there are overly sensitive. It’s minor, ignorable, and totally worth it. Really grateful for this pill and would recommend",9
"December 11, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"AWFUL. Taking the 50mg and 100mg gave me HORRIBLE side effects.

 the pain was horrific, nausea, vomiting and cried like a baby.
Finally went to emergency room and they gave me Imitrex. .. Within 30 minutes headache was gone. I was very sleepy but I don't know if that's a side effect or just from not sleeping the prior 3 days.",10

I've had 'vascular' migraines since I was 13. I'm 35 today. I take Excedrin migraine for my headaches. I take Imitrex for my migraines. Used to be hard to tell the difference. I understand now the difference. But before I found Imitrex, I took all kinds of 'prevention' meds. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, Zoloft, more than I can remember. Never prevented a darn thing. Just ended up with side effects from those. As a teen, that meant acne and weight gain. Aka, hell. 
It's been years now since I've found Imitrex. And like many, I was worried about trying it. But there came a day I couldn't NOT try it. 20 minutes later, I kicked myself for waiting.",10

My Dr. prescribed the 100 mg Sumatriptan pills (which I cut in half) since half a pill seems to knock out the migraine.  But after being on this medication a year, I am now experiencing terrible side effects.  I'm surprised it took a year for side effects to appear.  The worst feeling is how my throat and neck feel...as if someone is slightly choking me with their hands.  My neck is stiff and I have to pee every half hour and I get these hot flashes (maybe due to the menopause).  What really has me baffled is I haven't taken any sumatriptan in 4 days and I'm still feeling the same side effects...How long are they supposed to last?",5
"December 31, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,"I always got Dr. Reddy's 50 mg sumatriptan with each pill wrapped individually in paper/tinfoil/sealed.  I got a prescription in a bottle with the pills inside, loose.  When I take those (in the bottle), I get a terrible back pain going down my spine and different areas of my back, neck, and throat.  It is so bad that I have to give myself a massage with a hand-held massage machine over the painful areas.  It lasts about 20 minutes.  My migraine does go away, but I have never had this pain after taking the pills in the bottle.  It is a mystery??",6

Imitrex works almost always to eliminate the migraine. Every once in awhile I wait too long and have to take two. I have no side effects to speak of which is crazy to me because I can't even use herbal remedies without experiencing weird side effects. I'm thankful for the scientists who created this drug. I always have it with me just in case and it keeps me from being out for the count with my two little girls.",9

I also have a grade-school daughter and if I have a migraine, believe me, the entire family suffers. The pain from a migraine can last 3 days for me so having something that will knock it out in a matter of minutes is in my eyes, miraculous. It doesn't ALWAYS work, especially if I have cluster headaches, but 90% of the time, it works for me on one dose. If the first dose doesn't work, I take another and that usually just completely wipes it out. ",10

This is horrible when you are at work as many of you know.  ,8

-mild heartburn-like feeling during the first 1-2 hours after taking it.
-moderate heaviness/tightness in my jaw that lasted just about 12 hours after taking.
-some drowsiness
-some mild neck pain (which could have been the migraine)
-a tightness/tingling (very mild) in my forearms.

I’m talking, tingling fingers, trying to talk but my brain can’t find my words, PAIN that lasts at least 2 days with 1-2 of my brain not working. I tried Fioricet and it didn’t work. Magnesium aspartate supplements helped a ton with the tension and blindness headaches.  Finally my dr gave me this and OH MY GOSH 30 mins later I felt so much better, by an hour it was gone!! I still feel like my brain is dulled for several hours but even though I can no longer feel the headache, it’s still there messing stuff up. On occasion I have to take two. If I let the pain get really bad before I take it, it takes longer to work. I can usually count on it being gone for 6-20 hours before I need to take again. I love it.

I tried every over the counter medication, including Excedrin, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen.  I recently started taking Imitrex.   It's amazing.  It does take a while to kick in, probably about an hour to 2.  The pain goes away within about 20 minutes but I still have a pressure like feeling until about an hour or two later.  It also has really helped my depression, maybe because of the serotonin element in the medication.  It doesn't make me tired or dizzy luckily.  I do feel relaxed, but not in a bad way.  I really love it.",9

I recently had a migraine at work and decided to try a imitrex my doctor prescribed me. I was nervous to try it but am so happy I did. I waited a few minutes of having the migraine before I took it but it relieved me of my migraine within 30 minutes. I did experience some effects like muscle stiffness in my neck, tightness in my face and a burning feeling in my nose and forehead for about a hour but I'll take that any day over a migraine.",9

Imitrex works at least 95% of the time, but maybe 10% of those times, the headache recurs and I have to take another one (which almost never happened with Relpax). My side effects are weird but not debilitating: sense of pressure in head, neck, chest, shoulders, arms; tingling in face; dry burning eyes; skin sensitivity to hot/cold; taste sensitivity to spicy/sour; lack of appetite; sweat; thirst; diuretic. A bit sluggish and sometimes drowsy, but not truly fatigued. Almost never nauseous; never dizzy. A couple of hours later, I often feel mild muscle soreness.

Within a few minutes I can feel the medicine rushing through my head. It feels very heavy and leaves me with a dizzy sensation. I usually need about an hour of sleep and then the migraine is gone completely. I suffer about three migraines a week and only need a second dose about once a month. Pretty effective if you ask me! I have noticed that if I am feeling nauseous already, the medicine intensifies this. I found that taking a sublingual anti nausea medicine a few minutes before the injection greatly reduces this side effect.",10
"October 31, 2016",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I have suffered from migraine for many years. Before I started using Imitrex (about 15 years ago) some migraines would affect me for days. I missed out on so much back then. Imitrex changed that. I normally can take one dose and get complete relief in an hour. The only side effect that I have ever suffered is sleepiness but it's not so severe that I can't take Imitrex while working if a migraine strikes. This medication has been a life saver for me and changed my quality of life.,10
"August 12, 2019",,For Cluster Headaches:,"I go to a headache clinic to deal with my intense cluster/migraine headache bouts.  My doctor asked me to try sumatriptan as an option for dealing with the worst headaches as soon as I feel them come on.  I liked the idea of having something to take only during headache periods, as opposed to daily.  I had the opportunity to give it a shot this weekend and... woah.

Sumatriptan does NOT agree with my system.  Shortly after taking it, my scalp at the crown of my head felt like it was on fire.  So painful.  The back of my neck also seized up and I had to lie down, even though it was impossible to get comfortable.  The good thing is that this medication has a short half-life (two hours), so my discomfort, though intense, was short-lived.  Did my headache fade away?  Absolutely, but the discomfort it was swapped out for was arguably worse and so scary.  I'm returning the remainder of this prescription to the pharmacy for disposal.",1

"January 8, 2012",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"At first, I thought it was great- no headache. Then, the more frequently I used the medication to treat my migraines, the more debilitating side-effects I began to experience. I could first mitigate the burning/pain and weakness in my head, neck and jaw and the general feeling of malaise/fatigue by the administration of Naproxen or Ibuprofen prior to the Imitrex, but then, even that ceased to be effective. I finally quit after experiencing total body weakness, a more severe burning/pain in my upper extremeties than ever before (accompanied by fluctuating hot/cold sensations everywhere else), irregular heartbeat and irregular breathing after administration.

I tend to have extreme nausea and vomiting with my severe headaches, so I also use the nasal spay form (depending on how nauseated I am) They both work well if taken early in the migraine. I did however have severe reaction the first 2-3 times taking it (nausea, vomiting, abdominal upset) but I forced myself to take it again. Now my experience is ""head tightening"" which I see can be common with this drug and after about 15  minutes of this, I feel a ""loosening"" and finally relief.

The pain was 9/10 and now 2/10 so I just wished the first Dr. had recommended this then, so I didn't have to go through agony for 4 more days but hey, I guess no one knows what strength is needed without going through the motions.",9

Took 10 minutes to stop a bad migraine (8 on a 10 scale) and another 10 minutes to be back to functional. Was a bit disoriented and dizzy for that first 20 minutes. Relpax is my typical drug of choice nowadays but it doesn't stop the bad ones. It only stops the ones that I catch right away. But this Sumavel is my new knight in shining armor.

I average one migraine every 2-3 months, usually w/changes in weather and/or interrupted or reduced sleep. If I recognize the aura phase (usually smells, sometimes halos or light streaks/trails), and take Imitrex within the first couple of hours, it can completely ward off the pain. If I don't catch it in the aura and take it after actual pain hits, it's still helpful but I will still be subject to 2-3 days pain and need recurring doses, plus I supplement Imitrex with naproxen and caffeine.

"May 25, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,Imatrex has helped me 100% with my cluster headaches. Certain foods trigger these painful headaches and even though I know most of the triggers and even though I try to avoid them its impossible to eat and not have at least one or two of these triggers in my food. My doctor tried me on several pain meds for these headaches but nothing worked. The headaches got so bad I was literally pulling my hair out and was thinking about suicide. Then my doctor gave me Imatrex. As long as I know I have access to Imatrex I am fine. I finally went to a wonderful neurologist who has been very patient in trying other meds to work with the Imatrex. I do take the generic of Imatrex.,10
"September 6, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"Prescribed this because I have allergy to other type of pain medicine.  Took one  50mg, worst experience ever!  I had hot flashes with sweat, my face and nose felt like it was burning, aching body. I felt high and not in a good way.  Trapped at work, scared to even drive. Migraine is still here with the side effects.  Should have done homework first before trusting this was just another pain med.  NEVER AGAIN!",1
"May 25, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"I was prescribed this type of sumatriptan succinate 50 mg by Dr. Reddy Pharmaceuticals company , I felt like I was poisoned. I was throwing up, jaw tight and hurt, heart racing, I was sweating, feeling nausea. It was a horrible feeling. I have had sumatriptan before and I have never had such reaction.",1
"August 6, 2017",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"When I moved to Indiana I started getting migraines . My doctor prescribed imitrex 25 mg which worked beautifully as long as I took it when the migraine started. Though it still doesn't always work and I take another dose 2 hours after the 1st dose. I developed tolerance to it and now need to take 50 mg. Fortunately my migraines have slowed down to a dull roar as I've figured out my triggers. Imitrex has some annoying but mostly tolerable side effects that dissipate with use, such as feeling physically fatigued, feeling kind of drugged, trouble thinking clearly, increased blood pressure/heart rate, sometimes I feel shaky.",8
"March 13, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"God bless Imitrex. I can take the injection either at the start of a migraine or right in the middle of it and it works like a charm each time. I don't know what I would do without it. My migraines were crippling but thanks to Imitrex, I have my life back.",10
"June 14, 2016",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,I've suffered from cluster headaches since I was 14 years old I'm 35 now. My last headache was in 2013 shortly after my mother passed. I thought I had out grown the headaches but May of 2016 here I go again going into my second month of having them everyday. I've tried imitrex you name it sometimes painkillers work sometimes they don't but like many other cluster headaches suffers Ive been threw hell.I don't know what do I'm a truck driver and it makes it hard to do my job even after the headache have gone. I just wanted to share my experience,
"August 23, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,This medication has been an absolute life saver for me. I've not experienced any side effects from using it. It takes an hour to kick in but works amazingly. I cannot recommend it enough. I have been using the medication for 10 years and suffer from migraines a few times per month.,10
"August 24, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,The worst experience ever I had a bad migraine took sumatriptan as prescribed from my doctor.  I had  the worst ever side effects I had stiff neck pain all over my body short of breath my chest felt tight it took my migraine away but was it all worth the pain I got from taking this pill. Nope never again - I will stick to Excederin,1
"July 23, 2020",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"I use Imitrex to treat my cluster headaches I have episodic clusters. Usually get them once a year for a month or more. I get two to three attacks a day during the cycle. I use Imitrex injections and pills,  the injections get rid of  the pain in about 10 minutes and the Imitrex pills take about about thirty minutes to work . Don’t know what I would do without them",10
"August 22, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"Everyone is different. I react badly to many drugs but sumatriptan - to my total surprise- has so far helped with my migraines with very few side effects. The pain doesn't respond to anything else. I've tried aspirin paracetamol, ibuprofen and even tramadol. I've tried running, singing, rehydration salts, hot packs, cold packs, nasal sprays and I don't know what else. When the migraines got to the point that I couldn't sleep them off - they are actually worse now after sleep - I asked the doc for help and she prescribed sumatriptan 50mg and it's like a miracle drug. The pain goes away after about an hour. I feel a bit manic and a bit dizzy after taking it but I feel dizzy and angry with the migraines anyway so that's a side effect I'm ok with at the moment. Note I've only been using it a couple of months and plan for this to be temporary while I investigate whether lifestyle changes will help me manage my headaches without drugs.",9
"December 14, 2020",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"sumatriptan works really well for me. The pain relievers didn’t always work for me  and I used to spend a few days in bed not being able to do anything- but Sumatriptan always worked so far, so I’m happy with it. I do feel quite hazy and sleepy after taking a pill, but the migraine goes away quickly and it doesn’t come back. I take it rarely, only around once a month and only for migraines.",10
"July 1, 2018",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This drug will get rid of my migraine about 70% of the time, but I only use it when nothing else works because the side effects are almost as bad as the migraine itself. 

It makes my skin feel prickly and tight, and my throat feels tight and like I can't swallow. It gives me such intense nausea that I often don't speak when I take it because I feel like if I open my mouth, I'll throw up. From trial and error, the nausea seems to abate if I take it with food, but if I forget to take it with food I have to force myself to eat through the nausea. My brain also feels really foggy and basic actions are difficult when I take it.

I'm glad there are people who don't react like this, but I am definitely asking to be switched to a different medication.",3
"November 1, 2012",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This medicine kept the migraine from becoming full blown.  It made me sleepy and out of sorts, but this is better than an agonizing migraine.  I took it as soon as I saw the visual effect and within 30 min my vision was back to normal.  However, I still had a mild migraine with very little nausea.  Imitrex made me tired and my body felt heavy. It also made my tongue feel swollen, but it wasn't. But I'd take this over a full blown migraine any day! It seemed to fast forward the headache rather than it being debilitating like last time. I still lay around all day though.",7
"August 17, 2013",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"The injection feels like a rubber band snapped on your skin. I recommend the abdomen over the thigh, much more comfortable. I only bleed slightly, and the site only bruised once. The triptan effect is fast and intense, you feel that rush of the migraine about to go away. It makes me sleepy, as sumatriptan always has, and I nap for less than 1/2 hour, then I am PAIN FREE. The nice thing is the triptan effect goes away as rapidly as it comes on, which is far better than the lingering ""yuck"" feeling with oral triptans.  Not just pain reduction, not a lessening of the migraine - it is gone. It has reduced my sick and late days due to migraine from 9 days in 2012 to ZERO so far in 2013. Will never go without it again.",10
"August 19, 2016",,For Cluster Headaches:,"Very bad experience/reaction with only half a dose!  1) Did not take away headache. 2) Increase in pain, heavy weight feeling on my chest, shortness of breath, cold sweats.  This med was a nightmare for me!  I felt immediate pain and pressure in head, neck and shoulders.  The worst however was feeling like a one hundred pound weight on my chest.  Additionally, nausea and cold sweats and feeling like I was in big trouble (practically and ER trip)!  Beware of this med, it may not be for everyone!  Will go back to 3 advil and a coke or my fiorocet.  Cure is worse than the disease in this case for me!",1
"April 28, 2013",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"I've just started taking Imitrex, the first time I took it, I thought I was getting lock jaw. I was quite worried. I took it again the next day though because it did take care of my headache. Since the first time I took it, the side effects have been minor. Hopefully it stays this way.",8
"May 5, 2015",,For Migraine:,This medication has changed my life. I have had migraine since I was age 17. My son lost a lot of time and attention from me because I used to be debilated for from early morning until about 7 pm. Only when my doctor prescribed Sumatriptan for me about 6 years ago I have got back quality of life. I thank from the bottom of my heart whoever invented this medication. Thankfully in UK we have the National Health Service which means I don't have to pay for the medication. I probably would find it hard to afford otherwise. I worry about all the people around the world who suffer migraine and do not have access to Sumatriptan. Forget all the wealth. Health is the true wealth for me. Thank you Sumatriptan.,10
"April 24, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,I have suffered from cluster headaches for over 15 years and have tried almost everything offered by hospitals and over the counter. I recently was given Imitrex in a nasal spray by my doctor and as long as your nasal passage is clear I have found that about five to ten minutes after you taste it in your throat the headaches go away. It is the best medicine I have ever come across for cluster headaches and my days and nights are much better because of it.,10
"July 21, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,This is a miracle for migraines. Works within 5 minutes and migraine GONE. You will have energy and get on with your day. I am 43 yrs old and have suffered with migraines since teen. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO YOUR DR AND ASK FOR THIS MEDICINE. SUFFER NO MORE.,10
"March 18, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex does the trick of getting rid of my migraine every time, but the side effects are a little rough.  I feel as though my neck and chest are tightening and achy, but if I go to sleep about 10 minutes after taking Imitrex. I miss the side effects happening to me, and just wake up feeling better.",7
"June 1, 2020",,For Migraine:,"Sumatriptan, when taken as early as possible (thankfully I can almost predict a migraine to the day because they are 1-3 days before my period) get rid of the pain so well. I don't even take anything else alongside it which I believe you can. I get pain free inside 40 minutes with a little rest, which is amazing when I know how brutal the migraines can be. A small side effect is a tight feeling in the throat area but it's so mild and the feeling only lasts an hour or two. I know sumatriptan is not ideal for everyone, the possible side effects can be off-putting, but as an otherwise fit and healthy lady I recommend it to similar people. I only have 1 or two migraines a month (the second seems to be an ovulation migraine caused by the sudden rise in hormones, again predictable with a regular menstrual cycle). I'm very lucky to only need one or two Sumatran tablets a month, 2 weeks apart. I'm not sure I would want to be taking lots of these a month, but for my needs they are a god send!",9
"December 10, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I suffered from migraines since I was 10 and am now 38.  Mine are triggered by stress and monthly hormone fluctuations. I first tried Imitrex when I was 21 and it made me so dizzy I couldn't stand. Recently I tried it again when I was having a migraine at work and it was so bad I went to the emergency room afraid I was having a stroke. I used to take OTC meds and isolate myself in a dark quiet room.  My migraines kept me from enjoying important events with my children. This drug has been life changing. I have experienced some sleepiness as a side effect but nothing that makes me non-functional.,9
"October 24, 2011",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been a migraine sufferer since 1993 as the years went by they got worse where over the counter medicines didn't help. In 1996 I was diagnosed with migraines by a neurologist after going through test after test to rule out other medical problems. Believe me I actually had ask the doctor is it possible to cut that piece of brain out. Thats how severe they are. He prescribed several different kinds of migraine medicines and none worked for me until he gave me Imitrex. This is actually a miracle pill, yes the side effects are horrible and the migraine gets worse before it gets better, but once it's gone you are back to your normal life like you never had an episode. I don't leave home without it.",
"April 25, 2019",,For Migraine:,"First migraine I was 12.  Prophylactic  treatment in my 20s slowed my heart rate too much. Was on beta blockers through pregnancies due to aura and Dr’s concern of stroke. Long, bad migraine history. 

Was told pain should end after 40s. At 50 it’s worse and more frequent. Woke today to the 3rd day of a massive one. Huge amounts of pseudophedrine and ibuprofen only  pushed it back enough to function.  By lunch I was done. Went to dr and they prescribed 50 mg tabs. 

 Sumatriptan is a miracle medicine! Within 10 mins I could feel it back off. Within 30 mins the hangover was setting in. My words were jumbled and I felt giddy. (This always happens when my migraines start to lift, so it wasn’t medicine side effect.) An hour later I was totally headache free. I can’t remember the last time this was true!  Nine hours later I still feel good. Scared about tomorrow, but have a pill to take if needed.  No side effects except feeling a little speedy for a short while. My only complaint is that I waited so long to try.",10
"April 12, 2017",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I avoid taking Imitrex if I can because I experience so many side effects from it. I get jaw and shoulder pain/stiffness, pain in the back of my neck and scalp, headaches, drowsiness and I just generally feel weird and awful after taking it. After 2 hours or so, my migraine goes away and the awful-ness of the Imitrex lessens so that is why I do take it occasionally. Every time I take it, I'm reminded of how badly I need to find something else.",6
"September 16, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"I've been having migraines so the doc put me on 25 mg of Imitrex. It makes you very tired and drowsy so I wouldn't suggest taking it at work or when driving. It got rid of the migraine but had horrible side effects. I took it Saturday at noon and here it is Monday morning and I still feel panicky, nauseous, very tired and feel like I'm having a panic attack. I won't be taking it again.",2
"May 18, 2017",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I took Maxalt for years, it knocked me out completely. Horrible. if you have a job. I started taking Imitrex and in 15 minutes my migraine disappeared! Amazing! I didn't get any of the side effects that everyone talks about. I was fine! And it didn't bother my stomach either!",
"September 6, 2016",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex works wellto rid me of my migraines a few hours after I have taken it, but the side effects for me are pretty bad. It makes me feel really weird and it seems like my whole body is achy and muscles are burning. Of course, the side effects that I get from this medicine is nothing compared to a full blown migraine hence why I've been taking it all these years. I will be talking with my doctor at my next visit though about switching medicines because I'm sick of feeling like crap after taking it.",7
"September 24, 2019",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Migraine:,"I am from the UK and have suffered with migraines for years and years. Up to a point I'm getting 15-20 a month. Some days worse than others. I've tried diff docs and nothing they prescribed to me seem to work. Pain killers were a no-go as didn't even touch the sides. My doctor gave me Sumatriptan around 2 years ago. I literally cannot live without this. 
The sensation is amazing when it kicks in around 10-30 mins after taking it. My throat goes a little tight, my neck starts to ache, and 1 side of my body goes a little numb. You have about 10 minutes of intense side effects, but when you have a migraine for the last 3 days its a god send. This medication works for me and is the best thing to get rid of an ongoing migraine. Now I can get on with my day!",10
"September 28, 2020",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Migraine:,"21yo male at time of writing. Been having migraines for the past 5 years, at worst once or twice a month. 2 years back I started taking sumatriptan on doctor's advice, and it works magic. Tends to make me drowsy and a bit dizzy/light-headed for 6-8 hours, but the pain and light/sound-sensitivity dissipates within 30min. The only advice I'd give is to NOT take them and go back to sleep, my body enters some form of giga-sleep where it refuses to wake up at anything less than vigorous physical shaking. Might be just me though. Definitely recommend the med otherwise.",9
"September 6, 2019",,For Migraine:,"** BE WARY*
I am 22 and started getting migraines in high school. I first get visual aura, I  immediately take 100mg of sumatriptan. I have probably taken this medicine 6 times and I will say it is not worth it. The medicine was ok at first, but then I started to get intense numbness tingling in my left hand, it travels through my fingers and up my arm. It would subside after 5 mins, then my tongue and roof of mouth go numb. My neck aches horribly, my jaw is unbearably sore and weak. I must rest in bed the remainder of the day at the least after taking this.  The side effects have become unbearable for me. It reduced my visual aura but I feel like I am dying because of the side affects which puts me in a panic. I am not a sensitive person so believe me, this stuff is scary. My neurologist told me these are signs of a stroke and the meds are not fitting for me. He said this drug restricts blood flow & I needed the opposite.  He prescribed me Fiorcit- havent used yet but has good reviews",2
"September 20, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Tried 50mg of imitrex, and in addition to the body aches and burning most describe, my migraine shifted to neck/headache.  My pain level was turned up to 11.  It's a horrible drug when one would rather a mograine",
"February 9, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Cluster Headaches:,"I've had cluster headaches for about 14 years now, and haven't found any helpful meds until now. Sumatriptan has been extremely helpful for me this cluster period. I use the tablets so it takes about 30 minutes to feel the effects. I take it as soon as I start to feel tension in the head and neck, with the slight onset of a headache. By the time it starts to work, the attack is almost in full force, but once it kicks in the pain immediately subsides and begins to quickly go away. It saves me at least a good hour of the intense, tortuous pain - which also saves me a lot of the side effects of the attacks such as nausea and fatigue. I've found little to no side effects along with the drug, so I'm almost immediately able to function afterwards",8
"January 24, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,"I have migraines that are usually triggered by hormonal changes around my menstrual cycle. I have been taking this medication for roughly 10 years now. My migraines become so bad I shake, vomit, and otherwise feel like I am dying.  Sumatriptan has been a godsend for me, I take the pill form and 50mg is all I usually need. It takes around 45 minutes to an hour to kick in were I feel I can function again and I feel completely normal by 2 hours. I request Dr. Ready brand, I have had some brands not work as well. Hence the rating of 9/10 for me due to inconsistent effectiveness with generic brands. It does make me a little lightheaded and whole body fatigued for the first hour but that is nothing compared to suffering through a migraine!!!",9
"August 12, 2019",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"I had my first migraine at age 11.  I didn't know that was what it was, but they became more frequent as I got older.  I took Excedrin for years which would usually only work if I took it right at the beginning of the migraine.  Sometimes it didn't work.  When I was in my late 40's, suddenly the Excedrin stopped working altogether, and I began having occasional auras.  I was taking Excedrin and alternating with Ibuprofen with no success.  My migraines were lasting 4-5 days.  I finally went to the doctor when I began feeling nausea (which I had never had before).  He prescribed Sumatriptan, and it was magic!  It has worked so well for me.  I have very few side effects.  In order to take as little as possible I usually try Excedrin first which does help sometimes.  However, if it doesn't, I will take Sumatriptan, and that always takes care of it.  I am a happy camper!",9
"June 25, 2013",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,This medication works for me. I did have slight chest discomfort first few times using it. No longer experience it. Sometimes it makes me feel tired but I continue on and it goes away.  Headache disappears within 30 mins to 1 hr of taking tablet.  I have been taking Imitrex and sumatriptan for over 25 years and am thankful the neurologist prescribed it.,10
"September 6, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I’ve been taking Imitrex for over 20 years.  My migraines began during my first pregnancy but then continued.  At my worst I was having at least one migraine a week.  My experience is that within 30 minutes to an hour I am relieved IF I eat after taking.  My get sleepy most times and my neck gets very heavy.  Sometimes my whole body feels heavy but that goes away as soon as the relief begins.,10
"August 25, 2015",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been getting migraines off and on since around the age of 16, and am now 25. Most of my migraines are due to my allergies during the spring/summer. But they seem to be even worse during the colder months. This medication works wonders for me. The only thing I seem to notice is a bit of dizziness after the medicene wears off. But I would much rather have a little dizziness rather than being bedridden, light/sound sensitivity, migraine, and nausea/vomiting.",10
"January 8, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I had a horrible reaction to Imitrex, due to a possible drug interaction with Wellbutrin. 
I had gone to the E.R., worried that I might have been having a stroke. It was clearly stated in my chart that I was on Wellbutrin, but they prescribed Imitrex for me at the E.R. anyway, after presenting with what they concluded to be a complex migraine. I took an Imitrex pill when I got home, and almost immediately after taking it, I experienced the most horrendous and oppressive, burning headache.  It felt like the most painful and unbearable sinus headache I had ever experienced. So, I didn't try to take Imitrex again. Then, at my follow up visit with my doctor, he asked me how the Imitrex was working and I told him that I couldn't take it because it actually gave me a worse headache than I had started with. He said, ""oh yeah, Imitrex is known to have a negative interaction with some antidepressants, like Wellbutrin. I wish someone had noticed that when they prescribed it to me.",1
"August 21, 2017",,For Migraine:,"I am 42 yrs old. I started having migraines at age 36 so 6 yrs now. About 2 to 3 a week. These migraines changed my life completely for the worst! Sometimes they were so bad I would have rather died!  All of a sudden I couldn't work. I quit my job at age 36. Spent 1.5 yrs trying 7 or 8 different medicines and other remedies to get rid of or control my migraines and nothing worked  for me until I tried 100mg sumatriptan.  To keep my point short, 100mg sumatriptan has been a miracle drug for me. I just have to make sure I take it immediately when I feel a migraine coming and take it with food - timing is everything with this drug! Take too early it wont work and too late then it will take longer to work.",9
"December 1, 2016",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Been having headaches all of the sudden the entire month of November. Bad headaches! Was actually scared to take imitrex because of side effects but finally took it after 2 days of agony, and it worked!! So happy this worked for me",10

Imitrex was the first medication I was put on. I was excited to start feeling better, but imitrex made me feel awful. I suffer from extreme nausea before, during and after a migraine and it's completely life ruining. I've tried imitrex many times, in hopes of it finally working. Every time I'd take it, I'd get a horrible burning in my throat, and my migraine would worsen. It didn't help nausea, aura, pain or any other migraine symptoms I suffer from.

 I was prescribed Sumatriptan 100mg tablets & OMG, miraculous!!! Take one at the onset of headache & its gone in around 20 minutes. Tightness in shouldes, chest quickly passes.

I did not have to go into my dark room.  I am really impressed and you don't taste the medication going down your throat as much as you do with the solution. Thank you",10
"March 24, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,This medication is by far the best migraine medicine that I have used.

My body and limbs felt extremely heavy, like dead weight, I could barely move. Then the nausea came. I felt so I’ll, like I would certainly vomit. I never did tho. I tried to sleep it off, I napped for about 3 hours with a cold wash cloth on my head. It did not get any better. I decided to try and wake up and maybe try and get some water or electrolytes in my system, that seemed to help a little. My migraine then was just at the back of my head and my forehead, instead of my whole head. My nausea was still there, I tried eating soup. I’m writing this about 7 hours later and my head still hurts but my nausea is gone. Never again will I try this medication.",1

It literally has changed my life, anyone who suffers from migraines knows the feeling of a migraine building knowing that pain is coming and trying to head it off with oral Meds and then failing to stop it. The endless hours of horrific pain. Luckily my insurance covers it, but I'd buy it whatever the cost.",10
"June 24, 2017",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Cluster Headaches:,"After suffering with cluster headaches for two years I was prescribed sumatriptan 100mg tablets which were effective if taken on an empty stomach. They got to work in about 20-30min which saved a good hour or so of debilitating pain, so were great. When the next bout hit I asked about the injections as the tablets didn't always work/work quick enough. Doctor agreed and I got Imigran 6mg. Wow. Just wow. Aborts the headache within a couple of minutes of injection (which is simple and easy). They are a lifesaver and I would recommend anybody who suffers cluster headaches to ask your doctor about it. In the UK they're available on NHS; my doctor was hesitant at first as apparently they cost £25 per 2 injection pack. But they are worth it.",10
"March 31, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"Imitrex is a wonderful drug for us Cluster Heads.  I've not been without one on or about my person for the past 17 years.  I'm sure that all of us cluster suffers only wish that they would work a lot faster (like the injectitons), but I am sooooo thankful for them in any form.  A real ""life saver"".",8
"April 25, 2017",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been using Imitrex 5mg injections for several years as an emergency migraine  abortive. While it did instantly relieve the head pain and nausea, I had to then wait out 30-45 minutes of side effects. Those side effects were: upper jaw pain, and overall body aches (like when you have the flu) such as super sensitive skin, even my hair hurt. But for a long time this was the only option available to me through insurance, and the side effects were more bearable than the migraine. But recently the injection stopped working, and I ended up having to go to the ER. Now I have been given Zomig nasal spray. I have not had a reason to try it yet, but am worried about side effects.",5
"January 25, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"I consider Imitrex to be the geatest medicine in the world, at least as far as my health is concerned. I am never without the auto injector. When a chronic headache comes on, I inject myself, 3 to 4 minutes later ... no pain. My muscles are fatigued and I'm somewhat tired for about 30 minutes, but NO PAIN! ... Yes!",
"April 15, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,Followed the instructions. Two (2) of the shots were defective (Out of 6).  One was harmless and did not fire which only cost me $100 for the non performing shot.  The other did nothing until it fired accidentally into my eye.  Seeking regulatory and legal help.,1
"December 13, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Will not ever touch it again! I suffer migraines so bad that I end up in the hospital almost on a regular basis. Well my doctor finally prescribed imitrex and I swore up and down that I wouldn't take it due to potential side effects, but my head hurt so bad today that I threw in the towel and took one. Mind you, I'm on the 100mg and it has done nothing but ignore my migraine causing it to manifest into a bigger one.",1
"January 7, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"I have been having cluster headaches for 15 years now.  I was just diagnosed 5 years ago, so for the first 10 I was told, ""Oh, its just migraines"", and was given multiple different medicines to prevent migraine, which obviously didn't help.  So now I'm finally taking Verapamil 3 times a day.  Every 2 years or so, my clusters come back, and usually only last about a month, I am currently in my episodal period, and has lasted over 2 months now.  I take Sumatriptan for when I get a Cluster, but insurance only pays for 9 pills a month.   And they work, but 9 a month does not work, because anyone with cluster's, know that you could have 5 or 6 a day.",9
"March 19, 2012",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have suffered from migraines for 32 years, the older I am the worse they become. I have both the Imitrex pills & the shots.  When I am nauseated I must use the shot.  Approx. 1 minute after injection the intense buring in my head & the amplified headache are the worst side effects however NOTHING compared to the migraine.  Usually the migraine is gone in 15 - 30 mins and I sleep it off. There is also the 12 - 24 hour Imitrex hangover from the shot.  Muscles feel as though they are made of jelly, overall wiped out feeling.  The pill does not have the burning effect for me and it takes the full 30 minutes to combat the migraine.  Imitrex is the only medicine which has worked for me consistantly over the years.  I become immune to all other  medicines.",9
"October 28, 2010",,For Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome:,I take sumatriptan for the onset of my migraines and nausea that come along with my CVS. On bad days they help a lot. The only thing is I usually have to take more than one dose and the medication is expensive even with insurance.,7
"March 11, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I'm 3.5 months pregnant and had been suffering from the worst migraine I'd ever experienced for 2 days.  I finally went to urgent care as instructed by my OB.  They gave me an injection of imitrex.  The side effects suck.  I felt dioriented and my head felt heavy.  I was sweating.  After about 20 minutes, the side effects subsided a bit and I was able to go. It is now 2 hours later and I feel 100 times better. My migraine is basically gone.  If you can deal with the side effects, its worth it.",8
"January 5, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex makes me more nauseous than I am with just the headache. My neck and shoulders get very stiff and it takes more than an hour to feel any relief. As others have said however, if I am able to take this medicine and lie down it does wonders. Life just isn't that practical though so I can't use it anymore.",6
"August 13, 2016",,For Migraine:,"I have had migraines for as long as I could remember especially when it's bright, loud noises or when I'm on my phone. I had a really bad migraine and I took a tablet as directed and I felt horrible after. So bad it brought me to tears. The migraine worsened and I felt nauseous and sick. Never will take again.",1
"April 13, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"Injections are expensive...but they are the only thing that I have found that work for my cluster headaches.  Truly a lifesaver.  The burning sensation is ugly, but better than the viciousness ripping of my head to pieces.",9
"May 22, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Lifesaver! This med has helped give me my life back. I occasionally had 3 days of lights off, ice pack, cool & quiet bedroom time for the pain, often to the point of vomiting. I've been on it for years and take the injections with warm & tingly side effects but completely worth it. I crash for an hour with an ice pack & when I get up I feel fantastic. Love ❤",10
"December 26, 2018",,For Migraine:,"Migraines impacted school and work, and honestly I felt hopeless when experiencing them. I would see things that made me scared, feel intense tingling sensations, and nausea. My triggers are so far: dairy, caffeine, neck stiffness, dehydration. When I do get a migraine, I only take 1/3 to 1/4 of the pill. I'm petite frame and sensitive, and taking the full pill knocked me on the floor useless for about 5 hours (feeling very heavy and high/out of it). Side effects I notice are: drowsy, slow, heavy, numbness in throat, sensitivity to hot water, which is mostly noticeable for about 2 hours. Ideally I will take one when I am able to either nap or go to bed for the night, and I wake up feeling great. If I take one during the day I will absolutely avoid driving or operating any machinery (at work).",8
"March 13, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Before Imitrex I had Migraines that would last 2 day. I finally went to emergency to get a shot of Demerol and then sometimes it would not work.
I would be right there with my bowl & sun glass on waiting my turn. I was put on Imitrex when it first came out and the long term effect was not for sure on people. Anything is better than a migraine headache. I started taking the shots and at first it made me feel a little funny for first 2 minute then it cleared up and within 15 minutes my migraine was gone. After using it for a while I developed an immunity to it. I then had to use 2 shots. My doctor at the time had me stop using it. It WAS a great medication for Migraines back then.",10
"June 13, 2017",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Started having debilitating (not able to take my head from under the pillow and nausea/vomiting) migraines after having my daughter.  I get about 4-6 a month, most of them are menstrual migraines, but I was lucky to find imitrex soon after I started having migraines.  I used to take injectable or nasal spray, but have been on 10mg tabs for a few years now. Nothing else but Imetrex works and it works for me every time. I am not a fan of the side effects at all, which are muscle tension mostly in jaw and neck, as well as feeling drained for several hours after. I will take it over the horrible migraines any day though.",10
"January 8, 2013",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I have been on Imitrex for years now and when my Migraine starts Imitrex takes care of it. Only a couple of times I had to take the second pill I'm on 100mg as for side effects I have not had any. My doctor has me on Topamax to help control them and I keep my Imitrex with me when I need it.,10
"July 29, 2013",,For Cluster Headaches:,"I'm 46 yrs old and was diagnosed with cluster headaches in my late 20's. I was prescribed sumatriptan last week due to my new spell which started 2 weeks ago, and the medicine is working great for me. When ones coming on, I take a 50mg pill, and it starts working within minutes. I feel and hear crackling noises in my head, as well as my nasal cavity and eye socket, and miraculously it starts to lift away. In some cases though I had to take a second pill because the first didn't work completely, but within 30 to 45 minutes I'm relaxed and pain free. Since they've taken Cafergot off the market I've been without any medicine at all, trying steroids my neurologist experimented with, which didn't work at all. Sumatriptan is working.",10
"October 24, 2018",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Migraine:,"Sumatriptan has changed the way I live.
I suffer/ed from migraine, sinus, stress and daily headaches for almost 10 years - at their worst they could last up to 3 weeks with no subsidence... I'd literally wake up with and go to bed with 
that cycle all/every day.
I tried everything- oils, supplements, herbal, tracking triggers... nothing worked.
I was miserable and couldn't plan a thing; it was a guarantee that I'd have to cancel.
I reluctantly (but desperately) popped along to the doctor who gave me sumatriptan.
They vary when they kick in... Must depend on what's going on in my body... But usually within an hour. Only rarely do I need more than one on any given day. I've never looked back.
Side effects vary; sensitivity, a bit slower but sometimes nothing at all. 
I have high blood pressure but I swear I couldn't live without them.
Hopefully no long term damage, but they way I see it my life was a prison of pain before anyway.",10
"March 27, 2016",,For Migraine:,"I've been using Sumatriptan for my menstrual migraines for 5 years or so now, I'm 24 years old. Although I get several of the listed side effects (muscle weakness, tingling & burning sensation, drowsiness to name a few), it works so quickly at getting rid of the pain I couldn't be without it now. The side effects only last an hour or so, so it's completely worth it.",9
"June 12, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I'm a 3-4 migraines per week person. When I first tried Imitrex, I thought I had found my own personal miracle.  Even on days that I didn't have a full blown migraine I would still have pain, and this was the first time I felt completely pain free in years. Unfortunately the honeymoon wore off after about 8 months.  I used Imitrex quite frequently during that time and had wonderful results, even though sometimes I had to take two pills to really do the job.  But after eight months, 2 pills weren't doing the job, my headache was still lingering.  ",5
"April 10, 2015",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I've been using Sumavel Dosepro and Sumavel pill form for over 3 years. The Dosepro has relieved/erased my migraine in less than 7 minutes 100% of the time. It's liquid gold in my opinion. The pill form is less effective 80% and takes up to 1hr.,10
"January 28, 2017",,Onzetra Xsail (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Went to see my neurologist for usual migraine check up, med refills, treatment. While there he suggested Botox (another story DO NOT DO IT, I am in horrible non stop pain) since I was in the middle of an episode I got a Toradol injection and this NEW Onzetra Nasal. Not a fan of anything going up my nose should have went with my gut instinct. You put one opening in a nostril the other in your mouth and blow. Like blowing up balloon, blowing powder through out your nose, soft palette and throat. It felt like sucking salt water up your nose, the pain was immediate, eye watering, dizzying, nose pinching, nauseous pain. I coughed, gagged, cried wanted to scream. 3 days later am worse than ever pain, shaking, incapacitated. Not worth it.",1
"May 18, 2015",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,From the moment I started taking Imitrex in 1996 it has worked wonderfully for me with probably only two or three occasions over the years  where a headache has persistent . It is been my wonder drug. I do get  very frequent migraines and take as little of it is possible but  I will normally take 10 to 12 50mg tablets per month with few if any side effects.,10
"June 1, 2016",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"My Migraine headache started when I was 16 or 17 years old. Now, I am 53 years old. I have migraine headache about once a week unless when I am on vacation. Usually, I have them on Monday afternoons because it's the first day of the work and I think my eyes get tired or maybe I have more stress. But, I can get Migraine for the number of reasons. Last night, for first time I used Imitrex. I had awful feelings. I cannot describe them but after couple hours my migraine was gone. I got very sleepy but it felt very good. The best part is that the next day I had no headache either. Because my headaches usually takes 2 days to go away. I hope that it works next week as well.",9
"August 19, 2010",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Doctor gave me a sample and a prescription of this to try. I have used Treximet with great results, but it took too long for the medicine to into my system to counter the migraine. The Sumavel works GREAT, HOWEVER it does hurt. The initial injection is painful. I was left with a welt and a tender spot for hours afterwards. The injection pain is well worth the relief. I do get the burning sensation at the bottom of my brain stem 30 seconds after the injection and feel very weak. This is all normal as I got the same feeling when I start Treximet. Luckily my insurance company covers it.",9
"December 11, 2015",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Helpless migraine victim for 20  years. My Dr. Recommended imitrex, so I took it. I took one 100mg, it tasted horrible, I had an upset stomach for almost 4 hours. I did get a heartburn feeling in my chest, hotflash, mood swings but my Migraine disappeared. I will speak to my neurologist regarding my side effects. I would consider using imitrex again in the future.",7
"December 16, 2013",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Took my husband to doctor while suffering a severe migraine with vomiting which he has suffered from his whole life(1-2 a month to the point of vomiting). After not being able to keep down pills this was his only hope of relief. Had first injection at doctor's office and within 15 minutes he had relief and was even able to go in to work the same day. I am so happy there is something that cures his pain. He said the shot hurt but it was worth it. The cost is high but also worth it when he is in that much pain. We paid $200 with discount card for 6 injections. You can find the discount card on their website. HIGHLY RECOMMEND when nothing else has helped.,10
"November 7, 2017",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have used fiorinal for years and had no problems, however my migraines have gotten worse over the last few months. I took a 100 mg imitrex yesterday and the side effects were terrible. My neck, head, throat, shoulders all became tight and felt as though I was ""high"" per se. I finally had to go up to bed and calm myself. I slept for 5 hours and woke up feeling groggy. If I need to take it again I will break it in half. It was a scary feeling. They only gave me 6 pills, thank goodness. I will stick with the fiorinal and a cup a coffee.",3
"August 31, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"This drug has saved me.  I was getting anywhere from 4 to 10 migraines a month, and losing a day or two each time.  Not to mention the pain, the nausea, the depressed feeling you get when you're stuck in bed feeling terrible. My doctor told me to try this, prescribed 100mg, so I did.  CANNOT say enough good things about this drug.  Pain is entirely gone after 30 minutes, and I have had no side effects.  Take it as soon as you know you're heading for a migraine.  Don't bother waiting to see if it's going to ""go away on its own"" because chances are it's going to get worse.  Practice self-care, also, and know your triggers.  But if all else fails, take one of these because they work.  I have to go to the pharmacy now to refill the prescription.  Last thing I want is to wake up with a headache and no Sumatriptan on hand.",10
"December 31, 2014",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Cluster Headaches:,"The first time I used the Dosepro, I was leary.  Within 10 minutes I was not only relieved of my migraine, but it was the most clear headed I felt in forever.  The second dose I took, I was not near my medicine and I had a full blown migraine, so it wasn't as good but a very close second.  I love this.  Freedom to make plans and not have to worry about cancelling due to migraine. Yeah!",10
"January 7, 2016",,For Migraine:,"I took one pill at onset, then took a second pill after 2 hours of no relief, as directed.  I spent a total of 5 hours puking and uncoordinated, except for the hour the 2nd pill knocked me out with drowsiness.

"January 12, 2016",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I'm only 16 and I was prescribed it at 15 and told only to take it when my migraines were unbearable.  Every time I have taken it I usually get a really sick feeling, such as hot flashes, weakness, nausea, and dizzy.  There's always like a feeling that my brain is being frozen over from where the migraine mostly is.  But I always take it and go straight to sleep except for last night.  I stayed up and I was seeing and hearing things that weren't there, I couldn't do simple tasks,  I forgot where my room was after my boyfriend told me to drink some water, I cried over everything, I was scared of everything. Staying awake for me was horrifying.",5
"October 13, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month,Onzetra Xsail (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I’ve had migraines since I was 5 and they’ve been chronic since my 20s (I’m mid-40s now). I haven’t been able to find a preventative that works but I respond really well to the triptans. Even if I catch a migraine late, a triptan will still abort it for me. The downside, I get more migraines each month than pills and I get rebounds pretty bad. For the past 10-15 years imitrex (sumatriptan) and relpax (eletriptan) have been my go-to's. I’ve been having some gastritis issues so we decided to try Onzetra instead of oral sumatriptan to bypass my stomach. AWFUL choice. Two doses of Onzetra barely took the edge off the migraine and I’ve been in severe pain ever since, counting the minutes until 24 hours is up and I can take a relpax. I’ll be switching back to my regular sumatriptan pills ASAP.",1
"April 16, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"Sumatriptan works amazing to take away my migraine as soon as I feel the tell tale pain above my eyebrow. However, I experience severe side effects such as jaw pain that prevents me from opening my mouth very far and chewing/swallowing. I also get tired and spaced out after taking this. The drug takes maybe 30 minutes to kick in and removes the migraine pain entirely, which is why I still rated it as effective. Works first time and every time, I never have to take a second dose.",10
"September 21, 2011",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been using Imitrex for over a year now. It works very well for me.  I had some trouble with chest pain for awhile. My Neurologist told me to try 1/4 to 1/2 tablet (25-50mg).  This has worked for me. The headache goes away and all side effects are diminished.  I found that the side effects varied depending on the manufacturer. There is something like a 7% variance in dosage (a 100 mg tablet can contain as little as 93 mg or as much as 107 mg of Sumatriptan). Also some coatings dissolve faster than others, therefore more severe side effects if the Sumatriptan is absorbed too rapidly.",8
"September 8, 2020",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"I told my primary care physician of headaches I was having.    Not especially severe but very persistent and not responding well to otc meds.   It would often require several otc doses over two to three days to obtain relief.    He gave me some Relpax samples and I took one at the onset of the next headache.   I had relief in about thirty minutes.    I was extremely pleased and continued use of the Relpax for perhaps two years until my insurer refused to cover that med any longer due to cost. My primary care prescribed sumatriptan as a replacement. It was equally effective, usually providing relief in as little as fifteen minutes. I used sumatriptan for perhaps three more years, then my headaches simply stopped - completely.     Have not had a headache requiring medication in the last six years.   Can't explain it, but I'll take it.   I never experienced noticeable side effects with either medication.   Am currently (sept 2020) 71 year old male.",10
"July 11, 2016",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,It works well when you can get to inject. This prescription with out insurance is over $900.00. I have had numerous instances where it did not inject. I have 3 out of 6 in my last prescription that failed. I just got satisfaction on a failed injector from January 2016. I now take the same prescription and it only is a $10 co pay where Suma Vel is &150 co pay. Robbery and the Endo pharmasuticals shood be ashamed,5
"April 29, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,the first few years i was prescribed imitrex i thought it was a miracle drug. now after ten years i find that i need to add excedrine migraine with it and i still have residual pain. still...it sure beats a full blown migraine.,7
"June 12, 2012",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"It worked to abort a cluster headache.  Just as effective, but not any more so, than the needle version of Imitrex/sumatriptan.  The injection stung quite a bit and left a fairly nasty welt similar to a wasp sting, and it bled a little bit, but it worked as advertised.",10
"April 10, 2019",,For Migraine:,"I have always had problems with migraines. About two and a half years ago, I’d had a migraine for about two weeks straight, and absolutely NOTHING would get rid of it. I got fed up and went to the doctor. They prescribed me with 100mg Sumatriptan. Constant migraines have subsided, but I will still get the occasional one, and it almost always happens when I drive long distances. But for example, I just drove back to Ohio from Virginia, and just after I got to Ohio, my head was killing me. I had stopped at a rest area, and had some of the pro drome symptoms going on as well. I tried to tough it out, but couldn’t handle it, so I took one. I stopped at the next rest area and hung out for about a half hour or so, and felt well enough to start driving again. About 20-30 minutes later, the migraine was gone. It takes my body a little while for it to work through, but hey. I do get some nausea, and stiff neck/shoulders/face, but I’d rather deal with that than the debilitating migraine.",10
"March 31, 2008",,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,These injections are a God send for Clusterers.  The ONLY drawback that I experienced was the expense which forbids me from using them on a regular basis...but the tablets are a good substitute... just takes much longer to work.  The injections work almost instantly..,9
"April 3, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"This drug works but not sure if it’s worth the scary side effects. It usually takes around 40-45 minutes for the drug to actually get rid of the headache. In that time, my neck will get very stiff. It’ll feel like my head is like a bowling ball. I’ll feel pretty weak and unfocused. Today I took it and had a numb, tingling feeling in my left hand. That went away after a few minutes then I started feeling heavy in my tongue. Next, the left side of my mouth and cheek starting going numb. For a minute there, I thought I was having a stroke! Luckily the numbness didn’t last more than 10 minutes but talk about freaky. The rest of the day I’ve been absolutely exhausted. Basically don’t plan on being able to have a productive day at work if you’re going to take this. At least in my experience. I’ve only taken it twice but the side effects have been the same.",5
"June 17, 2011",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,Gets rid of my headaches easily but sometimes takes an hour before it works.  Taking it on an empty stomach seems to speed up things.  The only down side is they are quite expensive even with insurance.,10

Mild dizziness, especially when bending, tinnitis is there, no dopey feeling, and I am finally relaxed! I tried EVERYTHING else...Topomax was a disaster, B12 shot, heat/cold, alcohol, no alcohol, diet, sleep, Toradol, Benedryl shot, Phenergan only way to sleep and not be sick!! Thank goodness - too bad I have no insurance and it costs A FORTUNE.",9
"June 27, 2016",,For Cluster Headaches:,"Had these headaches since I was 11. In my 20's did every test scan etc... No explanation. Only help offered was a highly addictive narcotic. I chose to skip it. My life was severely affected- I had headaches when happy, sad, having fun, pms, special occasion, etc.... Everyone knew my headaches were 3+ days of barely functioning. Then my daughter started getting them- game changer for me. Could not let her suffer the same way. Dr prescribed Imitrex (generic). It works for both of us!! We feel like we can live without fear of the next one. She is out of the country for 6 weeks- without this she never could have gone! Our lives are totally different now!",10
"May 7, 2015",,For New Daily Persistent Headache:,"I've suffered with tension headache and migraine for years and nothing has ever really helped with the pain, until now. As soon as I feel one coming one I take one tablet and the pain is gone with 20/30 minutes. The only downside to using this medicine is the side effects I have. Hot flushes and a heavy burning sensation in my legs almost like growing pains. But I much rather the side effects than the headache.",9
"December 25, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have high regard for Imitrex.  And the generic first provided by Dr. Reddy was equal to the original Imitrex.  However, I have recently been required to use a different generic and it is basically worthless.  I was taking 50 milligrams and having the migraine gone within an hour.  Now a 100 milligram tablet has little effect and I usually have to take a second 100 milligram tablet to get any relieve.  I would sure like to know how the generic industry works because for me it does not seem to be quite up to speed, at least with the drug that I need most.",9
"November 16, 2019",,For New Daily Persistent Headache:,"I suffer with very bad anxiety and stress so as a result of this I get regular tension headaches. Normal painkillers, paracetomol, ibuprofen etc don't work so I visited my GP who prescribed sumatriptan and from day one of using these the headaches went within one hour. In my experience, they are the best medication for headaches.
I'm lucky I don't have any side effects as some of my friends do.",10
"April 8, 2009",,Imitrex Nasal (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex nasal sprays changed my life. I developed migraines when I was about 13 years old. At that time the doctor would simply prescribe pain killers for treatment, but they did nothing. They only helped me sleep for a few hours and then I would wake back up to the headache again.  After seeing a neurologist I was prescribed Imitrex. I have tried all three forms of the medication, the pills did not work as well for me because I always vomit with a migraine.  I simply did not get enough doses with the injections to last a month, only two in a prescription.  But with the nasal sprays, I receive 6 each month and they work GREAT.",10
"November 13, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This was the first time I took it,
got a migraine 2 days in a row after getting auras, worked for me, I still had pain but very very minimal compared to the past. I haven't had a migraine in 19 months before this",10
"November 22, 2015",,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"The medication itself is effective and clears a migraine in about 10 minutes. However, my pen always breaks eventually and sometimes my replacement pens are faulty as well. I have a reserve of the medication, because I have been unable to take it. They need to design a better injection system.",5
"December 5, 2014",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"I've had migraines (about 4-6 times a month) since early puberty, and after a few hospital visits my mother finally took me to a specialist and got a sumatriptan prescription. It has greatly improved my quality of life. It kicks in after about 40 minutes for me (longer than advertised, but I'm on a small dosage due to my small frame). It does leave me feeling heavy and numb, and it has made me nauseated on occasion. It's uncomfortable, but much better than a migraine.",9
"January 8, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Cluster Headaches:,"I have chronic cluster headaches.  The injections are the only medicine that will abort an attack.  I have used the injections with no side effects for over 10 years.  I get the vials and inject 2-3 ml.  I have overused this medicine at times knowing it can cause rebounds, but the pain of a cluster headache is so severe, I will do anything to make it stop.   I have no history of heart disease and am relatively healthy otherwise.  This medicine has saved my life.",
"September 23, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Alsuma (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Severe Migraines/Cluster Headaches: 8  years. Intensity/frequency varies.  intensity is around 9-10(10 point scale) frequency is around 3 - 4 per week, some lasting 2 -3 days. I have tried many medications, most Triptans - Maxalt, Zomig, Relpax, Frova. Axert works well for me, but when it doesn't I use Alsuma Injection. It works like a Epipen injection you give yourself. Place the pen against your skin and push hard. There is a jolt, and then the needle point emerges and you keep it there for 5 seconds. The pain from the prick is not bad because the needle is small. The jolt is kinda scary. I have to brace myself, but way worth it. It WORKS. Some nausea, but not much other side effects. I usually go to sleep right after I take it.",10
"February 5, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome:,I've suffered from cyclic vomiting for over 10 years and the only thing that brings me relief(I've suffered for over a week before with the intense vomiting and dibilitating migraines and had to be hospitalized due to dehydration and pain and panic attacks.)My GP actually prescribed me the injectable form and at the first sign I take an injection then usually wait 10 minutes and give myself a second injection and this medication has saved my life. ,10
"December 27, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"The magic migraine medicine!  I'm 47 years old and have suffered from moderately severe migraines since I was 11. The list of different drugs I've taken over the years is too long to recite, and the only other drug that has been effective in any way is Fioricet/Fiorinal, but I develop a tolerance to Fiorinal. I was skeptical when I first tried Imitrex, but have become  a believer! I have taken both nasal spray and tablets and both work quickly and thoroughly with NO SIDE EFFECTS. Truly the magic, miracle migraine medicine, for which I am sincerely grateful.",10
"May 1, 2013",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I've been suffering from headache for over 10 years. Headache could last up to a week, it was horrible. Took so many pain medicines and it didn't work. I ended up with craniotomy last year and metal plates on my skull bone. I was fine for few months-no headache. Few months ago the headaches came back again. Now I'm miserable again when the headache come...I got this injection Sumavel DosePro....after the injection my head feels like it explodes and I fell asleep right away....after an hour-two the headache is gone...it's great medicine....it's working right away.....through the skin and blood vessels.

"August 8, 2019",,For Migraine:,"I am 41yrs old.  Had my 1st migraine in 4th grade.  They all start the same, visual disturbance.  Zig zag lightning bolts and blotches that make my vision unbearable. I went through my childhood without any meds for migraines, bed ridden for 2 to 3 days.  Vomiting, sweating, excruciating head pain, vision disturbances for hours.  It was horrible.  Finally was introduced to Imitrex. What a difference this drug made with my headaches.  Now as an adult I am prescribed 100mg sumatriptan. It does not prevent or completely do away with each migraine but it does cut it down to a few hours of pain and suffering.  Without the vomiting.  Side effects for me, feeling of swelling in my throat, skin sensitivity throughout my body.  I also feel wiped out the following day, not sure if this is the med or from the migraine.  I've just become accustomed to the way it makes me feel. Fair trade for a short lived less painful migraine.",9
"August 15, 2018",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,"This med has been a life saver for me and  I have been on it many years. I get migraines that cause pain all in my head, neck, shoulders as well as nausea/vomiting, mood change, inability to think straight etc. The first time I took it I remember feeling a warm dull pressure (not painful though) in my neck and shoulders, but I've never experienced it since then. This med completely gets rid of my headache within about 30 minutes. I am SO thankful my dr. prescribed this to me years ago-it's improved my quality of life. I am however, looking to move to a new state with less barometric pressure changes, seeing as I live in one of the worst cities for migraines. My guess is location is the cause of migraines for the majority of people.",10
"August 8, 2013",Taken for less than 1 month,For Cluster Headaches:,"I've been dealing with episodes of cluster headaches for 30 years. Nothing has ever made a dent in the pain besides this and Zomig nasal spray. The slight pain of the injection is a very small price to pay to relieve the crushing pain of a cluster headache. For me the trick for both medicines is to catch it as early as possible, before the headache is full blown. I'm never more than a minute or two away from a dose. Besides feeling a little weak afterwards (which would have been worse with the headache anyway), so far I don't have any real side effects.",10
"October 24, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I only take the lowest dose of this drug though I'm sure it's time to upgrade to the higher dose. But even with the lower dose I am totally relieved, all the aching head stuff, all the swimming nausea, gone, it's like total relief! Now this took some time, didn't work first few times but then when  I put faith in it and finally it did,  boy did it!",10
"October 19, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Cluster Headaches:,"Sumatriptan is a life changer. I've suffered from cluster headaches for 24 years having one at least once a week and NOTHING has ever come close to helping. Now I haven't had one in 3 months. I take a pill when I feel a cluster headache coming which successfully aborts it. Even hours into a full blown attack I took a pill and relieved 95% of the pain. 

Another great thing? My insurance covers it 100%. Even better: it is only $16 for 9 pills (you can break them in half and have 18) without insurance.",10
"November 6, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"After 20+ years of taking this medicine it has lead up to hair thinning out severely, full body muscle pain and weakness as a side effect and a possible stroke. It works to get rid of the migraine but this what happens when you take it long term.",5
"July 17, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"These Sumavel shots are amazing. Whenever I wake up with a cluster headache, I take one of these and within 5 minutes, the headache is completely gone. The injections site swells, and is sore for a while, but I'll take that over the headache any day. My neck and shoulder on the side of the cluster pain end up feeling exhausted after I take it, like I've just been working out, but since the headaches typically wake me up, feeling exhausted helps me get back to sleep pretty quickly. My insurance only covered so many shots, so the last box of 6 shots were out of pocket at $100 a piece.",10
"March 2, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I took this for the first time nearly 20 years ago and it caused so much pain I passed out and didn't wake up for 18 hours. Last year my doctor prescribed it to me again thinking I may have grown out of it. So a couple of days later I was having a bad migraine and I took it. After just a few minutes my skull started feeling like it was on fire. The pain was so intense I immediately started pacing not knowing what to do. I ended up laying down while my wife brought me ice packs and I eventually passed out just as I did 20 years ago.,1
"September 14, 2014",,For Migraine:,"I would NOT have a life without it! I've tried everything. Nothing works for me but this! I've been on it 11 years. I started out with pen injections, then nose spray...pill suits me best! I don't wish these on anyone! Migraines are horrible.",10
"May 20, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I have been getting migraine headaches since I can remember. Started with the lowest dose of sumatriptan pill. That and then I increased the dose to the 50mg and really it didn't do anything.
I find this medication works best if you take it within the first half an hour to 45 minutes. If I feel one coming on and take it right away it works best.
If I don't take it right way or within the first 45 minutes then most of the time I will need a second dose. If I do take within that time frame I can get rid of the migraine. If it is not 100 % gone I can follow it up with an excedrin migraine or two 3 to 3.5 hours after and that dose the trick.

Some side effects are moderate upset stomach and just feeling out of it.",9
"July 10, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"(UK) My 13yr old daughter (petite and very light) started getting monthly migraines 6 months ago. I also had them as a teenager and didn't want her to suffer. Went to the doctor and got these on prescription. There was a major warning on the screen ""not for under 18's"" so I was a little worried, but doctor gave her the dose for a younger child. Yesterday she got her usual blind spot at 7.20am. Took the tablet immediately, and by 8.50 she sat up in bed, no headache, no vomiting, migraine disappeared. She felt a bit dopey and looked a bit pale for a few hours and didn't eat much. From 12 until 9pm she performed in her music fair and concert. Unbelievable!!",10
"April 28, 2016",,Zecuity (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have had migraine for 20 years and been on every migraine medicine.  I am diagnosed as chronic with 15 or more migraine days a month. My doctor is very progressive with new treatments and offered zecuity because it is considered to be very clean as far as triptan side effects and no hangover or fog. I was properly trained on how to use the medicine with insuring a good seal, since it is a patch and forewarned that it can be uncomfortable the first 5 or 10 minutes. I put it on, ensuring a good seal. Activated the red LED button. It was prickly for about 10 minutes. Annoying, but not painful. My migraine was completely gone in 30 minutes. I had redness at the active site of delivery but it went away in a few days. No other side effects.",9
"February 9, 2014",,For Migraine:,This pill has completely changed my life I highly recommend it to anyone that suffers from migraines. As soon as you feel the symptoms you take it and it goes away in a half hour to an hour and if it doesn't you take another one and it will go away. I suffer from migraines and had to be in bed for sometime 2 days. This really works for me.,10
"February 18, 2015",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"This is the best medication I have tried for crippling migraines. As long as it is taken at the first sign of a true migraine, Imitrex completely takes away the pain and nausea but it does cause extreme drowsiness and the feelings of a hangover the next day (IMO both side effects are definitely better than a migraine!)",9
"March 1, 2014",,For Migraine:,"I have had migraines ever since I can recall my earliest headaches. I'm lucky that mine progress slowly giving me time to take either ibuprofen or naproxen to take care of the majority of my migraines. That said every once in a while I get a acute enough or resistant enough attack that I take Imitex (sumatriptan) and usually within 20 min my migraines are less severe and within an hour completely resolved. I do however have odd side effects. If I feel nauseous prior to taking Imitrex it makes my nausea more severe. Every time I use sumatriptan my body feels run down and weak, almost as if I have taken a muscle relaxer. Regardless it is a Godsend when I need it. I have 100 mg pills that I cut into quarters. I usually only need 25 mg.",9
"June 30, 2019",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,I’ve had migraines since a teen - used to call them eye aches. My mother also had them and never found relief. I started on sumatriptan in my forties. I used to try everything else otc first because you only get nine pills per month. Then I started to take a half pill or 25mg at the very first inkling of a headache and cut the number of pills needed per month dramatically. I refill regularly but now have several months worth in reserve. This drug always clears my migraine.,9

Neck becomes weak right after taking, this feeling goes away after a few minutes. 6 to 10 hours after taking my mood becomes easily irritable.",9
"September 24, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for New Daily Persistent Headache:,"I love this medicine! I was on 50mg tablets, then I was switched to 6mg shots.

"December 31, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I am 51 and suffered with migraines since about age 20; didn't get Imitrex until my early 30's.  It has saved my life, without it I was worthless for a day. Fortunately I can cut 100mg into 3 and it works for me.  I would lay down for 20 minutes and headache gone. Recently I have had to use the generic and didn't think anything of it and have found I need to take a 100mg and now I get side effects I didn't before.  Just the weird feelings from vasodilatation in my chest and sometimes my legs.  Sometimes the 100mg doesn't take it completely away. I am a nurse and will look for another alternative because I would have to pay $600 for 3 boxes out of pocket if I want the brand.",10
"November 5, 2014",Taken for less than 1 month,For New Daily Persistent Headache:,"Haven't seen many people with my experience so I appreciate Housewifeandmothers input below. Maybe my problem is also with generic sumatriptan. Maybe my dose at 100mg is too high? But 3 out of 4 times after taking it I became horribly nauseous and vomited the pill up within 10 minutes of taking it. I'm afraid to ever go near it again! Still looking for relief from my daily crippling headaches. Vicodin and Hydrocodone seem to be the only thing to relieve my pain. Started taking magnesium supplements as well, but no improvement yet. But FYI, I think my experience is uncommon.",1
"December 23, 2017",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Onzetra Xsail (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Onzetra xsail works for me.  It's a wonderful drug with minimal side effects. Pain almost gone within 5-10 min of using.  If pain comes back (which it did 2/8 times) I took again and migraine gone. Get 7-8 migraines per month. Very grateful for med. Extremely expensive however... May need to switch to pill form. :(,9

I used to treat them with just OTC meds but of course as soon as they wore off it came back. While pregnant I was prescribed Fioricet but headache would still come back. Then I finally got Imitrex and it makes the headache NOT come back! I do only take it at night just for the drowsiness, but no other side effects for me, and headache is gone when I wake up!",10
"November 8, 2011",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Imitrex took away my migraine but I could not function on it.  I had to lay down completely still and go to sleep because it made me so nauseous I felt like vomiting every time I moved.  I was extremely dizzy and it made my skin painful to the touch.

"November 19, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"My doctor gave me a sample of Imitrex when it first came out. It was a MIRACLE drug for me.

I went in and they gave me Sumavel DosePro to see if the medicine was effective. The initial ""injection"" was awful. It hurt as bad as my migraines did, only in my thigh. Then I felt extremely dizzy, and my whole body was sore and I had trouble breathing. They let me rest for about 20 minutes before sending me home with a sample of Treximet. I got home and took a nap for about 30 minutes. When I woke up, I felt better than I had in months. Finally my head felt clear and I had energy back!

"August 4, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"It keeps my migraines from blowing out into a severe migraines, but it takes close to an hour to kick in and when it does I feel extremely sick, very fatigued for two hours after.  Then I have just a mild headache, but I feel like I have a hang over and become forgetful and weak.  It is definitely a trade off, but as severe as my migraine can get, I'll take with this until I find another type of medication.",5
"January 6, 2017",,For Migraine:,"I was given these whilst in hospital as although I've had low pressure headaches the consultant decided it now have migraines?! .. so I mentioned to them I have bad anxiety especially when it comes to my health and any feelings within myself that I'm not ready for can make me panic. So they gave me the tablets, said to take one at home and I cannot explain the feelings I felt almost immediately after taking it -- my face started tingling around my nose and cheeks- my hands tingled, my throat was tight, my heart didn't feel right and my head felt almost numb. I wanted to be sick and I felt shakey... did I have any migraine? NO, but I would rather have a headache than experience all of those feelings. I wasn't informed of them!",1

This is seriously the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me. If I take it at the first sign of my migraine it will be completely  gone within 15 minutes!! There has been only once that my migraine did not go away so I had to take another one. It definitely burns when it goes in but that subsides in a few seconds for me. The medication does drip down the back of my throat for a while but I don't mind that because my head isn't pounding. I do feel a bit fuzzy for about 15 minutes but it does go away.

They could last up to three days, the first time I tried imitrex....  It was quite literally the Holy grail from then on.  The pills take away any aura or migraine in about 20 to 30 minutes and the shots give immediate relief.  Wether or not it's a placebo,  I swear to the gods,  as soon as you inject into your upper thigh your migraine goes down a few pegs.  Within a few minutes,  nearly or entirely gone.  If you have migraines or clusters ask your doctor.  Don't take irresponsibly because it can have some weird effects on people.",10
"March 27, 2012",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"My first experience with Imitrex was taking it at work...well, that was not a good idea!

I stood up and my arms and legs went totally numb. Since I'm on Topamax too I expect a little tingle, but this was a RUSH. All this aside, about 30 minutes later most of my heavy duty migraine symptoms were thwarted. Not gone, but a lot better. I feel they would have been much better if I had been able to lie down rather than been on my feet working. I also still had a pretty decent headache and photophobia the rest of the day.",7

If I get a migraine in school, I am supposed to take an Imitrex and go straight back to class. Unfortunately for me, the Imitrex makes me extremely drowsy and sometimes delirious, usually forcing me to go home and still live with the pain of migraines for at least another 12 hours, but it can still last for up to 3 days afterwards. Thankfully, the Nortriptyline works 95% of the time, but the Imitrex only works a good 75% of the time, and then I'm still put out of commission.",4

During one particularly excruciating attack, I called my GP crying. She prescribed me sumatriptan (tablet form), and it has been great. It takes away all of the pain within an hour, even if I take it while the migraine is already past the initial stages. I do get side-effects - slight loss of sensation in my extremities, fatigue and a feeling as if there is a weight on my chest. The first time this worried me, but now I'm used to it.

I usually take narcotics and have Zofran for the nausea, but if I wake up with a full blown migraine the meds don't stay down even with the Zofran The patch is complicated to set up, but it worked.  Sunday I had a migraine, it didn't work as well and I have a raised red circular welt on my arm that itches like anything.  I am going to the doctor tomorrow so I'll check it out with him.

It hurt a lot more than I was expecting, and bled more than my neurologist and pharmacist said it would, so immediately after administering it, I was pretty apprehensive.  I felt the side effects most people have reported (weakness, dizziness, heaviness, etc.), but I also had some nausea and I was really tired.  I felt near-immediate relief of about 50% of my migraine, and then took a power nap for about 45 minutes. When I woke up, I felt like a completely new person.",9
"November 14, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"Had clusters 37 years now. I've tried literally EVERYTHING out there. The only thing that works for immediate relief is imitrex injections. If med takes too long (nasal or pill), it simply doesn't work. Gabapentin (sp) regime should be started immediately, they eventually stop the nerve from spasms. Imitrex is now available generic (sumatriptan), however, still expensive. I pay $75/shot only available as a two-pack.",10
"November 29, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"I've used sumatriptan for about 2 years to treat my migraines that I've had since I was 10. They're mostly period and stress related headaches. Nothing had ever helped and I'm excited that I can finally get on with my life without laying bed for days suffering in pain. It works pretty quickly- 10 or 15 minutes after I take the medication. It's a life saver.
It does make my extremities tingly and sensitive to heat and cold. But overall I'm thankful to have an option.",8
"April 13, 2013",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"After years of migraines that lasted three days at a time and nothing working to get rid of them this is awesome. I was worried about being able to do the injection myself, but it wasn't bad. It felt like a bee sting. Within a minute it felt like the top of my head was going to explode. Within 10 minutes it was subsiding. It was completely gone in less than an hour. There was no ""buzzy worn out feeling"" like I normally have after my migraines. I had plenty of energy and felt great.  The prescription discount card is a great help too!",10
"March 31, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"If you are a migraine sufferer this is a MIRACLE DRUG! Yes the ""injection"" is sort of painful (for like 10 secs) and I only experienced a little soreness in the spot afterwards.. But within 15 mins of the injection my DEBILITATING MIGRAINE WITH NAUSEA AND BLURRED VISION WAS GONE! I was able to head to work and put in a full 10 hours as normal! No nausea, no follow up dosage, no pills, just a little sleepiness. I'm a 35 yr old female that suffers from 1-4 migraines with vomiting, light sensitivity, blurred vision per month. Yes, they are expensive, but I am lucky enough to have great insurance coverage thru my employer and only pay $15 per mon for 6 of these",9
"September 23, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,I take medication regularly for migraines. My HEB Pharmacy switched to the Northstar brand  of sumatriptan and now I'm having to take double the dose to get rid of my migraines causing me to go through a lot more prescriptions a lot quicker. They are not near as effective.  The funny thing is is that I'm also taking a couple of other prescriptions from Northstar one of them includes generic Ambien and those are not as effective either. I would rather pay a little more and get a better quality product and know that I don't have to worry about whether or not I'm going to get rid of my migraine or I'm going to be able to get my window sleep. I am searching for a new Pharmacy to get away from Northstar products.,3
"March 10, 2017",,For Migraine:,"I've been getting migraines for years and every doctor kind of wrote it off as hormones or stress and just told me to relax and take advil. They would last a couple days. I couldn't get out of bed the whole time. Just constant pounding in my neck, eye, teeth and forehead. Last month, I finally talked an neurologist into seeing me without a referral and he couldn't believe my other doctors and let it go on so long and not sent me to him. 
He gave me the generic imitrex and said to take it with the anti-nausea med promethazine.
I had to use it for the first time yesterday. It was amazing. In 30 mins I could tell it was going away. I felt a little foggy for an hour or so and my reaction time was decreased for a few hours, but I'll take it!",10
"October 6, 2012",Taken for 2 to 5 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Imitrex works for me even if I let it get to the really bad headache--hate to take because of the tightness in chest and achy throat afterwards.

"January 10, 2017",,For New Daily Persistent Headache:,"I've been having chronic headaches for the past month to the point where they get severe (not a migraine) so I asked my dr for Sumatripan and she gave me it, little did I know it doesn't get rid of the headache nor relieve it, I'm on day 2 of it and all it's done is make me dizzy, my chest feel heavy and horrible that I can't breathe and need to cough hard, my shoulders feel heavy and achein my neck, and it's made my headache feel like a full blown migraine which I haven't felt for 4 years, never having it again I don't recommend this medication it's made me feel really horrible",1
"November 18, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,I've been suffering really bad migraines for the last 4 r 5 wks. At first i bought over the counter tabs like anadin extra paracetamol ect. Altho these meds worked eventualy i would still go between 20/40mins in excruciating pain then id get a few hours of relief then it would start al over again it was very exhaustin an so painful. Eventualy I went to the doc he prescrided naproxen these tablets didnt even touch the pain after a few days I resorted back to over the counter meds. Then I went back to the doctor he prescrided sumatripton tabs yesterday. I took my first tab early this morn when I felt the pain. The relief was amazing. It took the edge of the pain strait away and was barable less than 10mins the pain was gone. Best relief ever,10
"August 1, 2015",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I am 53 and have suffered migraines since high school. Nothing I could administer myself has ever worked even the tiniest bit. After going to my Dr for a Toradol shot he told me to try the Sumavel Dosepro injection. He told me it was far from painless. The injection feels like being stung by a bee, but is tolerable because you eventually get use to it. It is far better than laying in bed for three days in the dark and vomiting. It bruises and sometimes causes slight bleeding, but even with that and the injection pain...totally worth it. The first time I had an injection it took half an hour for relief, but now my headaches are gone in 5 minutes. It is a miracle drug for me. I love it. I pay $60 for a box of 6 and ins. pays $1,000.",10
"February 8, 2013",,For Cluster Headaches:,"This is the first time I have used Sumatriptan , it was Arrow-Sumatriptan injection.  I immediately felt a slight pressure in my chest and a pushing in my temples and the base of my skull and felt tired and weak.  There was a tingling sensation in my nose and my throat was ultra sensitive.  It is an hour since I injected and my cluster headache has eased but not gone away yet.  My eye has stopped streaming and nose not running so fast and I look slightly more human.  I had hoped for better than this but it is an improvement.",5
"July 3, 2013",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"I recently started taking Sumatriptan. It was ok at first. I took it whenever I felt a migraine coming on and it usually took care of most of my symptoms, some sensitivity to light and sounds continued. But for migraines at work (which I would get all the time) it is terrible because of the sleepiness. I often will have to try to fight all day at work just to stay awake.",4
"June 25, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I started using Imitrex about two months ago.  It does wonders for me.  I take a short nap in a dark, quiet room after taking the medication and this helps a great deal.  I have not had any side effects.  I love it and recommend it!",9
"June 25, 2013",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,I have suffered migraines since I was in grade school (I'm now 45). My headaches used to come on in the late afternoon and put me in bed for the rest of the day but I would wake up next morning feeling ok. Now my headaches come on about 3-4 in the morning and last 2 days of non stop vomiting and pain. The doctor put me on Topamax daily but the side effects keep causing me to overheat in the Texas weather. The doctor just put me on sumatriptan 100mg and I just had an attack 2 days ago. I took 1 pill and it did nothing. 3 hours later I took a second dose and I still ended up in bed for 14 hours. ,2

"April 17, 2013",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This medication for the price worked the best. I was using this along with Topamax as a daily preventative and also started receiving botox injections.  I found that after a few months between the botox, the Topamax and the Imitrex, I was able to use less and less each month.",10
"August 11, 2016",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have a serious issue with Migraines. Almost 6 a week. When the device was first prescribed back in 2010, I did not have a problem since they were coming from San Diego from Telegenics. Once ENDO started producing the product, all I have are failures. I have had as many as 5 of 6 in a box fail to work. 
I have had several that after I tried to use them, they spontaneously ""went off"" on the bathroom counter. Luckily not in my face. I have contacted ENDO, at this point now early August 2016, I have not received even 1 replacement for the 18 that failed. You know the cost. My insurance will stop paying for them in a couple of months.
I reported every one to Endo. But the issue is getting worse. I have reported this chronic issue to the FDA",9
"October 13, 2016",,For Migraine:,"Been experiencing migraines/headaches since I could remember. I'm unable to take Nsaids so meds such as Cambia are not an option for me (which helped but not as well). Daily medications such as Topamax were not effective enough to warrant the extreme fatigue. Finally, after requesting an ""as needed"" dosing med, a doctor prescribed this one. Took dose shortly after symptoms began (oral tab). Took roughly an hour to take effect but it really helped! I had option for 2nd dose but felt enough relief to get through evening. Had some side effects but they were tolerable and did not worry me since I read what to expect ahead of time. Side effects short lived comared to constant fatigue of alternatives and worth the relief I received.",8

I take 100 mg at the first sign, and it prevents it 80% of the time.  If taken after the headache starts, it stops the pain within 1 hour, and much faster if I lay down.  Yes, there are mild side effects--drowsiness, sensitivite to hot and cold, but it sure is better than a headache.",9
"June 19, 2013",Taken for 1 to 2 years,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I have suffered from migraines since I was 20 and am now 34. I have tried countless abortive medicines.  Sumavel is the best one by far because it relieves the pain and nausea fast (usually within 10 mins for me).  The injection is painful and leaves quite a welt but far worth it to get relief.  I do sometimes have issues with it not firing properly but it could be just me pulling back at the last second when I anticipate the pain coming.  I have wasted quite a few shots this way.,9
"June 22, 2021",Taken for 5 to 10 years,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,I’ve been having cluster headaches for about 5 years! I take the pill form of imitrex I sometimes have to take two of them!  The first one seems to take the edge off but after two hours I end up taking another one which eventually gets rid of the awful pain in the eye!! I wish they would work quicker and better but at least it helps!! I have chronic cluster headaches so when there’s a short lived period of no headaches I’m relieved! I’m not tried the other forms of Imitrex but I might mention it to my doctor!,8
"April 5, 2014",,For Migraine:,"Have had migraines on and off for years.  I used Fioricet the last 8 years
with good results but then my system must have changed that they did 
not work anymore.
After talking to an Neurologist and having blood work etc. done she put
me on Imitrex (Sumatriptan) 100mg. which worked great.  
Only thing I do is split these into 50mg. pieces and they still work good.
From reading on different forums I did notice a lot of our fellow migraine
sufferers get relief from 25 to 50mg.  
Also, I have not had any side effects taking the 100mg.
Only negative for me is that they are pricey about $10 for 9 pills! Why
nine who knows but they work and its worth it to me.",9
"April 1, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Cluster Headaches:,"Well I was having really bad cluster headaches, I took an imitrex for the first time.

"August 24, 2010",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have had migraines for over 10 years and have tried many different drugs. My doctor gave me Sumavel to try about a week ago (just in time for another migraine attack). The initial injection did hurt but the relief that I was able to get only 10 minutes later was well worth it. I did have the ""burning sensation"" in my face for a few minutes and felt weak for about 30 minutes but for me that is much better than the pain of a migraine. The only problem that I had was it seemed to only work for a few hours for me the first time I tried it. I'm willing to give this medicine time to work because it has by far done so much more for me than any other medicine that I have tried.",8
"October 27, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This review is for the injectable form of Imitrex (sumatriptan) only. For anyone that has tried the pill or nasal spray forms and found them ineffective, please try the injections. They work wonders and act fast. I've tried the other types and they actually seemed to make me more nauseous and (especially the nasal spray).  I keep one in my purse at all times so that I can get relief anytime a migraine hits. The pain is not bad as the needle is very small and thin. You don't have to jab yourself, just press against your skin and push a button. The pain of migraine is much worse! I've found the most comfortable injection site to be the bit of fat at the top of my buttox. I use the 6mg injections but I'm pretty sure there is also a lower dose.",9
"November 13, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I find Imitrex to be very effective against my migraines as long as I take it at the start of one. The first and second time I took Imitrex, I experienced stomach cramps. The next time I had to take it, I had eaten shortly before and this greatly reduced the cramping. If I'm nauseous I obviously won't be able to eat a full meal, but the cramps do seem to be decreasing each time I take it anyway. The only other side effects I have are a burning sensation in my nose, and a sore throat, which are both tolerable. Imitrex is very expensive, but definitely worth it to me. I can take a tablet, lay down for an hour or two, and then get back up to live life again.",8
"September 4, 2008",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I love this medicine! Before I would always worry about the next time I was going to get a headache. I couldn't work or play with my son, I hated it. But now if I get one I can just take my imitrex and 30 minutes later its gone like I never had a headache at all! The only thing I dont like is it is pricey, but I will pay because it works very well. Now that I have tried it, I couldn't live without it.",10
"April 8, 2014",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"I get migraines with aura. Right when I begin to lose my vision, I know the migraine is 30 minutes away. I take an Imitrex as soon as I start to lose my vision. It works within an hour or two about 80% of the time. I feel very weak and ""out of it"" when I do take one. It still doesn't help with nausea, however. I have not thrown up from a migraine (yet), just very nauseous.

I have also used the injectable version. That works SO much better. However, I have psyched myself out and can no longer give myself a shot for some reason.

Physical Therapy has really helped with my migraines. I also quit going to the chiropractor. I used to get migraines weekly, now it's been 6 months and I finally got one today.",8
"May 11, 2014",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"The injectable version works well for my infrequent (every 2-3) months migraines. It stops them dead in their tracks. The only downside is it leaves me feeling a little out of, as if I'd better not operate any heavy machinery.
I also err by not taking it as soon as the pain hits. That's because I hate jabbing myself with a needle. Bizarrely, I also get migraines with aura but no pain. The aura is only visible in my left eye, and looks like fluttering black fringe. So weird. The first time it happened, I was sure I was having a brain bleed. When it went away without my dying or having a stroke, I figured it was just my brain chemistry throwing a party, one with black streamers.",10
"June 29, 2021",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"I have used sumatriptan 100mg for years and it has worked, sometimes it takes an hour so, but it works.

I was in bed so it was a welcome feeling. I was wondering if anyone else has had that experience. It was strange, but wonderful !",10
"October 14, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex shot is a very effective drug for me. Have had migraines for decades and was introduced to imitrex after 2 years of having blinding aura then 2 days of suffering in a dark room. Imitrex shot works within minutes. No pain killer needed. Once I give myself the shot, I lay down for about an hour. Only issues are brief fatigue, nausea for a few minutes and a strange prickly sensation in the top of my head which goes away quickly.",9
"September 10, 2018",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,I love this medicine! It has given me back my life. When I first started taking it I would get super tired and HAVE to sleep for an hour but I have been taking for a year and have no side effects any more. For me it starts working within 10 min and the migraine is gone with in an hour. Most of the time I don’t even need to take a full dose... just a half of a pill. The only bummer is my insurance company will only let me have so many of these pills every 20 days and because I suffer from migraine all but maybe 4 days a month I run out.,10
"July 20, 2015",,For Migraine:,"I take Sumatriptan for menstrual migraines and this medication has been an absolute lifesaver for me. If I take a 50 mg tablet  when the migraine starts, I have 100% relief within 30 minutes. If I wait until the migraine is really bad then it takes about an hour to kick in.  My migraines generally last 2 days and the first dose wears off in about 12 hours so I usually have to take another dose. The only side effects I experience are a slight head rush that goes away after about 10 minutes. I would recommend trying to take a nap after taking this medication which really helps.",10

So I was doing fantastic from Oct to Jan no migraine and going from 3 a mth on average for what seems a lifetime to nothing was amazing UNTIL January.  I had two week long ones and another early . Feb.  Anyway I saw consultant yesterday 26th Feb, was upped to 75mg nortriptyline and given imigran injection to try. Sods law developed one yesterday pm .  So took first injection at 11.15am and within an hour I felt better but not 100% so I'm unsure what to think.

The problem is most insurance will only pay for 1 box per month which leaves me missing work and banging my head against the wall for the other 25-27 days of the month. I don't know who made this medicine and why they would market it for clusters knowing that when people are in a cluster attack period get up to 6 or 7 ""Suicide Headaches"" per day.

This injection is awesome though! Quick relief without having to make a trip to the ER. I usually get Toradol shots at the hospital that make the headache disappear within twenty minutes of so. The initial injection of the Sumavel hurt a little and caught me off guard, but it felt like a bee sting, it just hurt for a second and then it was over.

I do feel my headache pain jumping from a 3 -> 10 immediately after injection.  Taking the 100mg tablets does not cause this increase in pain, but the wait is about 25-30 mins for relief.

I have learned to be patient and continue to hold the applicator in place and continually push it into my skin until the injector fires.  It sometimes takes a while, but it does eventually goes off.  You just need to be patient.  Yes, it's frustrating, but when you have a migraine, it's worth the wait.  This has been a miracle drug for me and I will continue to use it as long as it is available to me!",10
"March 29, 2018",,For Migraine:,"I was prescribed this medication for migraine. I took it at work during my lunch for the first time....big mistake. My head felt like a swollen balloon, I was disoriented, loopy, delusional, heavy, weird as ever and very tired. I wanted to lay down on my desk and cry or go home but I could not. My dosage was 100 mg. The next time I took it I cut it in half and it was not as bad of a feeling than before. I recommend to try it at home first to see how your body reacts first..not at work lol",7
"June 30, 2011",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I have tried both the injection and tablet and it's has worked wonders. I have suffered with migraines since I was middle school (now 31 yrs old) and this is the first medicine that has given me any relief. The side effects only last for about 10 minutes so it's no problem. The only issue I have is after about 4 or 5 hours the migraine seem to start up right. Either way any relief is better than suffering through a migraine.,8
"May 13, 2011",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I've suffered from migraines since I was in the 3rd grade and I am now 23. I take Topamax every night to try and control my headaches but when I get a really bad one I use the Sumavel. HATE HATE HATE needles. So this works for me very good. There is pain with the injection but compared to the migraine, its nothing. A little bleeding at the site and always a bruise. I can instantly feel the medicine working in my body and within 5-7 minutes my migraine is gone. It's my miracle.",10
"March 18, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"So last night I felt a migraine coming on in the back of my head . I took my dosage of 50 miligrams and fell fast asleep no side effects. Woke up feeling refreshed . I had worried , and quickly decided it may be different for others as to the reviews I have read .",10
"January 6, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex pills worked for me for a few years but then it stopped being as effective and I had to take 2...  Then that stopped working so I tried Imitrex statdose (the injections) and they work wonders.  They hurt a lot but the pain in my leg after I give it to myself is far less horrible than the migraine pain!  I give myself the shot and lie down for about 15 minutes and I'm fine!  Maybe a little pain but I feel much better!  I'm also on Timolol, Neurontin, and Cymbalta and my migraines have reduced in number and then this helps when I get them.  And the shot works after you've had the migraine for a while - you don't have to take it at the first sign to get relief.",10
"November 25, 2013",,For Migraine:,I have suffered from migraines since I was 16 and been put on several different medications. Right now I have been taking Topamax for over 4 yrs. and it has gotten to where it isn't working anymore. So my doctor gave me Imitrex injections. And they work wonders in getting rid of my headaches but the pain in my chest like something is reaching inside my chest and squeezing the life out of me and the heaviness and tingling sensations lasts for about 15-20 mins. ,9
"April 9, 2016",Taken for less than 1 month,For Cluster Headaches:,"I first experienced cluster headaches at age 18 in the spring, several times a day for about a month, just suffered through with OTC pain meds which did nothing. Finally got to see a neurologist in my 30s who was awesome, diagnosed as classic cluster headache, got on verapamil prophilaxis (80mg x3/day) which I take when ""shadows"" start coming, also oxygen (10-12L/min) for aborting attack. This has been working but if start oxygen too late then attack progresses. I tried sumatriptan injection for the first time when oxygen failed and attack was in full swing, tried sumatryptan injection (6mg s.c.)...amazing, all symptoms were gone within 10minutes!! I will keep trying the oxygen, but will definitely use sumatryptan as back-up!",9
"June 4, 2016",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Imitrex has been a life saver for me. As soon as I feel the headache coming I can take half of a 100mg imitrex and in 20 min the headache subsides. I have absolutely no side effects from this medication.,10
"December 2, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I tried it today cause I’ve been getting really bad migraines and I tried it expecting it to work but instead I got bad side effects neck is tighten and I also have a severe migraine really disappointed and going to speak to my doctor about finding me something else never taking it again...,3
"January 29, 2016",,For Cluster Headaches:,I've suffer from cluster migraine on and off for 10 years. They last about 1-3 hours everyday for 30-40 day  and this happens usually once sometimes twice a year.  When they first started doctors really didn't tell me much they about then 5 years ago I seen a new doctor he prescribe me  Sumatriptan nasal spray it get rid of them in 10-20 min. I can not say enough good things about this drug it's really helped he get on with everyday life,10
"November 1, 2019",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"I have used sumatriptan injections for at least 4 years. I suffer from chronic migraine and occasional cluster headaches. If caught early the injections work well. They are especially good if you are physically sick during a migraine and cannot keep oral medication down. I find them unpleasant to take and my headache intensifies for several minutes after administration. Now that I have been on them for so long they aren’t as effective as they were and the headache usually dulls rather than disappears, I also often have to take two for the same migraine. I haven’t found anything else that works as well however. I am lucky living in Scotland where prescriptions are free but am aware these injections can be expensive.",9
"November 5, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I have been suffering from migraines for over 20 years. My migraines are hormonal but also stress related. First time I took sumatriptan I couldn't believe how effective it was. My migraine disappeared in only 15 minutes and I was able to live my life as a ""normal"" person instead of lying on bed all day. Unfortunately the magic only lasted a few times. I realised every time I had a migraine it took longer and longer for the drug to act. And also my migraines were more frequent since I began using sumatriptan. 
I stopped taking this triptan and my doctor suggested another one (zolmitriptan) which is working really well for me and I only have 1 migraine per month now.",4
"July 10, 2019",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"I started getting migraines when I went on birth control in high school, about 3-10 a year which completely debilitated me. I’m 26 now, and despite having told past physicians that OTC meds did nothing to quell them, I was only prescribed this about a month ago. I had my first migraine since being prescribed just today, and I have to tell you I am so grateful for this medicine! Despite the directions saying to take it when you felt the headache, I went ahead and took it at the close of my aura, when I usually would take my Excedrin. After about 30 minutes I noticed the pain was receding, but I decided to nap a little to make sure I wasn’t imagining it. I woke up after my 30 minute nap but was immediately sick and had to run to the bathroom. I normally experience severe nausea with my migraines, so I was afraid it hadn’t worked, but felt extraordinarily migraine free. I would give it a full 10 if not for the vomiting, but that side effect is so worth it.",9
"March 3, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I started sumatriptan about a month ago. My first time the headache didn’t necessarily go away but it stopped it from getting bigger. It also helped it last only 2 days instead of my normal 3 day migraine. The second time was actually horrible. I felt like I was drugged, dizzy, nausea, chest pain, fingers and arms felt numb etc. my heart was beating out of control and it knocked me out for a good 6 hours. When I woke up the headache was gone but then a small one came back about 30 min later. So that has been my experience the last couple of times taking it. I’m extremely scared to take it on days I have work because the symptoms are super unpredictable. I’ll be trying it a couple more times but I definitely have mixed reviews.",4
"April 25, 2015",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I can't believe all the great ratings for this. Maybe my skin is just extremely sensitive, but this was the most painful injection I've ever had in my entire life. I choose though over belly, and I actually screamed so loudly I'm sure I scared everyone in the reception area. I was not at all prepared for it to hurt as much as it did. The unexpected sharp pain only made my headache worse, and even paired with a shot of Demerol my headache did not clear.",1
"May 3, 2015",,For Migraine:,Before taking the medication I had debilitating headaches which are horrible to begin with but adding 3 kids under the age of 6 it's a nightmare. Ever since I began taking them I'm function again within 30-40 mins. LIFE SAVER!!!,10
"February 20, 2021",,For Migraine:,"I took Sumatriptan once last month and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had. It did not get rid of my migraine at all and on top of a raging Migraine I felt shaky, anxious, had chest pain, I had a hard time breathing right, had tingling sensations in my fingers, felt incredibly weak, hot, nauseas and had diarrhea. I tried to eat something to see if that would help but I had such a hard time swallowing. It was just awful.",1
"March 26, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,For Cluster Headaches:,"I have been a cluster headache suffer for 25 years.....My Dad suffers as well....I remember him sitting in a chair day after day, night after night with no real relief. I never could understand or know how intense the attacks were until I started with mine...lucky my dad was prescribed Imitrex in the 90's at the beginning of mine... his words and mine are that this drug is a god send for us suffers.......My issue is now my insurance company will only approve 2 boxes of shots (4) per month. So my only way is to stock pile these 2 boxes every month until my next attack....well I'm out and now I wiil use coupons or any other way to purchase these on my own to try to save $ ...Sad UHC will not approve the number of shots needed for each episode",10
"March 2, 2011",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I'm 54 years old and have used Imitrex for almost 20 years. No side effects except leg pain for about 24 hours, as if I overused in a workout. Was on 100 mg tabs for a long time, with 3 mg self-injections as necessary. Now just taking 50 mg as I get fewer and less intense headaches now. This medicine is worth trying, but ask for EKG first if the doctor doesn't order it, this can help check for heart okay first.",10
"November 30, 2012",Taken for 1 to 6 months,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex is the best medication for migraines I have taken so far. When I first started using it I would get the loopy feeling and slight dizziness. Normal right? But after a month or two and a few more uses of this medication, I started get a burning sensation in my head, behind my eyes and progressively got worse with each time I took it. The side effects have gotten so bad that now I get cold/hot sweats, the burning sensation in my head, and vomiting. I have now switched to a medication that is the prescription strength of Motrin which works just as well.",6
"October 9, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,I've been a migraine sufferer since I was 10 years old. My Dr prescribed sumatriptan 2 years ago and honestly now I can't live without it I take one tablet and within 20 mins the migraine is completely gone. Side effects for me are hot flushes for a few hrs and I have really achy heavy joints the next day anybody else get these side effects?,9
"October 12, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"So far this medications does help but it makes me very sleepy. Generally when I get a bad migraine its debilitating. I usually leave work and in bed for the rest of the day. So far I've taken this medication twice and it helps rid the migraine and/or lessens it to a dull headache, then I need to rest, stay hydrated, no lights, noise or strong smells",7
"July 15, 2019",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"I am 25 years old and have been getting migraines since my early teens.  I get 2 or 3 per month, lasting up to 3 days at a time.  This is the first prescription drug I’ve tried for them, and I think the good might BARELY outweigh the bad. My headache is typically gone within an hour, but I experience some pretty awful side effects. My shoulders, arms and legs get very weak (similar to flu cramps/ weakness) , my tongue gets very heavy and it’s hard to speak, the nausea is sometimes worse than it is when I have a migraine without medication, and I get very drowsy for a few hours after taking it. Unfortunately, when untreated, my migraines have lasted multiple days. The fact that the headache is gone so quickly is the only reason I haven’t given up on this.",5
"December 28, 2012",,For Migraine:,"This medicine has changed my life: it is a 100% surefire defense against debilitating migraines.  I can actually feel it pushing the headache out of my head. One word of caution, however: in the rare instance I feel a headache coming on and don't have my meds with me (or, more likely, am out of them since the insurance allows only a 9-pill script), the headache that I do get is OFF THE CHARTS.  It's almost like the migraine monster knows I have no defense.",10
"November 29, 2016",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I've been suffering with migraine for 40 years. Tried everything on the market, including acupuncture. Used imitrex needle injections for many years. Learned about sumavel dosepro a few years ago. Loved this script. Very good success with it. However, in the past few months, I have had 12 injections not fire off. 15 or 20 minutes after my attempts, the cartridges fired off on my counter.  Some never fired off and the medicine remained in the injector. I contacted Endo and they were helpful. Took the information and sent a postage paid envelope to return the defective injections to some lab in California. Endo forwarded info to my insurance company for replacements. Surprise, I'm still waiting for these replacements. Getting nowhere.",9
"May 2, 2019",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I've had headaches, seemingly every day since puberty.  I just turned 45.  Normally, the headaches are very low grade and tolerable.  Last year, they became debilitating.  I described my headaches and was asked if I was ever told I have migraines.  Nope, lol *sigh*

The Dr. first tried a blocker (two shots to the back of my head).  I slept for 16 hours a day for a month, and it didn't do a thing for my headaches.

Then I was placed on Sumatriptan Succinate 50mg when required.  I was surprised when I found myself with an abundance of energy (which has since dropped a lot, but it doesn't knock me out as others have complained).

My problem now is with insurance.  They only approved 18 pills for a month.  I told my Dr, so he increased the mg to 100 and told me to break it in half.  When I picked them up, I was only approved for 9.  What the heck?",8
"March 21, 2012",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I tried Sumavel Dosepro for the first time approximately 3 months ago.  It does take away about 80-90% of the headache pain, but am left with a ""sinus"" feeling  headache that really hurts when I cough, sneeze or bend over, which is typical for me for a day after a migraine.  The injection sting feels a little like being snapped by a rubber band.  It didn't feel extremely painful to me. I do get a fairly intense burning sensation mostly along my scalp but to a lesser degree across the surface of my skin as well. My arms feel very heavy and it was frightening at first.  My biggest problem is that I get intensely sleepy and for about 20 minutes I feel like I'm operating in ""slow motion"".",8
"March 16, 2017",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,For Migraine:,"Finally, something non-addictive that actually treats my migraines!
I take this with an aleve and I usually get relief within an hour, and the relief lasts a few hours (about 8)
Only downside is that it makes you really drowsy, and it makes you feel like ""blah"" for a few days  after you take it, but it's totally worth it in my opinion

Also, I feel safe taking it since it's the only option my doctor had that doesn't have any warning about possible addiction.",9
"January 16, 2015",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I've had migraines as young as 11 years old. It was horrible every time I got one. I was too young to understand that it was a migraine. At last when I was 17 years old I began reading more about migraines and knew that I had them. The first time ever taking Sumatriptan succinate I felt so relieved and almost migraine free. Sometimes I feel tenderness in my jaw and neck, but after 30 mins I feel great.",9
"August 20, 2014",,For Migraine:,"I have had migraines since my late teens. I used to take Fiornal, but discovered Imitrex which has been a life saver. I get migraines with aura, followed by pain. I use the nasal Imitrex and I find that if I take Imitrex at the onset of my vision loss, I am usually able to stop the vision problem as well as stop the migraine within 30 minutes. This medication has been a lifesaver for me. The only side effect with the nasal spray for me is that it tastes HORRIBLE in the back of my throat and it makes me a bit sickly feeling, but all in all, I'd rather have it than not.",9
"December 23, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Imitrex is a wonderful medication! I have had hormone-related migraines for a few years now, and while NSAIDs would shorten them, they wouldn't eliminate them completely. I only had to take a 25 mg Imitrex pill and rest for a little bit, and my headache was gone within an hour or so! The only side effects I may have experienced were a slight ache around my forehead and jaw as the headache was fading and a little bit of feeling ""out there"", though these feelings could have been due to the migraine itself. Overall, I would highly recommend this medication and am very grateful to its makers!",10
"January 18, 2021",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"Have cluster headaches for 20 years starting in my late 40’s. Longest period 18 months, one a day and longest period without as Nov 2019 to Nov 2020, then boom back again to this day. Now take Verapamil 3 times day and when cluster comes on use Imitrex nasal spray...quickly reduces pain level and generally headaches gone in about 15 to 20 minutes..lucky that between my insurance and provincial govt , cost is covered...definitely recommend trying",10
"October 11, 2011",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"17 year migrainer. Hands down this is the best overall migraine abortive.  I have used for over 1 year, and 90% of the time it takes 85% of the migraine away. Biggest plus is no needle- the sensation feels like a rubber band snap. My other abortive is Treximet 85/500, and Topamax 100mg daily for preventative.",9
"November 10, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,Thank God for Imitrex. The first tablet I took stopped the headache and didn't have any side effects the first time. The next time I took it I felt shaky. The only side effect that I get from Imitrex is jaw pain. But at least my migraines are no longer in my back. Just make sure that if you are needing two 100mg tablets a day for several days in a row and you still aren't getting relief. Consider a preventive or have a backup. I don't have nearly as many headaches anymore.,6
"June 10, 2016",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"The medication itself works which is the only positive thing I can say.   This ""needleless"" injection is so much more painful than any needle I've ever experienced.  I'll be going back to real injections.  My leg is still throbbing in pain 30 minutes later and it took over 5 minutes to stop the bleeding!   I've never had pain or bleeding with an Imitrex shot through a hypodermic needle.  Who would choose this?",5
"November 21, 2015",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"My 1st migraine experience at 10yrs old landed me in the emergency room. Finally in my 30s after decades of wasted time, pain & frustration I was introduced to imitrex injections; I call this the miracle drug. I'm fortunate to have medical coverage.  The weather (mainly) affects my migraines. I also work a stressful job with shift work. I'm now 44 and although I still attempt prevention and alternative methods Nothing cures my migraines except the injections.",
"September 23, 2018",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"This does wonders although at rare times it doesn’t do much so I have to add an Advil or double dose it (I take 50mg so I take another to make 100mg) I use it mostly for my migraines during that time of the month. I shouldn’t say this either but it works for  migraines induced by hangovers too.....once in a blue moon when I been drinking at a wedding, etc. works in 30 minutes tops. Pain goes away but my face and body often feel heavy and stiff but I found out it’s a common side effect. So overall a good migraine solution.",8
"May 6, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This medicine works great for my migraine headaches. I experience drowsiness and a heaviness or tightness in my head and neck, but on minimally. My headaches are usually gone within an hour or two. Sometimes the drowsiness is nice because it helps me sleep through the pain. I would definitely recommend this product.",9
"June 16, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I had migraines years ago and they were debilitating.  I had to be alone in a dark room.  I had trouble remembering my own name.  It was as if I had had a stoke.  Eventually I seem to have outgrown them.

I suspect some people label bad headaches, ""migraines,"" when they aren't.  My wife has CFS and has serious, real, migraines about once a week.  Imitrex is nothing short of a miracle medication for her.  Nothing else helps.  

The main negative is the cost - about $250 for a box of about six nasal sprayers.  She will use four to defeat one headache.  Insurance only pays for two boxes a month, and she needs at least three.  With co-pays, we end up spending about $300 a month on Imitrex. ",10
"September 26, 2020",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"I have to take sumatriptan for my cluster headache but wish I didn’t, the side effects are horrendous.
I have to take it in bed otherwise I’d never be strong enough to get into bed. As soon as I take the injection I start having chest pains and pounding on my chest then I get complete weakness of legs and arms and start feeling tightness of my hands. I feel like I will throw up and go all sweaty, the only thing I can do is try to sleep straight away so I sleep through the symptoms while people keep checking on me.
The thing is with all these horrendous side effects it’s still a million times worth it to stop the pain of a cluster headache! So have to take them. Just be very careful and make sure someone is with you when you take them, if the symptoms are too bad go straight to the doctors or a & e.",2
"May 26, 2016",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Zecuity (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have suffered from migraine since my early 20's.  I am now 50 years old and for the past year; have suffered from daily migraine with very limited effect from Botox therapy. I saw the ad for this new patch (having been on everything in the migraine market) and asked my specialists to try it. It looks invasive but was easy to use.  I activated the red LED button, after making sure it was sealed good to my arm.  My doctor said I would have prickliness at first. But I didn't experience that every time; and when I did it would only last about 10 minutes. I did get the redness, but that was my only side effect and it faded daily but took about a week to completely disappear. I had no migraine within 30 minutes and no hang over!!!",
"March 10, 2016",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I've been experiencing migraines ever since I was around 14 or 15. When I went on birth control they started getting a little better except for when I was either really stressed or on my period, both times when they are really bad. I talked to my doctor about it and she put me on imatrex (which I tried for the first time when I was 15 when my sister took it) and it works wonders! It alleviates the headache in about 30-45 minutes. The thing I've noticed that is it's best when you first start to feel a migraine coming on, not when you're migraine is already unbearable. I've also experienced some minor side affects like drowsiness and some minor stomach pains (usually only if i take it on an empty stomach) but other than that I've had no issue",8
"September 3, 2018",,For Cluster Headaches:,"I started experiencing severe gut wrenching migraines out of no where, Jan 2 2018. As if a catastrophic storm had arrived in my head. 9 months later; still here. No infections or inflammation. But where after pulling myself off of steroids, advil became my new friend. After 30 min..alleviated. All I had to do was hold on. Neurologists here I come. I was given 2 choices, in which was Indomethacin and Sumatriptan 50mg tablets (9). As much as my headaches agonize I am scared of the side affects to be frank. Stroke, heart attack and/or symptoms. I ended up taking the indomethacin. It is 2 to 3 steps higher than advil but less riskier. I reach for the Sumatriptan box but at the last minute I pull away. Here's to something else coming along my path that won't give me such horrendous side effects. Until then it's the indomethacin and my friend advil.",1
"October 29, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"While it did make the pain stop, it didn't help the other symptoms I have.  It also left a dull aching pressure in my face, made my chest hurt, and my hair felt as though it was being pulled.  I found out later it is not supposed to be used by people who've had atypical migraines, which I've had.",4
"November 24, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have been using this for years for my migraines. I was on the lower dose until the last 6 months. My dosage was increased because the lower dose quit working for me. I would have to take one, wait 2 hours then take a 2nd one, and most of the time I ended up in the ER for a ""migraine cocktail"" because it wouldn't go away. ANYWAY, after my dosage was increased it worked for me again. I do not have any side effects at all and it does not make me loopy or tired. I can get back to my day within about 30-45 minutes after taking it. I would recommend it!",9
"June 8, 2011",,Sumavel DosePro (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I love this medicine. The only caveat. The difficulty in filling the actual prescription.

"April 15, 2012",,For Cluster Headaches:,"I've had clusters for as long as I can remember ... but they've gotten worse as I've gotten older.  First doc prescribed Frova which didn't help at all, but the most recent doctor I've seen prescribed sumatriptan.  I can't believe how quickly this worked. My headaches usually lasted 3 hours  even after taking 3-4 Aleve.  Sumatriptan has knocked them out in 15 minutes.  I feel a bit jittery after, and have extreme taste sensitivity for a few hours, but it's well worth it.  This medicine is a miracle.",10
"June 19, 2012",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"I take the generic Sumatriptan. This medicine has changed my life. I honestly can't see how I would make it through my days if I didn't have this medicine when a migraine comes along. I get migraines 3-4 times a week. Taking it does have side effects, as most of the time my arms get heavy and tingly. I suggest taking it and then sleeping an hour while it kicks in, but sometimes that is not possible, and you just have to push through it. To me, its worth it and definitely worth trying.",10
"May 7, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,Every time I take this medicine my throat and neck become so tense and sore. I also feel tired and loopy. It does make the migraine better. Currently trying to decide if it's worth the side effects or not. ,4

If not, around 4 to 5 a.m. I awake with a full-blown, blind-in-one-eye migraine and I cannot function for about 12 hours. Later it feels like someone took a baseball bat to my head and it hurts.",10
"August 5, 2009",,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have had migraines since I was 6 years old, they are very strong in my family. I have been using the Imitrex injections since I was 17, I am now 25. I am always amazed at how well the Imitrex works, because I get migraines so often I usually wait until my migraine is pretty bad before taking an injection (You are supposed to take it at the first sign of a migraine but if I did that I would take an injection almost daily). I take the injection, lie down for 30-60 minuted and the migraine is totally gone! Seriously. The only side effects I have are a tingly/tight feeling that lasts 2-3 minutes, and as of the last 3 years a red itchy injection site reaction, that resolves in 2 hours or less.",10
"December 28, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I use Imitrex at the start of my aura, which is usually 20 minutes long and once the aura is gone the headache hits me. I add a Vicodin pill with the Imitrex and usually lay down when and where I can. It seems to work for me. The only side effects I have are a stiff neck and upper back and grogginess for a day or two. I keep Imitrex in my car, at work, the boat and my golf bag.",8
"November 3, 2017",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"This is the only Rx that will get rid of my migraines thus far , but it has painful side effects.  I stumbled across the antioxidant drink called BAÍ (Justin Timberlake and Christopher Walken do a commercial for it) and it literally takes away the side effects so I'm not in pain or knocked our for the 4 hours it takes to get through my system.  You take the pill with the Baí and slowly sip on it.  As soon as you feel an ache take another drink.  I have no idea why it works, but it does.

"September 21, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"If you can stand the burning sensation, then its all worth it. It's the only thing that helps my migraines. I used to get them for days on end and I don't get them so often anymore, I also add a trip to the chiropractor as well.",10
"December 14, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have used Imitrex by autoinjection since it first came out. After years of migraine taking my day away, this tiny injection allows me to take it back.  Unlike the other medicines I take this at first onset and 30-35 min later continue my day on schedule.  No nap, no regrets, no nausea.  After initial prescription met with the manufacturers rep who helped with dosing.  I was pioneering any new products when this came out.  Wegmans Pharmacist and my MD and the drug rep were great help.  Now 2 shots, 1 in each leg right away. I'm 220 lbs.",10
"May 19, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,For Cluster Headaches:,"My experience with generic imitrex has been bad.

"March 24, 2017",Taken for less than 1 month,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"This worked really well. I've taken the pills and they don't do anything for my chronic migraines. I did experience some mild tingling in my limbs a few minutes after and a weird warm, flushing feeling in my chest. The warm, flushing feeling in my chest came almost immediately after the injection. It didn't last long and my heartbeat was normal. At least, it felt normal.

Minor pain at injection site but no biggie. Overall, this little pen saved my work day and killed what usually would be a 24-48hr migraine and ordeal!",8
"July 1, 2010",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I have used both the pill and the injection form of Imitrex and they are both amazing!  The first time I was given a shot was in the walk-in clinic the first time I had a migraine.  After a very weird initial sensation of kind of a ""buzz"" I could actually feel the headache dissipating!  The pill form works just as well, but like some other reviewers stated, it does work best if you can lay down for a while.",10
"April 11, 2017",,For Migraine:,"I'm 18 and my doctor prescribed me this because I suffer from constant headaches/migraines.

I won't be taking these again.",3
"April 3, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I have had headaches for years and I could not find any medication that would work for me. The doctor put me on Imitrex 50mg and it works great. I get headaches about 4 days a month in the winter but I have huge increase in the summer (normal for migraine suffers) about 14 days. It does have some side effects for me but the benefit is greater than the side effects. I am also on antidepressants and high blood pressure medicine to see if it will lessen my pain. This is a newer treatment and most doctors say that they see an improvement in migraine suffers headaches (less headaches/less pain).,9
"September 19, 2011",,Imitrex Statdose (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Pill form did not work for me but the stat-dose stops the pain within twenty mins most times. Side effects are tightness in chest, weakness in arms but this goes away within an hour or so. Better than that little devil with the big hammer beating the inside of my head. I take it as soon as I feel that I am getting a migraine and not just a common headache. I try not to overuse it as I have a fear it will stop working and it is the only thing that works short of an E.R. visit for Demerol.",9
"November 27, 2011",,For Migraine:,Imitrex has been a life saver for me. I keep a few tablets with me at all times. Imitrex relieves my headaches 100% of the time. It relives my migraines but it also works on all the other types of headaches too. At least for me it does. I usually only need one 50mg tablet but on a rare occasion I will have to take a second tablet 30 to 60 minutes after the first to get relief. I don't know what I'd do without this medicine. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones because I suffer no side effects at all when taking Imitrex.,10

I try my normal thing of IB Profin and a benadryl and if that does not work after a few hours I use Sumavel DosePro and with in 10 minutes, 90 % of the time I am migraine free and ready to go though my day. This works for onsets to walking up with a full blown migraine.",9
"April 29, 2008",,For Migraine:,"Imitrex injection has worked well for me for the past several years, but sometimes it doesn't last more than 3-4 hours and I need a second injection. Pills don't work as well, nasal spray doesn't work at all for me. The only side effects I have are flushing with sweating and some drowsiness. I'm just glad to have it as I get a few migraines a month. I definitely recommend it.",9
"March 15, 2008",,For Migraine:,"Injection WORKS in 7-10 minutes and you can have your life back! Only thing I don't like is the 7-10 minutes.. Hot flashes that can soak your clothing & make your pain a 1000 times more intense. Just wait it out. No more pain, no more loud noises & no more bright lights. I do not like the pill takes too long.",10
"February 15, 2010",,For Migraine:,"I'm a male, aged 24. I have recently started using the nasal spray ""SUMINAT"" containing the drug sumatriptan. It has done wonders to me. I have had no side effects till now and my migraine goes away for months after taking 1-2 doses. I have been suggested to take 1 metered spray in each nostril on onset of headache.
my history: since 2003 till 2007, i have tried disprin, med containing diclofenac sodium, vasograin(worst tablet), voveran tablet, voveran injection on hip(instant relief). but my migraine got resistant to these with time. 

I strongly recommend to try the drug sumatriptan.",10
"June 6, 2009",,For Migraine:,I have been a sufferer from what was thought to be very bad headache 'attacks' but as I later began to doubt this I was told by my GP that my headaches could actually be migraine attacks. I was given sumatriptan tablets to see if this would help in combating the onset of my headaches and stop them all together and not just preventing a headache from developing into a migraine. I used to suffer from full blown migraines from time to time (once or twice a month) and less severe attacks in between. Now as soon as I begin to feel any kind of eye or neck strain or light sensitivity I know am going to be okay. Ask your GP about Sumatriptan medication. Highly recommended,10
"February 9, 2015",Taken for less than 1 month,For Cluster Headaches:,"I was recently prescribed Imigran, the European version of Imitrex for Acute Cluster Headache, in the injection form pretty much life changing. I'd previously tried Oral Sumatriptan for Cluster Headaches but that just did not seem effective and once a full blown attack had started the pill did not seem to abort the headache. Injectable Sumatriptan though has proved to be a totally different thing and even when the pain is at its peak, once injected its probably 10 minutes maximum before the headache is gone, totally gone. I've suffered from Cluster Headaches for many years and only wish I'd tried this sooner, for me, it has been just brilliant. Having used it several times now have not had any side effects whatsoever, fantastic.",10
"October 6, 2009",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,I was at work with a migraine and eventually had to leave because I couldn't even do much of anything. I just took an Imitrex about 10=15 minutes ago and already the results are starting to show! Great stuff. The only bad part is that I have to go back into work and finish the shift I had started.,9
"February 8, 2019",,For Migraine:,I'm concerned because the migraines do not react to this medication mostly. I usually have to follow it up once the main part of the pain is gone with an over the counter migraine medicine. I am concerned as another patient said if takin to many of them even though the pain is intense because your  body gets use to them.,5
"July 31, 2015",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Cluster Headaches:,"I've suffered from cluster headaches for the last 3 years since I was diagnosed with a growth on my pineal gland. Nothing worked until I was put under neurology science in York UK. I was put on verapamil tablets and also prednisolone to prevent and sumatriptan as a pain relief when I have an attack. I was close to drilling a hole on the side of my head before I was prescribed these meds. The problem is they are expensive, I am lucky and I have these prescribed under the NHS however they will not prescribe me more than 4 injections per week and sometimes I have these attaches every day sown times twice a day for 2 to 3 weeks.

No luck, second was Imitrex tablets - same thing, nothing except side effects. Then I was tried on stat-dose Imitrex, still nothing. The only thing that's helped with killing my migraines is an ER visit being treated with fluids, Valium to knock me out and Dilaudid or morphine along with Phenergran.",1
"March 20, 2018",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"I have been on this medication for over 5 years. I rated it 9 stars because it did work well to stop my migraine in it's tracks,( within an hour ). I would only take half at a time due to side affects of fatigue and dizziness. HOWEVER, my body became dependent upon it. A few years into starting sumatriptan, I began experiencing almost daily rebound headaches/migraines. For several years I struggled with changing diet, eliminating caffeine, foods, other triggers, and taking all the preventative meds on the market, to no avail. Recently I saw my MD instead of the Nurse practitioner. He advised me that triptans CAN cause rebounds for some people. He changed my meds. After a week, I was back to my usual 1 or 2 migraines a week.",9

The VA refuses to treat my severe pain properly. The VA will only give me NINE pills a month which is not enough. The VA pharmacist told me it is because the medicine is too expensive. None of the codeine medicines work. After eight years with migraines, sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me. What is wrong with the VA staff?  They do not care if I am in severe pain.",9
"April 29, 2018",Taken for 5 to 10 years,For Migraine:,"I take 100mg pill when the feeling of a migraine is coming on and this stops the migraine from getting worse within 30 minutes.  It would take up to 2 hours for the migraine to be completely gone.  I have recently switched to the 25mg nasal spray and found this to be even more effective.  Taken on the onset it stopped the migraine from getting worse within a few minutes and gone in under 1 hour.  I have not experienced any side affects either.  

The only negative thing I would say is not about the drug, but how it is dispensed.  I am only allowed 9 doses a month and some months I have a need for more than this.",10
"March 19, 2018",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"Truly awful experience.  I've been nervous about using this medication but I've taken too much time off of work for migraines so I took a pill this morning before leaving the house.  By the time I got to work, my sinuses and throat were both sore.  Then I got lightheaded, dizzy, and my chest and throat tightened up like I couldn't breathe.  I had to go lie down, praying the side effects would lighten up.  Two hours later, I am now enjoying stiffness in my shoulders and muscle aches throughout my hips and legs on top of everything else.  Sorry, but never, ever again.",2

I have taken everything under the sun recently prescribed the injection pack it is the most successful med I’ve tried but here’s the draw back I can only take two shots per day  so what do I do for the rest of my migraines. My doc painted a bad pic of taking to many shots.  This drug is a tease why can’t someone make this so I can take 4 or 5 a day please",6
"September 16, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"After years of ""sick"" headaches that nothing touched my Dr. prescribed Sumatriptan 100mg.  I resisted taking it until a couple of weeks ago when I finally couldn't stand my headache any longer.  It made me very nauseous  for about an hour then the nausea & my headache were gone.  This morning I had to take it again this time I was nauseous for about 1 1/2 hours & my whole face was sore.  I don't know if it is worth it even if it does get rid of the migraine",8
"August 4, 2018",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"The medication side effects just added to my migraine symptoms, making it an even worse experience, and didn't even relieve me of the migraine for more than a few hours if even that. When I couldn't stand it anymore and asked for a new medication I was given rizatriptan which didn't have as bad of side effects, but still didn't relieve my migraine in the slightest.

"March 17, 2018",,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I was on both Fioricet and this medication in small injection form for almost 15 years, worked well especially since I get the works upon the start of a migraine. Everything from aura to loss of arm and hand motor function to slurred speech. Almost identical to a stroke that clears up after 24 to 48 hours. Only down side was the tightening of the neck and jaw muscles  but other than that it did shorten the migraine length and severity. Now move 10 years later and was dropped off the Imitrex and ended up in the hospital from a car accident and began a severe migraine and was given an Imitrex inhaler and I ended up with bad chest pains and was told to never tried it again.",5

"December 31, 2010",,For Migraine:,I have used Zomig 5mg for years and often one half of a tablet zaps the headache within 15 minutes without any side effects at all.

"March 17, 2017",,Zecuity (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"The medication was amazing. I loved how quickly it worked for my migraines. I get too many a month to use Zecuity exclusively so I saved it for the bad nausea ones. Unfortunately, the second time I used it, the patch burned a hole in my leg. When I called to report it, the company insisted it was just an allergic reaction. I literally had a chunk of skin missing and I still have a scar, several months later. The medication is great but whatever they use to push it through the skin is not good. Obviously, since it has since been recalled. Disposal of all of the materials is ridiculous. I would have driven an hour or two to the nearest speciality pharmacy to not have to deal with the delivery and packaging of the medication.",5

I was so impressed! I was getting too wordy with the review and it cut me off so I'll get to the point. After taking the medication through injection (the pill is SO slow to work for me) my aura was gone in less than 2 minutes and I was able to continue teaching my students throughout the remainder of the school day. I still had a headache and minor side effects like hot flashes, tension in my shoulders, and obviously pain at injection site- but I will take those things over a days long migraine ANY DAY. I am so impressed with this medication. All symptoms were totally gone without even a minute headache by 8pm that evening.",9
"June 1, 2011",,For Migraine:,"This is a MIRACLE medicine for me and is most effective when taken at the onset of a migraine. Within 20 minutes, I can feel the relief setting in. Within an hour, I have no sign of a headache or the usual symptoms of vomiting, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, etc. If I 'deny' that I feel a migraine coming on and take the pill after the headache has progressed, it takes a little longer for the pill to work.  Before this medicine, I had become a prisoner in my own life, not daring to venture far from home. THANK YOU Imitrex for giving me back my life!",10

"August 31, 2012",,For Migraine:,"I recently was diagnosed with Complex Migraine. I feel like I am having some kind of seizure that I am awake for: numbness and facial twitching, slurred speech, ocular pain and all kinds of bizarre visuals. Sumatriptan definitely takes the edge off. It only works if I am already having a severe migraine though, and takes some time to work as well. In addition, I cannot take this medicine if I am at work, because it makes me rather tired. However, it is quite helpful for when I am at home and does significantly reduce the disorienting pain and eye pressure. It does not make aura disappear but it makes it less bright. Not perfect but pretty good!",7
"May 25, 2017",Taken for 10 years or more,For Migraine:,"This was hugely helpful for me when my doctor figured out that I was suffering from migraines.

If I lose a dose to emesis, I'll take another with a small amount of water and wait for everything to calm down. Keeps me functional, where before I'd have been wiped out and wishing for death for a day or more. Side effects for me have been very mild and occasional.

Gave up and started with Relpax.  My insurance wouldn’t help so it was $115 for 6.   Then my dr had me try 50 mg Sumpitriptan ( generic imitrex) and very inexpensive.    Always works within an hour and normally my migraines last 36 hours on any OTC med.   I can’t take more than 2 doses in a 5 day stretch or I’m up for days with leg cramps tho.  In desperation, I’ve started Topomax 50 mg as preventative but it’s about 20% effective and not worth the side effects for me ( lack of focus; numbness; tired).",10

Wait half an hour & you wouldn’t know you’ve had a migraine. My life line. A relative also uses sumatriptan & swears by the drug. 50 mg is too low a dose.,10
"July 14, 2016",,For Migraine:,"I'd taken Excedrin for years w/some effectiveness & then had a streak where  headaches would return within a day and sought medical attention.  An urgent care doctor prescribed Bubalbital-APAP-Caffeine and I used it as needed for about a year and was happy with the results, but the prescription was running out.  Because the medication was prescribed by an urgent care doctor the prescription couldn't be refilled, so I had to see an internal medicine doctor and he prescribed Sumatriptan.  After taking the medicine today it did eventually take away my visual auras and it seems to block the full on migraine, but I feel kind of crummy with sinus drainage and pressure, grogginess and slight nausea.  Going to try w/pain reliever Naproxen.",5
"January 23, 2022",Taken for less than 1 month,For Migraine:,"Definitely use this drug with CAUTION. If you are someone who tends to have sensitivities to drugs and often experience side effects from things, be wary of this one. My side effects were much worse than the headache itself. I had horrible muscle aches in neck and head for 2 hours and then threw up violently even though the headache was gone. Please ask your doctor about alternative options to this.",3
"September 13, 2021",Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Migraine:,"I have chronic daily headaches with 5 day intermittent migraines. I am currently unable to work. I saw a neurologist and got an MRI. Luckily there is nothing serious. Mine is muscle spasms in my neck that travel to my head. This medication works well and is cheap. My doctor days it can cause heart issues and wants me to take a $100 per pill script that my insurance won't cover. I moderate my diet and lifestyle, use cannabis products-legal in my state, and try only to use this drug for extreme headaches. I use excedrin and cannabis vape or gummies for muscle tension and moderate headaches. Also stopped drinking coffee and eating pesticides. Just saying. Its holistic. Don't obsess about stressful things past/future. It is all related. Yoga stretching helps too upper back, neck, and shoulders. I like this drug but use it sparingly.",10
"December 18, 2012",Taken for 2 to 5 years,For Migraine:,"I started off using the pills, but if my migraine had already made me vomit, the pills would not work. I have now switched to the injection and highly recommend it! I can feel the relief in minutes. I feel a little fuzzy and need to lay down right after injection. The sleep is much needed and I wake up pain free and no side effects. The injection does hurt a little, but nothing compared to the pain of a migraine.",10
"November 22, 2021",Taken for 1 to 2 years,For Migraine:,"I get headaches about 3 times a week.  My doctor diagnosed me having migraine.  Sumatriptan works very well for me.  My headache is normally gone in 30 minutes.  And I only take 50 MG as I only way about 150 pounds.  I usually take it if I am having a headache late in the day or in the middle of the night. It seems to help me sleep too.  My concern with Sumatriptan is its effect on my blood vessels.  Heart disease is very prominent in my family, so I worry about stroke and heart attack. For that reason I do not take it if I have a headache first thing in the morning or early in the day. If I have a headache in the morning I take one Excedrin for migraine as I do like to work out first thing in the morning. It usually works well, but not as well as the Sumatriptan for me. Unfortunately Excedrin seems to cause rebound headaches. Probably from the caffeine.  My bottom line is Sumatriptan is my go to medication.  I am just careful about any strenuous activity after taking it.",10
"August 15, 2021",Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"Like several was confused for a while thinking migraines were sinus or ear infections, first sign is ear pain for me.  Have gotten worse as I hit 50 and entering perimenopause.  Really struggled with 48 hour long pain vomiting till OB prescribed Imitrex.  Like others if I wait too long it’s benefit isn’t as great as when I take it at the first sign.  I don’t know about the rebound headaches as my migraines are so bad my headaches for days later and am foggy for a few days.  Imitrex maybe makes me a little spacey, but far more functional than with a migraine!!  And the side effects are shorter than when I have a migraine.",9
"June 18, 2016",,For Migraine:,"I actually had zero problems with this medication. It made me sleepy but I did take it at night (when my headache first occurred). I also take a low dosage of Zoloft. Not sure if that helped curve side effects as the doctor did tell me it could cause SHORT TERM (1 hour)  heart attack symptoms/bubble in throat. I had hot flashes but I already have them so I can't say sumatriptan was to blame. My insurance paid for 9 tablets a month, I get 50mg oral.",9
"January 8, 2022",Taken for 10 years or more,Imitrex (sumatriptan) for Migraine:,"I’ve had migraines since my 20’s- I’m 63 now! Imitrex has been a lifesaver for me. I take 100mg at the onset of migraine. Don’t wait until it’s full blown!
 I also use Imitrex injection in emergencies. Like waking up with a #10 migraine and I don’t want to wait at least an hour for relief. I’m terrified of needles, but the quick relief is worth it. Plus, it’s an auto-injector, you never see the needle- just press the button. I do notice I feel more side effects than with the pill.
 Rebound headaches are very possible if you take it too often.
I would have missed out on so much life without it.",9
