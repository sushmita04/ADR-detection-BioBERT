,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've tried almost all meds for depression/bipolar but no success. I started Lamictal 25mg about 4 weeks ago and I'm currently on 50mg per day. It has really lifted my depression. It's the best medication I have ever taken for bipolar. I have more energy, less irritable, less appetite and increased sexual desire. However, it has some side effects (insomnia, nausea, mild constipation and pains on my sides) which are all gradually fading away. I also take 40 mg Prozac per day. Lamictal is a wonder drug. I haven't reached the therapeutic level. I'm titrating slowly. I felt a great need to do this review to help others because other people reviews have helped me in the past. Good Luck and God bless.",8
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I have been on this drug Lamictal total time of 14 months. I've been able to drop my Bipolar  meds down from 4 different kinds to just lamictal only for four months now. My experience is one for the books. Diagnosed with bipolar I had tried so many different kinds of medications. My medicine cabinet looked like a freaking pharmacy. Now I am down to one drug a day! That drug is lamictal!!!! Literally my saving grace. All the psychiatrist I saw. All the different medication combinations I had tried only scratched the surface. My newest psychiatrist suggested this drug. I was skeptical because none of the other Drs I saw suggested it and I didn't know it existed. This drug is a miracle.... It has changed how I live. How I care for my kids. How I see the world. The best part is I'm me again.,9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Male, 33 years old. I've been on Lamictal for 4 months after diagnosed with cyclothymia. Started with 50 mg, now 100 mg once a day. Mood swings all my life, often irritable, easily became angry. Spent $$, got into debts massively, never worked at one place for more than a few months.
  Lucky to find the right psychiatrist who put me on Lamictal. In my country (Russia) not many docs are familiar with bipolar spectrum disorders treatment and even less prescribe Lamictal.
 After taking the first 50 mg everything changed immediately. I became calmer, more stable, feel much more comfortable in public places and in communication with people, more confident, more present, more relaxed. Before I had a feeling that everyone around is constantly looking at me and even judging, couldn't talk by phone if someone is near me. Although my highs are still a bit too high, my lows are 80 % better.  Surely, I'm going to continue taking Lamictal.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I had been empty, depressed doesn’t justify the way I was living my life. No matter how hard I tried, what medication I took. I couldn’t mom, House a MESS, relationships failing, Job on the line, alcohol being my go to.

I started lamictal about 2 months ago and haven’t had one day where I felt like I couldn’t make it through. I got a promotion, my laundry is done at all times, dishes washed, cooking dinner on the regular, I can get out of bed on Sundays which was a routine for years. 

Lamictal was my miracle for bipolar depression. Easy to say without it, I don’t know if I would be here.

Now I WANT to be here, I want to succeed, self develop. Started reading self help books, listening to motivational podcasts.

If you feel like there is nothing that will help you  I highly recommend taking a chance on lamictal.
After all, when you have bipolar depression, what do you really have to lose??

DO IT.",10
Kate,"June 4, 2020",For Anxiety:,"I never review meds but I feel like I’m doing a disservice but not sharing. SO PLEASE READ! I was prescribed lamotrigine at my lowest point. I was struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression and PMMD. I was facing constant intrusive thoughts about death and sadness.
I came home from the doctors after being prescribed and read these reviews and bawled my eyes out. I was so afraid of taking this medication. Yet, I needed something to help ASAP. 

I have now been taking lamotrigine for 3 months and my anxiety is much lower, my emotions are not out of control before my period and I have more peace of mind. 

I don’t have any bad side affects. My biggest recommendation is to start with a low dose (50mg) and after two weeks (100mg). I feel like taking more than this ups your chance of having a bad reaction. We are all different so there is no guarantee. Just know that this website is usual used if you have had a relatively bad experience so take that into consideration.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I’ve taken this drug Lamictal for about 7 weeks now and guess what? My life has turned so positive! I am a way happier and stable human. I no longer lash out or get mad over any little thing that would trigger a manic stage. I’ve been able to deal with stress without  freaking out, literally can't believe it! I highly recommend this to anyone with bipolar!!!! Good luck and God bless",10
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I am a person that never writes reviews, however, if I can help just one person from feeling the way I used to feel—it’s beyond worth it. 
My entire life I felt different, as if I was experiencing the world entirely different than most everyone else—funny thing is, I actually was. After trying numerous medications for ADHD, and severe depression/anxiety, I was finally given the option of Lamictil as a last resort. And let me tell you, after being on it for two months I haven’t been this happy since I was a child.
To everyone suffering from BPD or Bipolar disorder, THIS STUFF WORKS! Please give it a try and you will feel the transformation after a month of two. There IS help and I pray that each and everyone of you likeminded people get the aid you need. Thanks to god, Lamictil, and my doctor for setting me free of the misery that was my life. God bless you all, much love.",10
CJ,"September 25, 2020",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I was put on lamictal for Borderline Personality Disorder/PTSD/Anxiety/Major Depressive.  The only noticeable side effects for me were slight irritability and becoming more easily frustrated than usual in the beginning, along with drowsiness after taking the nightly dose. I can honestly say that after working out the kinks, this medication has changed my life. I have more energy, I sleep better, and I am able to let go of less than ideal situations instead of being consumed by them. I no longer default to self harm and suicidal ideation, and my thoughts are much less hyperbolic and more aware/rooted in reality. I cannot remember the last time I was this stable and happy. I have not experienced any rashes or physical changes other than my appetite slightly decreasing and losing a bit of weight. 150mg is definitely the sweet spot for me and I do not intend to increase my dose at this time. I would highly recommend this medication, especially if you are like me and have exhausted every other option.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal has completely changed my life. I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify— a pretty high dose— and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects— I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related. It’s really been a miracle drug for me.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Ok, so I've been on several different antidepressants and antipsychotics to no avail. When my Doctor suggested lamictal I thought ok, here we go again..... well I just want to say I've been on 25mg for 2 weeks and just upped the dose to 50mg 2 days ago. I honestly feel so much better. She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope. I don't want to die every second of the day. The only other Medication I take is Ativan as needed. Don't give up! I can't believe this is actually working!!!",7
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Have successfully managed my bi polar since 1999 with Lamictal. On 400 mg/day for last 10 years. The only issues sometimes get dizzy on step ladder (I avoid) blurry vision late night, a little flat, increased sex drive. I went undiagnosed for 35 years. This drug has saved my life! I’ll take a little flat over crying for days at a time or 5 days straight, no sleep, cooking and repainting and redecorating 3 rooms in the house. In those 5 days. That including DIY furniture and window treatments and yes, spending $ I didn’t have! I have several businesses, cash in bank, bills paid, fairly reg sleep. Lamictal saved my life after my divorce 21 yrs ago.",10
Sb123,"October 25, 2019",For Anxiety:,"I have struggled with anxiety off and on over the years. I tried SSRI’s in the past and those never gave me much of any relief. I got to a point where I was in a downward spiral of anxiety (crazy thoughts, wild mood swings, uneasy digestive issues, sleep issues, etc). I decided to give medicine another shot. My doc prescribed me lamictal and now on 100mg. I am MUCH more stable. I don’t have the crazy intrusive thoughts as much and my perspective on life is much more positive. It did not make me dull or any other negative side effect. It just gradually allowed me to be myself again and enjoy life. Please do know that medication in general can absolutely help. Do not listen to outsiders who do not understand how you feel. Medication is a personal option that you should feel no judgment about. If it helps you then that’s all that matters! It may take awhile to find the right medication for you but it is worth it. Never give up. There is something that will help you.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've struggled undiagnosed with Bipolar2 for years- many times having it labeled and treated as depression (Prozac, Wellbutrin, etc, all of which helped the depression but made me manic).  The one time I was told it could be bipolar 2 at age 25, the diagnosis scared me (the idea of being on medication for the rest of my life did too) so I decided to go off of all meds and ""handle it on my own""

7 years later, after multiple tumultuous relationships, tons of $ spent shopping, and some extreme bouts of both depression and hypomania I finally started on this medication Lamictal.  I have been on it for about 6 weeks and am up to 100mg and I finally know what ""normal"" feels like.. and it's not racing thoughts 24/7 or snapping on loved ones at the drop of a hat.  

Almost no side effects.  ",9
,,For Anxiety:,"I have taken lamotrigine for years with no side effects. It takes approximately 1.5-2 months for lamotrigine to take full effect. Side effects are typically avoided by starting at very low doses (I started at 25 mg once a day) and slowly increasing the dose over time. Taking higher doses too rapidly or without physician consultation increases risks of side effects, and you shouldn't expect to see full results within a couple days or even a couple weeks. I hope this helps someone feel less anxious about trying out this medication and feel more informed! (I am educated on this topic because I'm an MD student.)",10
JJ,"December 22, 2019",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've struggled with bipolar ii since I was a teenager, unfortunately it was misdiagnosed as depression until I was in my 60's. As you can imagine I've been prescribed everything available beginning first with what were called ""tricyclics"" which were medications like Mellaril (thioridazine) Elavil (amitriptyline) to the SSRI's such as Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro Celexa and several others. I took other types of medications for depression or anxiety too many to mention all with varying and limited levels of success some were helpful for a time others not at all that was until I was diagnosed bipolar ii and prescribed lamictal. This medication along with psychotherapy has had a profound effect on my life I have to say I've never felt better",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"When I started taking it I had the worst side effects (dizziness, diarrhea, blured vision, nausea). Some days, I couldn't go to class. I started with 25mg and went all the way to 150mg. But it is really working. I've been taking it for 4 months and I never been this stable in my life. I feel good, better than ever.  I underestimated the illness, but medication is the key. Therapy helps a lot too.",10
,,For Depression:,the first day on  lamitrogine has been an absolute life changer! I was having severe hopeless depression paired with anxiety. My moods seemed to shift from one to another triggered by hormones or stress. It developed into eating disorder over time untreated. I've tried every SSRI and off label blood pressure meds etc. I always have them a good run and they always had a lot of side effects and made my original symptoms worse. Then after research I asked my psychiatrist for lamictal. I had 0 side effects!! I started at a dose of 25mg for 2 weeks and am at the end of 2 weeks on 50mg. I felt the difference by the second week of 25mg and even more at 50mg. I have felt so hopeful and excited at times in perfectly healthy ways and depression and anxiety is all but gone. I don't feel doped up at all just a better version of me than I have ever felt. Also unlike SSRIs this doesn't impact sex drive and if I get pregnant it's safe. Love and plan to stay on it for a long time. It's worth it!,10
,,For Depression:,"Lamictal has changed my life!!! I have had medication resistant depression for over 30 years. I am now 60. Have been on every med out there only to keep from being suicidal at best. Was on abilify for 3 or 4 years with Viibryd. Gained 30 lbs and cholesterol went sky high. So as a last resort decided to try lamictal. I am on 150mg and 30mg of Viibryd. It has totally changed my life. I am no longer depressed at ALL!   My friends and family are amazed at the difference they see in me. I am socializing with people and taking care of myself again. I think I feel better than I did before being diagnosed with depression. Now I know we all react to meds differently but if you are having trouble finding something that works this is worth a try. I have major depression,  not bipolar. I say that because most things I read about using lamictal was to help with bipolar. But it can also help as an add on to your antidepressant. I thank GOD I found out about it.",10
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I was first on topamax for my borderline personality disorder which my body didn’t agree with and almost shut my liver down. I got Wellbutrin XL 150mg, which helped but made me super angry, my doctor then added in Lamictal 100mg (starting from the lowest dose and gradually increasing) and it cancelled out the anger they Wellbutrin caused and the two work phenomenally well  for me. Like a lot of people on here they say they felt the effects immediately, I can vouch for that. It put my brain into a zen state and I got my laid back nature back. Mind you this only worked for me along with seeing a therapist and working out constantly. Medication helps set the bar, but you gotta do the work to get to where you want to be.

I believe in you.",8
J,"March 2, 2021",For Anxiety:,"I started on lamictal as I have bad mood swings, depression, severe anxiety, and  OCD type thoughts. This medication was a life saver, I thought. I started at 25mg and noticed very positive changes. My anxiety got better. When I went to 37.5mg my anxiety stopped, OCD thoughts stopped, depression stopped, I was so happy I thought I found the medication for me. When I went up to 50 mg I got a small rash, my anxiety and thoughts spiralled out of control, my depression worsened, I felt suicidal. Now I am trying to get off the medication. I’m very sad. Has this happened to anyone else?",4
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I am an extremely sensitive person and my depression is easily triggered. I have BPD, PTSD, MDD, and ADD(inattentive). I do not have Bipolar Disorder, but this medication has helped me tremendously with mood swings. I used to have a mental breakdown almost every day from intrusive thoughts. I am feeling much better now. I am taking a low dose of only 25 mg. I request to start on the lowest dose possible of any medication and work my way up. I notice a lot of people are leaving negative reviews because of side effects. I have had no negative side effects and I do not plan to increase my dosage. Remember that the higher the dose you take of any medication, the greater the risk is for side effects. I would recommend giving this medication a chance!",10
Anonymous,"October 2, 2019",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"My whole life I was depressed. I started using drugs at age 16. Which led to a 17 year battle with depression and addiction. It was like no matter where I was my mind would tell me I didn't belong. I've been taking this medicine for a year and a half. It is NOT a coincidence I got sober and haven't picked up a drug since. Its not a coincidence I'm a mom again, a friend and a daughter. This medicine allowed me to breath and swing with the flow of life optimistically. Its mild so its perfect. This medicine saved my life. Literally.",10

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,After struggling off and on with depression this medication Lamictal literally saved my life. I bounced from antidepressant to antidepressants praying something would work but nothing did. I had everything in my life so it was so frustrating. It felt like my soul had been sucked out of me. I no longer wanted to live. This disease cost me a marriage a son and a job. Life is so good now. I owe my life literally to Lamitcal. Please don't ever give up!!!!,10
Kalia,"May 12, 2021",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I start taking lamotrigine 2 month ago, this drug is a life changing !
I had mood swing all the time, they went  10 (from scale 1-10) to only 1.
My brain was speeding and thoughts were running  and now I have clear brain - no crazy thoughts.
Zero sides effects ...only first week of taking I was more thirsty than usual. That’s it.
I can call it magic peel!
Highly recomended.",10
,,For Depression:,"I'm diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and PTSD and have been in a very dark place for months and very depressed and anxious and suicidal thoughts. I'm on several medications for months, Venlafaxine, Wellbutrin and Vyvanse which are little to no help. Lamictal was added and I'm now on 100 mg daily in the morning and my depression is entirely gone and so is my anxiety. I don't get mood swings anymore, I am calmer and less pessimistic. I've had no side effects except some minor itching upon dose increases lasting for a day or so. I don't feel emotionally numb. I just feel like a calmer, more logical, happier version of myself. I've tried so many medications over the years for my depression and anxiety (over 20) and this is the first one to truly help. A miracle medication for me. It can take time to find the right medications for you but don't give up hope.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I’ve been on Lamictal for about 5 months. Before getting on Lamictal, I was at my lowest I’ve ever been mentally. I was barely sleeping, had nasty angry outbursts on a near daily basis, and had suicidal thoughts. It took about 2 months to start seeing a difference but I’m so thankful that I’m on this medication. It changed my life, I feel like myself again. I still get those angry outbursts sometimes but they aren’t as bad. I also haven’t had a suicidal thought since getting on it.",9
,,For Anxiety:,"This made life so much better. I think my doctors prescribed every SSRI and SNRI there is. Each one made me sicker than the last one. A couple of them made me miss weeks of work at a time. I started on such a low dose that it made no difference, I was just happy it didn't make me sick, so I kept taking it. Finally I went up to a full 25mg and I will never forget the first time I felt this stuff kick a panic attack's ass! I literally felt it stuff it down and smother it! 6 months later I'm up to 50mg and on the rare occasion I feel an attack coming on it is never as severe as it used to be. After doing some reading on this med, it is the last resort for anxiety. If You get sick on anti depressants, stop messing around and demand your doctor prescribe this. I was worried that this was a seizure med and was skeptical, it has exceeded expectations. I doubt there is anything that cures anxiety, but lamotrigine sure works for Me.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal changed my life ! I’ve tried many bipolar meds as a teen - trileptal, seroquel , trazadone etc ... none worked and I developed terrible acne and side effects. So I went off bipolar meds and took only Zoloft for almost 10 years . Fast forward - one day I realized I couldn’t get out of bed and needed help. I was insistent on trying a medication that wouldn’t make me gain weight so I read a lot of reviews on here and decided to try Lamictal. It absolutely changed my life - the ONLY bipolar medication that has worked for me. It is like night and day - looking back at my precious behavior is baffling to me now.  Now no blow ups, I can function normally, no weight gain. I noticed a difference literally the day of taking it (I’m very sensitive to medicine and in tune with my body ). Again - this medication changed my life . Thank you Lamictal !!",10
caro,"February 3, 2020",For Anxiety:,"Lamictal completely changed my life. Before I started it, I'd have bursts of anger due to pent up anxiety over the nit-pickiest things. I thought I was just a jerk and didn't understand why.

Quickly after I started taking Lamictal (250mg for anxiety) I noticed a huge difference. I felt relaxed for once. Not euphoric, or like a different person, just... Normal! Calm, collected, but still sharp.

Lamictal was like a valve that drained my anger out when I was just about full of rage.

I personally haven't noticed many side effects, at least none that I don't already have from SSRIs. Loss of coordination is a big one and I only get tremors if I haven't eaten but that might just be low blood sugar.

In conclusion, being someone who suffers from chronic general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, I can definitely see Lamictal being an effective long term medication. Works great for me.",10
,,For Depression:,"I’ve been on Lamotrigine since mid-August. I titrated up slowly and am at maintenance dose of 200mg daily. I was on every depression/anxiety medication you can think of for the past 20 years. I had to wean off those as lamotrigine was introduced. So far it has made a remarkable difference in my moods, my depression, my motivation. I love not laying in bed all day. Going on it was not easy however. My anxiety was high, migraines, fatigue, insomnia. These have resolved but it’s taken 3 months. I’m thrilled at the difference it made in me and pray it continues to work!

After 20+ years struggling to ""cure"" myself ""naturally"" & being miserable, dangerously depressed & dysfunctional, I finally decided to try psych medication.  
I found a doctor who SPECIALISES in this disorder and is up to date with the latest research findings in this specific condition.

I kept a daily mood diary & it took 3 months for my mood to fully stabilise. To help the bipolar depression, we added bupropion & N-Acetyl Cysteine, a supplement (all based on clinical research!).

Now 10 years later I have zero headaches from it and zero side effects. Maybe I am a little less empathetic but I love this med. I have zero depression with maybe 1-2 brief episodes of depression per year. It never lasts and when one starts I may cry and feel really down but I feel it kick in and stop the endless spiral.

I feel more myself than I have in so many years. I still feel things deeply hence unlike some antidepressants which numb you, per my own experience, Lamictal does not.

I understand the epidemic and the risk of addiction, but didn't care.  Went into new Dr. (one that finally didn't just take out a prescription pad and ask me ""what do you want?"", but asked questions to better understand me.  The plan?

,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"Lamictal has 100% changed my life with borderline personality disorder. I am beyond grateful to finally be able to function like a normal human being. I am not lashing out in anger anymore, I can concentrate, I think before I react, I behave rationally and I have patience. I had zero ability to control my reactions before Lamictal. This medication literally saved my life. If you do go on this medication, I must warn you that the change is very dramatic and adjusting to normal is very foreign and scary for a while - especially if you have been this way for a long time. Therapy is an absolute must. Talking through your problems, past and present, learning new coping skills and just having that support will help tremendously. I know you probably feel like it’s impossible to change because it’s all you know, I get it, but life can be good. No matter how many other meds didn’t work, Lamictal might be the answer to your prayers.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have tried and failed every medication out there!! I just could not tolerate the side effects and weight gain. I came very close to suicide and I finally got on lamictal. What a difference!! I am finally not having the mania keeping me up for days and the severe depression of constantly writing suicide letters. I am also on klonopin. I had to go off my meds during my pregnancy and my husband said "" I will never get you pregnant again!!!"" That is how much better I am on the medication. My dose is 300 mg. split twice daily. I had gastric bypass as well and I am tolerating it the same as I was before. I have been on Lamictal for 8 years.I wanted to share my experience so that I might touch someones' life and make a difference!",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have Bipolar Disorder type 2 and when the Pandemic hit my moods became completely unmanageable, especially my anxiety. I had not been on medication for about 4 years which if you have Bipolar disorder can be very dangerous territory. The racing thoughts, the angry outbursts, the never ending panic attacks, crying outbursts, the mania...it was awful. I ended up having to be hospitalized.

I am not someone who is good at taking medicine, I castrophize and make my self suffer unnecessarily. I finally gave in while at the hospital and started Lamictal 25mg twice daily and I'm thankful I did. Within the first 2 days my panic attacks eased, my racing thoughts quieted and I wasn't crying so much. It does make me tired and gave me headaches for about a week, but both are manageable and have lessened. I have had only 1 panic attack since starting Lamictal and it was much less severe than without. This medication works for me.",8
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I felt it necessary to leave a review because of how well this medication has worked for me.

However, I have been quite seriously bipolar (with panic disorder) for over 30 years. As you can imagine I have been on many medications. About two years ago nearly everything had gone wrong in my life - including being homeless and drinking far too much. I pulled out of that with the help of Seroquel. But I was still having really really bad times. Then I met someone who suggested this medication.

Well it was not instant but slowly I started becoming ""normal"". Normal to me is wonderful. Now I hardly drink.. Why - because I drank to cure myself.. I actually wake up and look forward to the day. I feel young again!",10
,,For Anxiety:,"Have been suffering from anxiety, panic and bipolar depression for 20+ years. Have been on every cocktail imaginable and was my best on Klonopin, Remeron and Zyprexa. Zyprexa caused me to gain 60 lbs over 4 years and made my blood sugar crazy. Trying to come off was really awful, I dropped from 10mg to 5mg to 2.5 to 1.25 for months. After several failed attempts trying to cross with Latuda, Abilify and Seroquel, my doctor prescribed Lamictal and it's changed my life completely. My depression is all but gone, my moods are better, anxiety is lower and I've been Zyprexa free for 2 months and lost 19 lbs. I am currently at 50 mg and our goal dosage is 100mg. Took a few days to kick in and getting better by the day. Finally getting my life back!!!!!",10
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"Ok so when I first started taking this medication Lamotrigine for borderline personality disorder I felt really dizzy, slightly sedated, and had nausea. I read a lot of others people reviews saying if you can push past this initial stage your body will adjust to it, and what do you know  it took about six days to get over the initial side effects from lamotrigine. I feel WAY more balanced out, I am not over thinking, and the things that used to worry me or give me anxiety no longer do. I don't hold on to the negative obsessive thoughts like i used to. If something upsets me I am able to take a step back and look at the whole picture without blowing up. I realize it takes 6 weeks to reach full potential but oh my wow must I say I see and feel a difference within myself. I am going to keep taking this medication, as I can see its potential to change my life, the way I feel about myself, the way I feel and interact with others, and my whole outlook on things in general. I am starting to feel normal, and I haven't felt like that in awhile.",9
,,For Anxiety:,I was put on this for severe anxiety 6 weeks ago and it has given me my life back! I can now go in public places without having a breakdown and my family has noticed a huge difference. I’m taking better care of myself and have the energy and desire to walk again. The only downfall is you have to titrate up slowly so you can get discouraged at first thinking it isn’t working. I’m now on 200mg and it’s been a game changer. Don’t give up on this medicine as it is a miracle worker. The only side effects I’ve had is a runny nose and headaches when starting it but I’d take that any day over the crippling anxiety I once had.,10
,,For Depression:,"I believe I’ve been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder. I’ve never had a manic or hypomanic episode. Ever. I was put on 200mg of Lamictal, along with other meds. I feel completely flat and I think it’s the Lamictal. I have no emotions and my motivation is extremely low. I KNOW I love my daughter but I don’t FEEL that love. This is an example of having no emotions. And I hate it. I WANT to feel that love. I want to feel ANYTHING. I’m just flat.",2
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I consider Lamictal to be my miracle drug for borderline personality disorder, it has significantly turned my life around for the better. I'm currently about to have my dose increased to 200mg a day (was 100mg previously), but I already feel more.. 'normal'. I feel like I'm close to becoming the person I'm meant to be, my true self. I had felt blinded, hanging onto the words of loved ones, doing harmful things on impulse, pushing others way. I felt like I was looking at the world through a distorted lens. I'm learning how to be at peace with myself and others thanks to Lamictal. I love it, can't recommend it enough. I hope I'm not the only one with BPD who takes this. :-)",10
,,For Depression:,"I started lamictal during a life upheaval leading to acute, severe depression and after a bad reaction to lexapro (worsening depression and suicidal). Starting at Lamotrigine 25mg within 1 to 2 days I felt immediate relief. I worked up to 75mg and stuck with that for several months. Circumstance lead to worsening depression and went to 150mg once daily and now at 200mg and holding steady. I have stopped years of benzo, Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax. Now only take Lamictal. This medication provides a wall against depressive thoughts, behaviors. Also mood swings and rage issues that I suffered most of my life are almost completely absent. This med has given me a chance to live happily even during times of great change and struggle. Time to time I consider going off, but I'm afraid of relapse. Have been taking 3 years.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I 100% believe I would not be alive today without the Lamictal I take for bipolar. Before Lamictal, being alive was one of the hardest jobs I’d ever been tasked with. Now, because of this drug, I feel like a normal part of society looking forward to living life. This drug showed me how important it is to take your mental health seriously.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have taken many different medications and this is the best and cleanest mood stabilizer. I was on 200mg. I do recommend it to people who are manic and unstable. It will help you get back on your feet and function in life. You will likely notice your mood is flatlined, but if your life is in the dumps then having a flatlined emotion is worth it.  You will not get upset over things that made you upset in the past. Disclaimer: It gave me some short term memory loss, and pounding headaches with hazy vision if I did not take the medicine at the same time everyday. Be careful with alcohol because the hangovers are extreme on this medication.",8
,,For Depression:,"Tried everything from Depakote to Lithium and every antidepressant with them. Finally paired Lamictal (Lamotrigine) with Lexapro (Escitalopram,) and hit the jackpot! I'm Unipolar (severe depressive,) and the 300mg ER Lamotrigine with 20mg Lexapro has kept me totally mood-balanced and low-anxiety. After 20 years of different meds, I finally feel like myself.",10
dmy25,"June 4, 2021",For Depression:,"I’ve been on many SSRI’s and anxiety medications, & this has 100% been the most helpful one I’ve ever taken. I’m diagnosed major depressive, GAD, OCD, PMDD, &  agoraphobic & this medication has saved my life. It’s the first med I’ve taken that had minimal side effects. When I first started I would get a bit of nausea after about an hour & then get really hungry. When I took it after a meal or with a snack it stopped happening. I can’t take it at night because it will give me some crazy dreams so I usually take it around lunch. My anxiety has decreased dramatically, I have a range of emotions now instead of just sad or angry & they’re very even, I’m getting housework done, I’ve stopped waking up in the middle of the night at 3am every night, & I’m enjoying time with my family. If you’ve been prescribed this medication and are nervous, please try it. It is a slow build up so don’t go into it expecting the process to be quick. It’s definitely worth it though.",10
Beemzo,"April 30, 2020",For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have been taking Lamotrigine for over 6 months. I am now at 150 mg. At 100mg or less if was a bit sedating so I took it at night. After reaching 150mg, I got some pretty bad insomnia so I take it in the mornings now. May need a sleeping pill because benzos aren't helping the insomnia.
Before taking lamictal, I've been on over 20 medications for PTSD. Every single one made symptoms of anger, PTSD, depersonalization, and bipolar much worse. With Lamictal, it just doesn't do that. It helps instead of hurts. I used to be too afraid to leave my room to pee. Now I went to a job interview yesterday. I spent 2 years not leaving my house, not eating, not living. I was ready to give up on ever healing. Lamictal hasn't fixed everything for me. No medication can do that. It takes a lot of trial and error, a whole lot of self work, but without Lamictal I don't think I would have even started making changes in my life.",9
,,For Depression:,"This medication saved my life at a time when I was severely suicidal.  I finally feel ""normal"" after 5 years battling MDD and GAD.  Tired citalopram, vibryd, Zoloft, Effexor, Xanax and some others I can't remember.  Tried holistic and homeopathic remedies.  I just kept getting worse and worse.  I have no side effects, my depression and anxiety is completely manageable and I feel like I have my life back.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have Bipolar II and Lamictal  saved me. I was untreated until I was 40 years old and now I feel like a totally new person, open to people and situations that I would have been closed off to before. I was highly volatile, angry, and irrationally irritated all of the time,  depressed, or hypomanic and nonsensical. I am none of those things any more. I am grateful for this drug because I think I wouldn't have made it much longer without it. I wish I had listened to the doctors years ago and tried this. My entire adult life until now has been clouded by this disability, but I am happy to have the chance to try again now.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I went my whole life undiagnosed with symptoms that started at 4 years old.  I’ve suffered everyday. Within 3 days of taking Lamictal my mind was quiet and rational and my body felt as if a soothing balm had spread over my nerves.  
I’m able to focus and concentrate. My anxiety is gone. I could go on and on.  Everything is better. I could not be more grateful. I’ve been on it now for 3 weeks at 50mg and life is good. I don’t ever want to be without it.  If I get a rash I’ll rock a rash because I’m not going back!",10
,,For Anxiety:,"This pill literally changed my life. It took away a lot of social anxiety and a lot of depression. No anti depressants helped me, they all gave me awful side effects. But this pill worked wonders! I take 200mg every night and its the only medication i take. I used to be on 3 different pills but now this pill alone has worked the best! Truly grateful for this pill!",10
Girlchanged,"March 19, 2017",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal saved my life. I have struggled my whole life with rapid cycling bipolar 2, with more frequent and longer lasting depressive episodes than manic. I was just recently diagnosed and never knew what was wrong with me- I've been dealing with this since as early I can remember , around age 10. I started seeing a counsellor and psychiatrist and this is the conclusion they came to. When I started going I was so close to ending my life, it was terrifying . I just thought it was normal. Then my psychiatrist started me on Lamictal and we worked up to 200 mg and I have never been this happy in my ENTIRE LIFE . I've been overweight forever and I'm now losing a lot of weight healthily, I'm so happy and confident and I'm finally making changes.",10
,,For Depression:,"When I first started Lamotrigine, I was having crazy nightmares for for the duration of the ""starter kit"". Once my dose got adjusted to 300mg, the nightmares stopped and I started making progress on getting my life together. I know it's working in some subtle way... At least I can look at nature and appreciate its beauty, again.",8
,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have been taking lamotrigene for a week now. I'm only at 50mg as of now. I have bipolar, severe derealization and depersonalization from PTSD. 

I can tell that things (physical things) are becoming more real. Items are slowly more 3D rather than 2D. My brain has removed the part of reality that allows me to feel a part of life as a coping mechanism for my safety. Whatever this drug is doing I am grateful for it because I believe before this my life was a nightmare. Not being able to connect that reality is physically real. 

I can feel it quieting my intrusive ruminating thoughts which is amazing. In the shower the other day I heard, for the first time, quiet except for the water running and I broke down crying because I never realized how truly loud my thoughts were. 

I still have a ways to go but I do also feel it evening out my moods. I'm not as angry and easily triggered.",10

It begins with a good doctor and being true to yourself to know what works.,9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This drug genuinely saved my life. I'm 25 and have exhibited depressive symptoms for the past 10 years, which is way too long to wait to get properly treated. It took getting on Effexor and experiencing mixed-states/rapid-cycling/suicidal thoughts before I was correctly diagnosed with Bipolar II. I started feeling positive effects on  100 mg Lamictal. I have been stable on 200 mg for a year now, and the only side effects I experienced were fatigue and mildly fragmented sleep the week after increasing dosage. One of Lamictal's bonus effects for me was tamping down my anxiety and panic to almost nothing - this and lifting my omnipresent depression have truly been a life-changer. No side effects now and I am the most happy, productive, and fulfilled I have been in a decade!",10
,,For Anxiety:,"I suffer from severe fibromyalga and an undiagnosed mood disorder, crippling waves of anxiety has always been the most prominent of my symptoms relating to my mental health. I've been on 100 mg of lamotagrine for almost two years now and this drug has been a life saver for me. For the couple of years prior to me going on this medicine my mental health was 
deteriorating, my depression/anxiety was so bad during certain episodes that I'm lucky I didn't harm myself. I ended up in an emergency room ER and was given this drug as an outpatient.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I have been on Lamotrigine for a month now and so far it has changed my life around. With bipolar 2 I suffered a depressive state for over a month and quit my job because it got so bad. I am taking 100mg right now and I have not experienced any adverse side effects except for sleeping longer than usual with vivid dreams. A couple side effects I would consider positive is that I am not constantly hungry anymore and libido has improved so  lovey dovey with my husband all the time. It has also helped reduce my urge of drinking alcohol. This is the best medicine I have ever been on after doctors were treating me with SSRIs for the past 10 years until a new doctor diagnosed me with bipolar 2. A+++ for Lamotrigine.,10
,,For Depression:,"I was telling my doctor about my severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks, ADHD/restlessness and he prescribed me this drug  
 lamotrigine. After 4/5 days of taking it, I had extreme anxiety, could not stand being at work and my thoughts convinced me that if I just drove to the golden gate bridge and finally did it, all my problems would be solved. I have never been actively suicidal, so as I noticed these thoughts I looked it up and apparently its a rare side effect from this drug. That is something my doctor never told me before taking it. IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE!",1

I felt like a failure because the meds wouldn't work. 3 years ago (2016), I walked into a hospital and said I need help, please. I was given a psychiatrist and social worker team from the GODS of heaven. I was FINALLY diagnosed properly and put on Lamictal. Been on 50mg since Aug 2016.

I've been through 5-6 different medications and many combinations to help better my situation and haven't had much success. I am 3/4 of the way through a gradual increase in dosage of Lamotrigine, and I'm taking 75mg currently. I hate to use the word ""miracle drug,"" but what this drug has done for me in the 5 weeks I have been on it is outstanding. After the first 25mg dose expired I began taking 50mg and it was almost like a switch was turned on in my head. I am up at a good time and became productive, which is a good change from sitting in bed for 16 hours replaying terrible scenarios over and over in my head. I've began dieting and exercising and my thoughts of impending doom and mood disorder symptoms have been much less than normal. I'm finally living life, and my relationships are getting better with less severe mood swings. I'm genuinely looking forward to increasing my dose when I see my psychiatrist next.",10

I have tried Celexa, Effexor, Abilify & Cipralex. All of them helped to some extent but not to completely stop the depression in the long term. My psychiatrist recommended Lamotrigine. I had seen on this site so many positive reviews that I decided to try it. Like many others, it has been a miracle drug for me. I have been on it for 3 months now and aside for 2 or 3 small bumps on the road, I feel great! Except for dry mouth (not that bad), I have had no side effects. Don't give up! Good luck :-)",10

Psychiatrist then recommended adding Lamotrigine to those two as a last stop before Lithium. No side effects noted  and raging hunger has gone. Almost from Day 1 I started feeling a bit better. Now 3 months down the line taking 50 mg a day I feel like my old self. Anxiety is virtually gone and I enjoy my life after months of misery. It has worked for me, I hope it works for you.",10
Mom off the roller coaster,"February 17, 2014",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This is the first medicine that has helped my 14 year old daughter. She has tried Prozac, zoloft, vyvanse, pristiq and some help from Wellbutrin. She has not been accurately diagnosed. Many different professionals have suggested dysthymia, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, MDD and bipolar II. She has been hospitalized 3 times. The last time she got out of the hospital, I asked if we could try a mood stabilizer. Lamictal was the doctors first choice. We slowly titrated up to 200 (it took 3 months), but it was well worth the wait. No side affects. No more roller coaster rides. Most importantly, my daughter has an understanding of what can trigger her moods and has the clarity to learn more about herself.",10

,,For Anxiety:,I have had excellent results with this medication. I have paralyzing anxiety related to PTSD. I have not had any side effects.

A year ago I was in such a deep depression (for months). I was not exactly suicidal but often prayed I would go to sleep & not wake up. I began seeing a new psychiatrist & he immediately started me on Lamictal. Literally within weeks I noticed my depression was now under control! I truly believe this medication saved my life.

,,For Depression:,"I have had anxiety since I was 18. Paxil worked wonders for me until after I had kids. From then on no SSRI's worked much any more. I found an amazing lady who helped me figure out what was going on. We agreed that I have mood disorder not otherwise specified. I don't fit the criteria for bipolar because I don't get manic and my depression showed up more as anxiety. Any how, I started taxing lamotrigine XR and it has changed my life! I get nervous I am going to jinx it by admitting out loud how much it has helped me:) I used to read these posts and pray I had the same positive experiences.

Effexor, Remeron, Trazodone or Wellbutrin simply do not work.   I can't tolerate a therapeutic dose of any Tricyclic. I started 25 mg of Lamotrigine and noticed a difference immediately--no crying jags, no passive suicidal ideation, no GI upset, no side effects at all except very vivid dreams.  My dose has now is up to 50 mg with a goal of increasing up to 200 mg daily if needed. Honestly, this has been a game change even though I was very hesitant to begin a new med that I associated with bipolar disorder .  I am so glad that I agreed to give it a try. No more SSRI's for me EVER! The only reason I don't rate it a 10 is because I frankly expect an even better therapeutic effect as my dose goes up.",9

I can feel the change completely, I just feel like everything is a little 'slower' and that I'm not racing all the time. Bipolar 2. Best medication I have been on by far and can honestly say that this is one I plan to stick to.

I feel compelled to write this review because, for me, it's been nothing short of a miracle. I have never felt this happy. I feel so alive and awake, like the cloud of irritation and grey has completely dissipated, and I don't mean that in a (hypo)manic way.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Lamictal for about nine months now. It is literally the THE BEST BIPOLAR MEDICATION I have come across. Right before going on Lamictal I was on the Abilify injection and although it kept me stable, it gave me a horrible side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia which for me showed up as uncontrollable mouth movements. My doctor recommended Lamictal after telling him my concern with the Tardive Dyskinesia. He first kept me on the Abilify and started on low dosages of Lamictal so that I can slowly ease into the new drug. If I remember correctly, he started me on 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 100mg then finally 200mg which is what I am on now. I believe I have been on 200mg since about February of 2019. I don’t  feel any weight gain, which I was very afraid of, although I don’t think it is one of the side effects of the drug. Please please consider this drug for stabilizing your mood for bipolar, you won’t regret it! :)",10

I experienced some uncontrollable tremors and shaking over my whole body for hours. I felt very sick, and nauseous. Recently I’ve noticed I had strong impulsive thoughts, which triggered panic attacks and just left me unable to function.
   At this point I feel like I’m not able to function in my daily life. I have had to take clonazepam multiple times daily since I’ve been on this medication when I had gone over two months without taking any.",1

My doctor tried several antidepressants (Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Paxil, Vybrid), and I had no benefits; only side effects. We also tried all kinds of benzodiazepines and they did nothing for me. Ambien would grant me only 3 hours of sleep. My symptoms would go from clammy hands and feet, heart racing and high blood pressure to sheer terror. My first day (really) on Lamotrigine and I already felt the symptoms subside. On the following days I felt even better. In two weeks I was feeling like myself again, so much that I was able to jump on a plane and travel to Brazil by myself. If nothing is working for you, give Lamotrigine a try.

Lamictal is a prescription that I intend to up my dose to 50mg though, and will do so gladly. People have commented on a more calm & ""mellow"" mood, a greater tolerance to stress and irritations, and being more pleasant to others. I'm on a slightly more even keel now & look forward to seeing what's next with increased dose",8

My brain feels clear. Able to hear, process, be patient, talk. Images and delusions have significantly dropped. I have been previously diagnosed with a disturbing purging disorder, body dysmorphia, ADHD, and panic disorder. These conditions were untreated two years ago.

I have some mood swings and have had some impulsive behavior that I am not proud of. I was always very ashamed of this and was lucky that I could contain it by really white-knuckling through life.

After a month or two all of the horrible side effects were gone. This medicine was a miracle for me, saved me, and my marriage.

After talking to my psych and stopping lamictal and taking biotin supplements, I could finally pass stool easily and slowly my hair grew back... though I sort of missed my leg and underarm hair not growing.

The only problems I've had were that it took a really long time for it to start working for me; I still found myself experiencing depressive episodes six months after beginning taking it.

I can say without a doubt that this drug has changed my life. I used to be angry at everyone, constantly agitated, hypo-manic and productive or hypomanic and destructive, or, most of the time, severely depressed and full of self-doubt. My life is entirely different, I go through most days feeling absolutely fine in my mind and body. When I don't feel great, I am able to check in on myself and take note of my symptoms, which then dissipate as soon as I comprehend them. My therapist says my pre-frontal lobes have come back and I have my higher functioning back again—it's been years since I felt this in touch with my thoughts and desires.

The more I read about it the more I realized I had been given the wrong diagnosis and the wrong treatments for years.

Lamotrigine seemed mild compared to the others and now I have been taking 200mg for the past fifteen years.

After confirming I have a gene that causes the latter, I spoke with my amazing prescriber about giving this a go. Since then, my world has changed for the better.

I'm at a higher dose so I often feel a little lethargic but I'll take that side-effect over SSRI's many terrible ones any day.

Coupled with therapy it's like a second chance at life!!!!",9
,,For Depression:,I've been on lamictal for over ten years. I changed psychiatrist due to moving. I told him that it helps with depression and bipolar. Now he wants me to go off of it. I tried to and became suicidal each time. I will not go off of it! It is a wonder drug! I highly recommend it.,10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This drug has given me my life back. I am now emotionally balanced, it has given me back the sparkle in my eye (says my wife), I can focus and I am dealing with things I was afraid to before due to BP anxiety. I was a complete MESS before lamictal, hardly able to take care of myself and had lost interest in all activities and v emotional depressed/antzy/angry despite being on lithium 1000, seroquel 100mg mirtazapine 25mg. On lamictal my brain just calmed the heck down. I feel normal, reasonable and have the energy and ability to DO things again. No side effects noticed on lamictal. Hope to stay on this drug for years to come. On a side note some BP groups on FB are really helpful and supportive and friendly. You are not alone with BP.",10
,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have suffered for more than 20 yrs with one diagnosis or another mainly bi polar and depression. I've had racing thoughts for many years and in the past few years I had difficulty remembering things. I told the doctor it was during times of stress. I have a very stressful job. I have past traumas and ask if he thought I had PTSD. He disregard what I said and said I have a lot of anxiety and put me on anti anxiety meds. I have been on every med for past twenty five years and suffered through it all. I was taking lithium, seroquel and an anti depressant for past ten years until the doctor finally suggest lamictal. I have taken 25mg for about 2 weeks and feel great no more racing thoughts, I can make decision, don't feel confused and can remember things. My thinking is so much more clear I feel sad I suffered so long. This medicine needs to be labeled for PTSD. Best wishes everyone.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I tried Lamictal several years ago for mood swings without having received a proper diagnosis, and experienced extreme rage. I was also in an unhealthy relationship at the time and was taking about 100mg lamictal. Since seeing a psychiatrist, I have been officially diagnosed as Bipolar Type 2, and have come to realize that I am extremely sensitive to medications (and everything else on the planet). I have been taking 25mg (pediatric dose) of Lamictal for about a month now with extreme improvement in moods. Similar to another review - you don't really notice how wonderful Lamictal works until you are put in a situation that would cause you to be anxious or react negatively. It has improved my overall view of myself, I haven't cycled, and I'm dealing with stressful situations in a much healthier way. I also have not had any side effects from this medication so far! Highly recommend.",10
,,For Anxiety:,"The only thing I've tried that's helped my anxiety and not had debilitating side effects. You have to slowly ramp up the dose to avoid the potential rash. 25mg, then 50mg, then 100mg, etc. It's also a bit stimulating for a few days whenever you increase the dose and this can manifest in anxiety if you're not moving around. But I can say that this drug is great - it helps all of my co-morbid symptoms to some degree - anxiety, bipolar, mood, etc. I'm now on 300mg extended release and feeling a lot better than I did before I started this. It brought my anxiety from an 8 down to a 5, I'd say, which still isn't great but I'm actually functional now. Been taking about four months.",10

After about three months of ever increasing dosage, I finally began to ""come out of my spider hole."" I quit drinking. I felt like Alice in Wonderland with her head breaking through the clouds. I also felt like my brain was slowly being rewired, smoothing over rutted neural pathways and creating new, calmer ones. it has been seven years now and I am up to 300 mg a day. Most importantly, I can FORGET the past abuse and feel happier than I have ever felt before.",10

I was put on a few different medications in the beginning, including Wellbutrin and Risperidone. Those eventually made things worse so I opted out of that treatment, and was prescribed Lamictal.

It took about a month to fully kick in, but I have noticed a huge difference in my mental state. I have not had a major depressive episode since starting treatment. I have not gone manic yet. For the first time in many years, I feel normal; I get happy when good things happen and sad when bad things happen. My feelings are not influenced by my illness anymore (at least not yet). Thanks, Lamictal!",10

Used to self-medicate with cannabis regularly but the strength of it induced psychosis, so have been 6 months without it. The  first five months off it were dreadful; hopelessness, poor diet, no exercise, spending all time in bed, not interacting with the world and a downward spiral of self-pity. My Doctor prescribed Lamictal and I was doubtful of its effectiveness. However, I noticed a stabilization in mood after just 3 days of taking 25 mg per day. And after a week, the improvements have increased so that I no longer feel hopelessness with no future. In fact, I feel normal, very normal. My diet has improved and my self-care - washing, cleanliness, etc - has returned. The drug really works and has greatly improved my self confidence and made everything so much easier. I would recommend it anyone suffering depression as it really does work.",9

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This was the first time I took a mood stabilizer. I have a rare case of my bipolar disorder coming on at around 1 so I knew nothing different for 35yrs. Now it's known bipolars need mood stabilizers then it was random antidepressants. My negative about the drug is it does effect your short term memory & can ""dumb you down"". My decision was to be dumb & sane instead of smart & out of control. I took the highest dose. After 4 yrs & the birth of a child the medication became much less effective so I've had to change. I had forgotten how horrible I felt off meds until I had to change. Lemictal saved me, it helped me become a better person & live in less pain. As with every medication for bipolar disorder you have to weigh pros & cons. I would not recommend this medication for anyone working in an intellectual based job where memory & use of math as such is involved. It can drastically lower your abilities. For me at the time it was more then worth it",7

I had to immediately discontinue use of Lamotrigine. I understand these are rare side effects that more than likely won't happen to most people, however it was unbearable for me.

I can't believe this is how neurotypical people feel day to day. I've been missing out my whole life and wish I took it sooner! I'm productive, I sleep normally, and I experience little to no anxiety or intense moods. Only downfall is I have had some vivid dreams and nightmares but they're definitely not as bad as my mood swings. Not even 100 percent sure they're from the Lamictal. Only reason why I gave it a 9/10 is because I haven't been on it for too long yet (25 MG twice daily)",9

After many many years of trying to get clean I reluctantly gave Lamictal a try. It has literally saved my life. It has totally balanced my crazy brain.

Lamictal changed all of that and turned my life around. I have now been on lamictal for 4 years. I have experienced no negative side effects. I am now in college with a 3.5 GPA. My mood is now more controllable, but it doesn't drug me to the point where I am a zombie or a different person.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal is life changer for bipolar 2, stopped throwing myself at alcohol to control tensions and hyper-reactivity, am less hyper sensitive and self-protectively aloof. Lost 20 lbs gained on Depakote. Cons: losing some mental sharpness. A little less smart, not inadequately but less quick and on-target. But easier to live with and happier. Well worth it! Sometimes need adjunct treatment for depression. (I recommend light therapy.) Doesn’t help intrusive thoughts, rehashing invasive memories; now trying clomipramine alongside. HAS been good for depression and especially hypomania, allows for ups, but curbs impulsive out-there behavior and hyper sensitivity. 
For me, the generic does NOT work as well. 
On 200 mg; tried 300mg and 400mg without added benefit and with disadvantages: you can feel missing a dose badly; after 6 hours of missing dose on 300mg I got lightheaded and found it difficult to drive. Some twitching and clumsiness on higher dose, but manageable. Go with the lowest dose that works.",9

Everyone has their ups and downs, that’s life - but chronic depression is nothing but days of downs - so hard to live with - for the first time in 30 years I feel ‘normal’. Trintellex has an added benefit of reducing brain fog, and my thinking is clearer.

I can honestly say after being on this ""wonder drug"" for 6 weeks I have stopped ignoring my calls and even managed a short walk with a friend recently instead of shutting myself away.

However, I began experiencing significant short-term memory impairment and realized that my mood stabilization also felt like mood flattening. I stopped being a self-starter and just felt no interest in setting any goals. My cognitive issues and lack of drive led to my losing my job.

I was surprised because Lamictal is usually given to bipolar people and I'm absolutely not bipolar, but it has really helped me.  The only side effect I noticed is a tendency to break out a little more (not THE RASH).  No weight gain (weight gain is an issue with so many other depression meds) and no other problems.",10
,,For Depression:,"Lamotirgine  was really a game changer for me and my depression.  I use this in combination with an SSRI antidepressant, another mood stabilizer and old school antidepressant.  I have treatment resistant depression and borderline personality disorder.  Lamotrigine has really helped keep the lows from being so significantly low and helped keep the impulsivity to a minimum.   My dose ranges from 25-200mg over the years and depending on symptoms.  But I have no side effects or complaints.  Just thankful",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"Been on Lamictal for about 5 yrs after many yrs of antidepressants and anxiety medicines. About 6 yrs ago after a very traumatic experience with losing my boys and husband nothing worked anymore, I started having stress induced seizures, some very serious! They put me on Lamictal and my periods of mania and mind racing slowly stopped, my restless legs syndrome went away. I actually started to feel and not be a robot. Side effects for me are drowsiness and slight weight gain (8 lbs), I'd gain any amount to feel normal. One VERY important fact to remember is dosage! Everyone has different amounts that work, and don't ever skip or adjust dosage on your own! I did it and paid the price. Hope this helps! I feel grateful to my doc for prescribing.",9
,,For Depression:,"Note - I take Lamictal for treatment resistant depression, but that wasn't offered as one of the condition choices.

Lamictal has been a godsend. My p-doc prescribed it to augment the Effexor (300 mg/day) that I take. As others have noted, you have to titrate up gradually on Lamictal so it can take about six weeks (in my case) to start seeing improvement. At 75mg/day I definitely began to notice a change for the better and at 100mg/day (which I've been taking now for 2.5 weeks) the positive impact has been dramatic. 

I don't wake up every morning plagued by anxiety and negative, self-loathing rumination. I am actually happy which hasn't been the case for many years.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"As the reviews below say, I feel as if this medicine has changed my life. I suffer from CPTSD, Bipolar, Depression and Anxiety after being placed in a foster home at 7 years old and being separated from my birth parents. I still feel a little anger at times but NOTHING like before, I use to think the whole count to three thing was garbage but this medication allows me to do that and make RATIONAL decisions. I recommend this medicine for anyone who believes they're bipolar or depressed. The only CON reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I am constantly hungry where I am always thinking about my next meal which is very different but this just might be a personal thing. Good luck and good health!",9
Tex,"September 6, 2019",For Anxiety:,"I am on my third month of the med using for anxiety. I was on 25mg and just went to 50mg this past week. It has helped with my anxiety. I am now able to go out places and not freak out. I rather stayed home before but I can do more now without the anxiety. I also use Lutuda for bipolar and Ambien  at night. Since starting this, it has truly helped me all around. I have lost some weight and had a bad acne break out, dizziness and memory loss but I’m going to continue it to see what happens. Thanks",10
soulshine95,"March 8, 2014",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I have since I was very young displayed what I know now as Type I Bipolor disorder. Probably one of the worst feeling in the world is to have emotions ebb in and out like tall crashing waves. Then the sun comes out and the water is calm. Then a couple days later here comes the storm. It is the worst feeling to think there is nothing that will help. I felt that way.....time after time different meds. Abilify to be one exact example led me to have Hypothyroidism. A condition I have to have meds for the rest of my life. I have after trying many different meds for depression to find only one medicine I would suggest and that is Lamictal. If you are compatible with this medication it will help the mood swings a great deal.,10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"so Lamictal takes a while to work...in my case it was about 6 months to reach is maximum effect.I am on 200 mg. if I go higher it is a total nightmare. be careful it depends on the person how much you can take. if you feel you are going more depressed go to the dose you were before and take clonazepan as needed but not everyday. lamictal affected my sleep I had to take ambien but after 6 months I started taking melatonin and it worked. I wanted to say that it is important is family support and when that is non existent then in my case, i grabbed a Bible and prayed a lot even until today. psalm 91 and Ephesians 6:10, also Psalm 23. it gets in a point when you have to fight your brain. doctors and medication helps until certain point.",8

Sore throat, dry red eyes, dry mouth, muscle pain, muscle spasms, disorientation, neck pain, back pain, lost 12kg, no sex drive, burning sensation on the skin, tiredness, insomnia, vivid dreams, hard to breathe, chest pain, flu like symptoms, confusion, memory loss, constant nausea, vomiting, fatigue, constant headache. Really bad bad drug, I will never take any other drug again.",2
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,This med  Lamictal is fantastic for bipolar.  I have tried several SSRI  drugs and venlafaxine.  They would work for a while then quit.  Also tried seroquel and zyprexa.  I still have seraquel 50 mg twice a day with lamotrigine 150 twice a day.  That helps the best I have ever had.  I recommend this medicine.,10

My mood has never been this stable from as far as I can remember. It took a few months to work though, and dosage is really critical. Going from 100mg to 200mg made a BIG difference. I also started taking more at night which helps keeps my irritability down in the morning.

I haven't had any side effects at all from this, except decrease in appetite. Being already skinny, this is a little disappointing, however I'd take that any day over depression.",8
Juniper Berry,"November 25, 2015",For Depression:,"I originally began Lamotrigine about 6 weeks ago for Visual Snow syndrome caused by hallucinogen use. I am only on 75mg at this point as I've had to titrate up slowly. I've suffered major depression for most of my life and mild anxiety in the past year. I have noticed a HUGE difference in my mood on Lamotrigine. I have a greater sense of well being, I no longer think about suicide and I feel great about myself. It also decreases the intensity of my visual snow symptoms. I hardly notice or care about it anymore. No side effects either. This drug has truly been a blessing.",10
,,For Depression:,"I was prescribed lamictal for treatment-resistant depression. I had tried every SSRI under the sun starting at age 14 with little to no relief. After slowly titrating to a dose of 150mg, life has been so much easier. No extremely low moods and a definite increase in motivation. An added bonus is that it seems to help with my social anxiety as well. Overall, without this drug I might not have made it. Truly magic for me. And to those who are correctly diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression....mention lamictal to your psych!",10
,,For Anxiety:,"I love lamictal. I have anxiety, depression and epilepsy. I can’t take SSRI’s because they are too activating for me. Lamictal helps so much with my anxiety depression and racy thoughts. Lamictal is not that activating however it keeps me up at night so I started taking it in the morning. I take it along with a lose dose of Topamax and they both help with my mood too.",10

I tried so hard my whole life to control my emotions and thoughts. Eventually self medicated with drugs. 
Finally decided to get sober and doctor said it be much easier if I stabilized my emotions so he recommended lamictal - because I refused to take any medications that make me gain weight. 

Lamictal changed my life. Don't get me wrong- I still get annoyed - but I can stop, think, and react calmly in a way that I just couldn't do before. I also don't cry over every little thing any more. Lamictal saved my life!",10

That is the level that gave me my life back. Have stayed on that level and it is still working after 6 months. Hang in there. Once you find the drug to regain balance, things will get better. For me, that drug was Lamotrigene.",10

Unfortunately I haven't noticed any improvement. I was recently diagnosed with rapid cycling BP II although I have never experienced hypomania. My mood swings from normal to deep anxiety/depression within each day. Wake up every morning with paralyzing anxiety/depression. My mood improves in the afternoon and in the evenings I usually feel fine - only to wake up feeling miserable the next day. This has been my pattern now for 18 months and I am beyond exhausted. I am meeting my psychiatrist this week to discuss my diagnosis and switching meds.,1
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I am autistic, not bipolar, but was prescribed Lamictal  (400mg) really worked for my major meltdowns. It has decreased my issues by 80-90%. My family can definitely tell when I forget to take it because I turn into a hot emotional mess! I wish I would have had this as a kid because it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety. The ONLY drawback is that the pill tastes absolutely horrible. If I get a taste of it on my tongue, it makes me want to vomit. Sometimes it just won’t go down with my other pills so I’m left struggling to swallow it.",9
RachaelAB,"April 12, 2016",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Seizure Prevention:,"I went through study after study as a kid without diagnosis. I found out 6 months after I had my 1st child at age 22 I had epilepsy. The pregnancy increased my symptoms and seizure to 3-5 times a day. The first med they put me on was lamictal and I stayed on this med for 8 yrs without any distracting symptoms. After I divorced I tried to go off them due to no insurance, I soon realized how well they did work. I ended up going back on them within two months because my seizure ended up coming back as soon as the med eased out of my system. It has now been a combined 12 yrs on this med and I don't intend on changing anytime soon.

,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"Much less anxiety and agitation. Much less impulsivity. Much more stable relationships, feels like I've got thicker skin now! Blunts depression but does not take it away completely, need to add antidepressants to take it away completely. Does not remove obsessive/intrusive thoughts but helps me manage them much better. Had some side effects first few months, like having trouble with how to spell (Weird right?) and forgetting words but those abated. Now at 200mg I sometimes have problems focusing my eyes but it is totally worth it, I can work and function! 10/10!",10
,,For Depression:,"Research side effects of this lamotrigine drug! Especially Stevens Johnsons Syndrome. This is NOT just a rash as your doctor would say, should be labeled as a burn. Signs of the syndrome are swelling of eyes and lips. Then your whole body starts blistering. Skin peeling.

I feel the best I’ve felt in a long time with bipolar! I have lost weight.. around 10 pounds which has never been easy for me to do but I’m thinking it’s only because I’m more stable & level headed. I also deal with PTSD from childhood abuse & early adult years. I take prozasin at night for it to curb nightmares. I did notice I began dreaming more often when I started taking the Lamictal & nightmares... taking prozasin at night has done wonders.,10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"On it for 6 years 200mg twice a day. This was a life-changing drug for me I also take Ritalin which has been working for the last 2 years. The lamictal really makes me feel like I have a repaired foundation in my personality. The Ritalin has added to my concentration and keeps me calm and even keeled.  I had tried many other medications from my psychiatrist that worked for a short time,   but nothing has been as long lasting as these 2 medications.  One of the best reasons I have for knowing that they are doing their job is.. most people who know me such as friends ,  family and fiance would like to give my doctor a great big kiss..",10

It is saving me in so many ways. No more extreme lows, impulsiveness, I think before I act, anger has subsided, anxiety is slowly creeping away, no suicidal thoughts, no crying at nothing, not up and down like a yoyo throughout the day. I have been on every medication for BPD and my panic disorder/ anxiety. This is the only one that has worked with no weight gain. Initial sleepiness, slight nausea and diarrhea as side effects. But it subsides If you push through. Thank goodness for this mood stabilising medication.",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Lamotrigine for over 5 years. It changed my life. My mood swings were mostly internalized from what I could tell. I miss the manic episodes but I don’t miss quitting my dream job for no apparent reason, other than something trivial setting me off. That went on for years. Bad impulsive decisions, regretting once my mood swung back the other way, repeat. No side effects for me. I take 300mg a night. I wish I would have known about this medication 30 years ago. I can only imagine where I’d be today. I think it took a few weeks to start to notice the change. I will never stop taking it. I’m very happy to see that it has helped others. I’m pretty much normal now. Even keel. I still struggle with intrusive thoughts, but it’s minimal.",10

I feel I can talk to anyone now, have lots more confidence, and feel way more motivated. One thing too is that since I am motivated and keep myself, busy I don't overeat like I did when I was going through my major ups and downs.  Like others have stated, talk therapy in conjunction with these meds helps tremendously.  What also helps is having a good support group too :)",10

I thought I was better once and stopped taking it and oh boy my family was like get back on your meds! I will never stop taking this medication again!

My doc said the ""therapeutic"" dose so am slowly titrating up to 200 mg - currently at 175/day.  Just yesterday I think I started feeling the miracle of Lamictal kicking in!

This stuff isn’t working for me, needless to say I am to call my psych doctor ASAP. 
Lashing out at my husband over stupid stuff isn’t fun.... I feel like rubbish and I feel like everything’s my fault. I seriously don’t wanna be here, and I really don’t wanna end up in the psych ward before I can see the doctor because I can’t ever get the right medicine...",1

My doctor prescribed me Lamicatal at 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for another 2 weeks, with maintenance at 100mg after that. I was tearful because I was terrified to relive what had happened before. Much to my surprise, Lamictal is what I consider my 'life saver'. I feel my moods have been maintained and balanced since beginning this medication.

This with my 150mg bupropion and 60mg of duloxtine has changed my life. I've only felt suicidal once over these 7 months and it was manageable and it abated quickly. My moods are stable and I've been able to face some challenges that would have crushed me if I wasn't taking lamotrigine. I love being stable and level headed.

,,For Anxiety:,"I have been taking 100mg lamotrigine twice daily for several months now and feel really good on it.

I felt like I was getting too anxious and dropped back to 25mg 2xd. After my anxiety was under control, I began to titrate back up and things went really well. I actually think I was getting more anxious before because I was so used to feeling anxious, and not feeling anxious was so foreign to me.  Anyway, I'm glad I tried it and I'm glad I'm on it!",9

However, the DAY of taking Lamotrigine my emotions just calmed down. My life has improved exponentially. I feel like I can have a family, a career, a stable relationship, and haven't been ""on the edge"". I know studies say it doesn't work for us. I disagree because this is my miracle drug. Other meds didn't work for me, so my psych recommended lamotrigine. If you feel like you're watching a monster take over your life and you're just there for the ride: I recommend this. If you feel like your emotions take control of your body: I recommend this.
Negatives: Numb for the first week. Felt like I didn't love anyone? That's gone now.
Oil production: Worst acne of my life. That's ok.

The worst thing of having bipolar 2 was dealing with my horrible anger problems and having people scared of me. I used to hold on to the fact that my son was the only reason I was alive but lamotrigine has given me a new lease on life. Lamotrigine makes me feel like I should have felt since I was younger!",10

I have actually had a good weight loss since my last increase to 300mg. Don’t know if the two are related but I had been very overweight. I would recommend working with your doctor to get to the correct dosage and the correct side meds, I take it with Latuda, since it was not as effective for me at lower doses.

Back then doctors were scared to death of Lamictal because of the rash that few to none got when properly prescribed. I couldn't find one to prescribe so I got it from my family doctor. That was the best day of my life. I titrated the lithium while slowly adding the Lamictal with no problems. I have been taking 450mg a day ever since.

I love this medication so much because life is 1000x more manageable and I never knew I could feel this way. I was so close to ending my life and this medication saved me along with learning DBT skills. However, it was really uncomfortable until I got stabilized on the 150mg.

I had hit a new low, then started effexor and I knew in  two weeks, but it was almost immediate for me I started to feel better.

However, the intensity and frequency of these episodes have diminished greatly. Lamictal has really improved my life and I think I would be in a drastically worse position without taking it.

It was definitely effective for me to do it this way.,9

In combination with Prozac, I have started my titration of Lamictal. I tried Zyprexa and gained 20 pounds in a month. With Lamictal, I've lost that and more. I hardly feel hungry. I have faith that once my dose is increased I won't have as many depressed days. So far so good!",9
Patrick1969,"June 6, 2017",For Depression:,"I never write reviews but this time I had too.  I am 24 years old and had depression since I was in fifth grade. It was manageable up until I graduated high school. When I started working in taking on more responsibilities I started getting depression really bad . To the point I cannot handle anything anymore. I tried Venlafaxine for 5 years.  It worked good on the mood and the depression but as it went on the side effects kept getting worse and worse which made me stop taking it. Terrible withdrawal. I then took mirtazapine for 6 months didn't work. Now taking lamotrigine at 100 mg - (after upping slow) Took about two months, I have never felt this good in a long time! No more worrying no more depression! I highly recommend this!!!",10
Ansioso,"March 3, 2017",For Anxiety:,"I suffered for 39 years of chronic anxiety. I've taken many meds (SSRIs, benzos) CBT, meditation, etc.  They helped to certain extend but the crippling anxiety was always there, waiting for me every morning. Anxiety affected everything in my life, the job I did, the women I dated, the manner I interacted with others and many other aspects of my life. Then I tried Lamotrigine and once I reached 100 mg I felt normal for first time in my life. This is a miracle drug. I'm currently taking 300 mg.I had a had a rash when I was in 100 mg. Many people overreact and stop taking it thinking there skin is going to fell off. I just went back to 75 mg for few more weeks and slowly increased the dose without any issues. 99.9 of the rash is innocuous",10

For as long as I can remember, I've constantly had running thoughts and was always thinking of multiple things at a time. I can now think straight thoughts, I'm able to think a good amount clearer and because of it my stress has been a lot lower.

In the first couple weeks of starting Lamictal, I was able to quit smoking weed and cigarettes!! I didn't have insomnia as I previously did when trying to quit marijuana. My mood was much improve. I had been suicidal before and I started exercising again on Lamictal. I developed an unknown rash about 2 years into Lamictal and stopped immediately. The rash disappeared. It looked like 8 mosquito bites all over my legs. I was forced to try Abilify which made me gain over 40 pounds and take naps during the day.

,,For Depression:,"I’ve been on Lamictal for 5 years at 200 mg, I still have severe depression & cry almost everyday, I have a lot going on in my life so maybe that’s why nothing is working, I am also on 10 mg of Lexapro, still depressed, hard to get out of bed & going in the morning. I look forward to sleep so I don’t have to think about anything. I feel like all the meds I’ve tried either don’t work or make me gain a ton of weight if I knew Lamictal had these awful side effects including depression I would have never started it, going to try & wean off of it slowly",1
,,For Depression:,"I have been on various anti depressants since my late teens. Everything's from fluoxetine citalopram, clomipramine and in a full breakdown; a combination of mirtazapine and Effexor. It was this last one which took me sky high and so I stopped, also due to 30kg weight gain. After a couple of months I was suicidal and because I was diagnosed with bipolar since the mania on the antidepressants I was recommended going on to a cocktail of quetiapine, depakote and lithium. No way was I taking that with the side effects and the horror stories about weight gain as I've lost the 30kg in weight I put on. Lamotrigine I heard was the only one for helping without the weight gain so I gave it a go. It took about 2 months but it works a treat now on 300mg",8
,,For Depression:,"I was put on Lamitrigine after Citalopram stopped working, and Escitalopram made me suicidal. I expressed that I'd wanted to avoid certain symptoms of SSRI's again and med nurse prescribed this. I've been on it for about two months -- titrating up from 25mg/2weeks, 50mg/2 weeks, and 100mg now. I haven't noticed any improvement in my depression, nor anxiety, or other symptoms therein in addition to the ones caused by and exacerbated by my ADHD. If anything I think I might be a little more unhinged (overly sensitive, mood drops happening with more frequency, lots more bouts of crying) but that could easily be because of something else. So, I haven't noticed any bad side effects (lymph nodes got a little swollen? which was something I was told to look out for, but it's Sick Season) but it hasn't helped in the slightest, either. I don't have any energy or motivation, which is kind of needed to make any progress in therapy, so.. definitely switching meds the first chance I get.",3
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine):,I started this drug on 25mg 2x a day then increased to 50mg 2x a day after the first week. After about 4 days I woke up with a SEVERE rash covering my entire body from head to toe. I was rushed to the ER and they told me it could be SJS but they didn't know and all they could do is monitor me. I went to a dermo who took a biopsy and the condition was an adverse reaction to the Lamictal called erythema multiforme. I am still covered in rashes and it's the second day. I am on Prednisone 60 mg for 3 days and will taper off. This drug should be illegal I have never been more uncomfortable and in pain my entire life I couldn't even look at myself it was so scary.

I think my dosage may be too high but my neurologist refuses to lower it because of its outcome thus far. I have tried to learn to deal with the side effects. I do not think that they will ever go away but I guess I can just be happy being seizure free. I was on Trileptal before and was having seizures every time I was stressed about something.

But it really is. The only downside is that since you have to slowly increase your dose to avoid the terrible rash, it might take a while for you to get to a level where it's helping as much as it can. But once you get up to the dose that's right for you, it's awesome and I haven't noticed any bad side effects.",9

I was definitely cognitively sharper. By evening I would feel a bit of a crash/ low. 
But then it started to cause nightmares for me, waking multiple times at night in panic and sweating (I have prior trauma). So too sum things up, tremor, mania and nightmares were not doing my anxiety and depression any good. I slowly reduced and stopped this med as it wasn’t right for me.",2

I never realized it could have been a chemical imbalance until I ""flipped"" from giving up on life, to ""everything is great!  What was I thinking!"" Then back to giving up again within 3 hours.

I LOVE THIS STUFF. Its helped me so much, I've gone off lithium and am taking it exclusively for BP2. I'm on a low dose of 50 mg because I experienced some itching at first, which did go away after about a month. Now, I have NO side effects, and my depression is GONE without me feeling numb.

Effects have been positive overall -- peaks and valleys are smoothed out, focus improved, no suicidal thoughts. Panic attacks emerged briefly after one year, which went away after doc added 20mg buspirone (short story, negative side effects/interactions of buspirone were also very bad).

My Dr. said that I was taking too much (200mg twice a day).  I took time off Lamictal, and my moods started to fluctuate after a while (not straight away), and my partner took me aside and told me that it was time to get back on it.

After being diagnosed bipolar 2, he suggested another med. I strongly advocated for Lamictal. I tapered up to 200mg, on a conservative schedule. I've had good results over the past 9 months. It definitely has lowered the instances of hypomania, or at least deescalated the intensity. It's done little to address the depression or anxiety, so we've agreed to add anti-depressant. Again, he suggested Cymbalta, which I opposed due to the all the information regarding withdrawal syndrome. We agreed on a low dose of Prozac which is going well so far.",8

I started with .25 mg and now I'm at 200 mg and am feeling way better.. the downside, if you want to call it that, is that I am starting to have feelings again.

They told me that I shouldn't feel a difference until at least 150mgs but I felt it at 75mgs. I'm currently on 400mgs which is usually the highest for treating bipolar. It is also used to treat epilepsy, and people with epilepsy take thousands of mgs a day, so it I felt safer when experimenting with it.

I'd say it's genuinely beneficial for bipolar depression. A little dizziness but not so bad, and it fades. My friends say there's no evidence that more than 100mg or 150 helps, but it could increase side effects. 100 is good",10

At first it seemed to work, depression was not that deep and derealization seemed to be gone like as I was a kid again. But eventually after three weeks I've noticed that it all got much worse depressive/ aggressive wise. I also started getting chills and shivering with headaches. 
Last thing I wanted to add - don't mix it with anything like weed or alcohol.

I was suffering from panic attacks and mental break-downs. I could not find pleasure in anything or even go to work I was completely non functional. Lexapro just escalated this feeling and made me suicidal, it is a ""fit all"" drug that just made me so much worse. It is now my third week on Lamotrigine and the panic has calmed. I still get anxiety but these thoughts are not all-consuming. Almost no days stuck in bed with dark thoughts. I am able to face daily challenges now without absolutely crumbling.  I am now on 50mg and considering going up only because the improvement has been great. In my opinion this drug is much more effective than SSRI'S, it simply cuts out the extra brain-activity and lets your mind rest enough to start enjoying life again :)) It does get better and give Lamotrigine a try!!",9
FireFerret,"August 7, 2020",For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"Lamotrigine sounded like a great drug at first, it doesn't affect your sexual health, it doesn't make you emotionally numb, and I imagine it helps a lot of people. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS SCARE YOU But unfortunately, for me, according to my doctor it had a very bad reaction once I moved up to 100mg that unfortunately landed me in hospital and rendered me unable to function properly for the next two weeks. It was due to my genetic profile and medication sensitivity that caused my body to reject the drug, If you are sensitive to higher doses to medication generally or get extreme anxiety with your borderline I highly recommend getting pharmacogenomic testing or a genetic profile for the medication (in Australia it is not that expensive) before taking this medication. What happened to me was rare but can happen, and I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through But in saying this please don't be scared to try this medication, because it has worked wonders for so many people.",2
,,For Depression:,"Lamotrigine has been a life saver. Though I do not have any manic disorders, I do struggle with anxiety and depression. I am currently on a high dose mixed with a high dose of zoloft and that combination has completely transformed my life and made me feel like myself again. It eased my mood swings, depressive episodes, and anxiety. Since being on it I have noticed a huge improvement and would recommend anyone struggling with depression/anxiety to bring it up with your doctor to see if it would be a good
choice for you. All in all a very effective medicine.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have rapid clycling bipolar disorder and was diagnosed five years ago.

After trying, Seroquel, Risperdal and Lithium with failure, a combination of Lamictal and Rivotril works for me.

All the other medicines never work or side effects where making me drowsy.  

I got side effects from Lamictal for 2 days when I increased the dose every two weeks until I got to the recommended dose and I take Rivoril to control anxiety every now and then.  

Also the anxiety diminished as the Lamictal dose got closer to the full recommended dosage.",10

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on and off this medication for nearly 10 years and it has been generally helpful most of the time. It takes a long time to titrate up, and the there is a very specific dose that is different for everybody, but once you get it right, the medication is remarkably helpful.

In my experience, it all but eradicates Bipolar Depression and it reduces the severity of Bipolar Mania. 

Don't worry so much about the rash if you're a hypochondriac like me. ""The Rash"" most likely would only be limited to mucus membranes around the eyes, nose, mouth and genitals.

One thing I should add: over time, the medications seems to lose effectiveness and if you frequently discontinue, this effect is exacerbated. Eventually I had to add lithium.",9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I'm bipolar II and this med works very well. The depression still comes and goes and I do feel kinda crappy somewhat often, but it is definitely not horrible and incapacitating like it was before. Also Lamictal has reduced my hypomania probably by half, and makes it barely noticeable unless I am trying to sleep. A huge plus is that I've had ZERO side effects of any kind (other than temporary ones when increasing doses), which is very rare for antidepressants and anti-mania drugs. Hope this was helpful and hopeful",8
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,Starting Lamictal with the smaller doses did not offer much alleviation until I was titrated up to about 75-100mg.

The only side effects I faced upon starting and a few days after titration include dizziness and mild insomnia.,9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Currently, I'm prescribed to 100mg of Lamictal, 200mg of Zoloft, 10mg of Adderall IR, and 20mg of Adderall XR. 

I originally started on Lamictal at 25mg, and it had little affect on my mood stability. I believe it triggered a mixed state episode until I was prescribed 100mg. About two months in, it's been a lifesaver. My moods feel very stable, I am generally happy, and I am able to take care of myself with little resistance. I am also motivated to regularly run errands. (I do believe it may have made me slighty manic.)

Prior to Lamictal, I was on 25mg of Abilify, and it was ineffective and made me very tired. I had poor hygiene, I was unable to interact with others or be in public places, and I had difficulty keeping up with housework",9

I don't have a warning such as a strange smell, taste, or  feeling that a lot of people with seizure disorders experience.

I sleep better, I have less obsessive thoughts, the irritability has decreased , and I'm happier in general. I've had no side effects that I'm aware of which is very rare for me as I have a tendency to react to medications negatively.

I was hospitalized for two weeks and put on 80 mg of prednisone to try to control it until my body wouldn't metabolize that amount and then I was put on methylprednisone. The rash took two months to go away only after bouts of severe itching, bumps, burning and sloughing of skin from everywhere on my body for weeks. I had to take colloidal oatmeal baths with oil several times a day just to remotely tolerate it.   Unfortunately I am one of the rare cases that has a severe life-threatening reaction to it called D.

I stopped the medication on the advice of my physician and am on good supplements and a multivitamin but it is a month later and the hair loss is continuing. It’s frightening as I was not on a very high dose but it seemed to have put my system into some sort of shock. No meds now and just l-theanine, taurine, and magnesium which have certainly helped the anxiety. My husband is on lamictal and never had the hair loss that I did. Never again.",1

The first time I ever took Lamotrigine I felt like a new person completely, even my friends noticed how I was all of a sudden level headed and not as restless etc. 
Unfortunately this feeling soon disappeared no matter how much I went up on the dosage :( 
But this is still a very good drug and helps my anger/rage very well. 
I've also noticed that when I miss a dosage, I drop into much more of a depression so it must help stabilise my mood more than I realise. 
Overall very good medication with NO side effects for me.

My perception of time is all out of whack too. I said I have been taking it for only 5 months but that is so hard to believe! It feels like I've on it for at least a year. Oh well.

I know it's early days to call it a win but I immediately felt better. The volume on that horrible self talk has been muted, I feel positive and optimistic.

I feel so much better. I actually smile and laugh. I feel more engaged, focused, have more desire to be active and around people and I have not had suicidal ideation or feelings since the med kicked in. It did take several weeks for the med to begin to start working. For me it has been over a month before noticeable changes took effect. I hope it continues to work this well.

I read someone said it was their miracle drug. That's for me also. The things I don't like about it is that (it doesn't happen so much any more) it makes me off balance. Kind of like I walk like a drunk person. Then the only other thing is that if I miss one dose it takes 2-3 days to get the brain/body shocks to stop. If you miss three days/doses I was told that you have to start taking the drug over again like you've never used it before. Don't miss getting your refills on time. I am definitely a ""person"" now as well. Without it life is extremely bad. I've been taking it for over 6 years.",9

I’ve tried around 15 to 20 other medications and have had no luck other than with gabapentin and that only helped for around a month before I’d need to increase dosage again. My rating is more based of how it’s the only thing to help over how much it has helped me I will review this medication again in the future under the same nickname in around 6 months as long as I’m still taking it (and remember to do so).

I managed to change psychiatrists, I told him that I was still sleeping 10 hours a day and mentally dull with Symbyax, so I get prescribed 100mg of lamotrigine and 50mg of quetiapine which does not make me fat at such a low dose, and since then I sleep only 8-7 hours and I can continue with my life without depression, mania or drowsiness.

You must be patient through it's inductive stage so stick with it for at least a month.,10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've had a few unpleasant side effects. I feel truly blessed with this medication. I had bipolar 2 and  other more common medications were not an option for my mood disorder. 
It keeps me so much more stable. I took a lot of drugs before and was suicidal. I was able to get off drugs and stopped my suicidal urges.
I had grown unfaithful with psychiatry.  I was sure that this medicine would not work like every other thing but it helped me so much. 
There are so many positive effects. Prevents suicidal urges, lessen depression, relaxes my body, helped me take lower doses of Xanax, helps anxiety, helps sleep, Happy sometimes
Cons - It effects my memory bad and I've lost a lot of hair. I'm a girl and my hair is really thinning out. :/",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,I was misdiagnosed for several years by numerous doctors who all kept throwing drugs upon drugs to deal with one symptom after another. I finally found my current psychiatrist who properly diagnosed me at that time with BP2. I started on Lamictal then and as the years have progressed and episodes have happened and my diagnosed changed to BP1 my dosage changed. I've been taking 600 mg for years and have had no side effects at all. To keep my mania at bay I take 600 mg of seroquel daily and then 300 mg of Wellbutrin to keep depression leveled out. I have to take 400 mg of Lamictal in the morning and then the other 200 mg at night before bed. That seems to keep a even range in my body.,10
,,For Depression:,"I feel Lamictal has made a big difference in my depression and mood swings. My twin sister takes it too for Borderline personality disorder for and she says it helps her impulsivity and mood swings as well. I also have an erratic mood and nice a difference on this drug. 

I'd say it mostly helps with depression though. I went from sleeping all the time and feeling numb to having some feeling again.",9

When I started taking Lamictal it seemed like my pain subsided and I was able to easily quit using my medication. Also haven't felt a need to drink alcohol. Feel very stable and seems like my interests are coming back. I've taken lamictal before for a couple years and don't remember why I got off. First time I took it I got a rash but it went away. This time have not experienced a rash. Taking 200mg morning 200mg night. Seems to be a perfect dose for me. So much easier with my business, wife, and kids. They didn't deserve my mood swings.",9

I noticed that after a couple weeks the Lamictal started to wear off a little and the depression started to appear again. I was started on 25 mg and then upped to 50 mg. A few days ago I noticed the depression again. I'm going to ask my Dr. to up my dose again. Sorry for the long response lol. I just wanted to let anyone else know that I'm going through a similar experience.",9

My only complaint is lately depression is creeping up on me, but this could be just part of the ""winter blues.""  On Lamictal, I am not emotionless; it just helps with the dramatic mood swings (I have Bipolar type 1).  I was given Lamictal as an option due to the fact that I requested a medicine that will not make me gain weight.  As I was told, I do notice Lamictal seems to be weight-neutral, which is a good thing.  I haven't been on Lamictal more than a few months yet, but I am hoping it continues doing its job.",8

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on lamotrigine for nearly a week now. For the last 4 years I've not been able to control my depression, causing my personal and professional relationships to suffer drastically. 3 hours after my first dose I was able to confidently leave the house with a smile on my face. My manic reactions ceased day 1 and I have a clarity in my mind I remember from childhood. 
It is too early for me to discuss any possible side effects other than less sleep, but going from 14 hours plus sleep a day to 6-8 most likely has a lot to do with it. Yesterday my car broke down on the side of the road on a hot Australian spring day and my anxiety was a complete non event. I wish I had this diagnosis and drug much sooner in my life. It has completely stopped any suicidal thoughts that used to plague me daily. I recommend anyone on the fence to break down your anxiety regarding seeing someone for help. This has changed my outlook on life in a way I never thought possible",10

,,For Anxiety:,"I was on Lexapro for years when I decided to step off. The process was slow and difficult, and I experienced brain zaps and other scary side effects. About a year later I had a severe mental breakdown and ended up in a crisis center. I was completely hopeless. Frightened. And experienced a primal fear. A fear you get when being chased by a wild animal. I saw a psych and she started me on Lamotrigine - and slowly went up over the course of three months to 200 mgs. I am four months into this medication and am so proud to say that I haven’t had a panic attack in a month. Not long ago I had them every single day. I experienced none of the side effects that SSRI’s gave me and I feel like I’m getting control of my life back. I’m so happy I gave medication another try. There is no shame in taking meds. You deserve to feel your best and love this one life we have to the fullest.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Following about 4 months of being in a depressed state for little to no apparent reason (things were going good in my life), I added Lamictal to what I was taking.  Along with Lithium, I took Lamictal for Bipolar.  Lamictal worked very effectively to remove depression in a week.  The issue was that I got out of depression so quickly, that I actually entered into a moderate manic episode.  The episode did not lead to hospitalization, but had many of the elements that manic episodes have involving spending and lack of sleep and grandious thoughts and behavior.  I didn't experience any negative side effects with the drug, and I just think for me the drug jolted me too much.  No rash or anything, just scared me since I entered the manic.",8
,,For Anxiety:,Lamictal made my anxiety worse. With each increase in dosage I became more agitated. I stopped at 100mg and stayed on it for one month; during that month I experienced more panic attacks than I'd ever had in such a short time. My dr weaned me off and my anxiety got better. We are now trying a different medication.,1

I take 200mg Lamictal ODT (orally dissolving tablet) morning and night.  Lamictal ODT is expensive and tastes awful but the ODT works better than the regular pill form of Lamictal for me.

I stuck it out for almost 1.5 months on Lamictal only 25 mg's, and trust me, I feel a world of a difference. My life has changed. I feel like I can focus. Although there is MILD emotional numbing, almost stoic, I am able to be present with people and calmly socialize. It is easier to process emotions, which used to be overwhelming before. It allowed my mindfulness and self acceptance practise to skyrocket.

Took Prozac for 10 years, which was so so for my depression. This one really makes a difference in my day to day. Only side effect, some vision impairment and some shoulder pain that comes and goes (but it could be caused by some personal issues that I am going through now) Anyhow, this medicine is one of the two that really showed me how is to not feel depressed (the other one is Lyrica, which sadly is the fastest way to weight gain).

BTW, one thing I know for sure is that any of the SSRI available (for example Lexapro), just block your emotions good and bad. For me, a price that I discovered pretty high to pay.

Sara,"July 29, 2019",For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"Lamotrigine immediately took away my hypervigilance and ruminations at the smallest dose of 25mg. Unfortunately many psychiatrists are not willing to maintain such a small dose as it is technically a pediatric dose; not therapeutic for adults. As my dose was titrated up, the side effects began. At 50mg my vision became blurry, my passion for life stunted, with a constant runny nose and sore throat. At 75mg I experienced severe depression, cycling through mania. It felt as if my body was in autopilot, and I was along for the ride. It was as if I was merely observing my instability and could not control it even if I tried. I went back down to 50mg and have been on it for 2 months. My hypervigilance is still under control but this is because my constant emotional arousal has been replaced by soul shattering apathy. This medication is very effective, just not for me due to the side effects.",5

It has been a really lifesaver, since I have take more than 3 antidepressants before with little or no improvement. I feel I am getting connected again with myself.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"The way lamictal works faster or slow is due to your metabolism. I could go up doses very fast without having the rash but wow I suffered so much while going through this process. It does get worse before it gets better. Once you get to the therapeutic dose then things start to improve. Now; some of us have vivid dreams. Scary sometimes but you get used to them. Also it took me at least 5 months until I got its full benefit. And it may cause you insomnia, need some ambien for that. Ambien stopped working after 5 months. And so when I tried melatonin it worked pretty well. Melatonin didn't work in the first months on this Drug. Only worked after the 5 months and then after few 2 months I didn't need it anymore. I was sleeping well without it.",10
Mandarinmocha,"June 10, 2011",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Before I started taking this medicine, my moods were up and down, anger, anxiety, not sleeping at night, back pain, fear of leaving the house, etc. This medicine has changed my life completely. I don't feel like the same person. I never enjoyed living the way that I do now. I'm up early in the mornings, doing things and being productive, which is so different from what I used to. Thanks to this medicine, I'm actually living. I've tried so many things and nothing else works. Miracle by far. No anxiety, no sleep problems, energy, and relationships are improving so well.",10
jb,"October 30, 2019",For Anxiety:,"I've been on this for years. I am a stroke survivor and thought my very bad hand tremors were due to stroke. No, they were made much worse by lamotrigine. I thought so though one doctor said not. I have cut down very gradually to 25mgs from 200mg (taken about a year) and the withdrawal has been horrible once at about 50 to 75- exhaustion, anxiety and bad gut aches and obsessive thoughts. Almost as bad as SSRI withdrawal. So I am eventually stopping altogether. I have now tried virtually every mood disorder/anxiety/depression med so will just have to use much more cognitive techniques. I also take inderal and clonazepam (.5 once a day). I know I am addicted to clonazepam but I feel I have little choice given that my anxiety was very severe leading to inability to work at all. I'm sure that lamotrigine helps many people . I caution people if you  discontinued,  then go slow. Hopefully now I will be able to eat with one hand as the shaking will lessen.",1
,,For Depression:,Update. Since June 2021 I have titrated up to 200 mg after suffering a severe episode of MDD.  Lamictal literally saved my life. I was depressed to the point of being actively suicidal and borderline non-functional.  My depression has completely lifted.  It is like tons of weight have been lifted from me.  NO SIDE EFFECTS FOR ME AT ALL.  Lamictal was a last resort for me with the only other option being ketamine.  I realize this is not for everyone but it has worked wonders for me.,10
Jessica Geese,"October 27, 2015",For Depression:,"Thank you all for sharing. I am currently taking Lamictal for pain, because the side benefit is actually pain relief for peripheral neuropathy.

Has anyone else had increased depression?",
,,For Depression:,"I recently started lamictal about 4 days ago 100mgs a day. So far its done nothing but heightened my anger and make me cry. I need a miracle here.

I  was told and have read that this is a great  medicine and begged my Dr to put me on it. My anxiety is so horrible I still have extreme suicidal thoughts  and  feel empty, I've had so many different diagnosis I honestly don't know what I have. Please advice?",2
,,For Depression:,"SSRIs stopped working and gave me fibromyalgia. My stomach lining was burning, but that might have been the Remeron or the combination. Lamotrigine reduced my depression 50-100%. Not sure why some days are better than others. My fear/anxiety is much much worse. I can barely eat. My memory is terrible so I can't remember my memory prior to lamotrigine! I suspect these symptoms are caused by it but I can't be sure.  I've lost my appetite twice prior to taking it, but never this bad. Night terrors but I can't remember if I had them prior.",5
,,For Depression:,If you suffer from depression this might be a medicine to take. It very helpful in controlling your symptoms.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Seizure Prevention:,"I have been on Lamictal now for 15 years.   We started at around 600 mg/day,but gradually reduced this to 250 g/day,and then after a couple of small seizures this was upped to 300g and I now take200 g at night and 100g in the morning. My doctor says Lamictal dosage must be minimum 250 g  day to be effective, with a maxi dosage possible of 1 200 g / day.  We did try some Lamictal plus Keppra onthe way,but reverted tojust Lamictal and that was fine.  I have had very few seizures since I started - maybe once every3 years - but recently got 2 when I went to Australia and had had a 30 hour trip.  Stress and alcohol are linked to my attacks.  I have very light epilepsy discovered at age 32.  I am very happy with it",10
,,For Depression:,"Looking back, I think I've had anxiety and depression most of my life. When I started to have mood swings and also feel like crying almost every day, I finally decided to seek treatment. This was about 5 years ago. The generics for Welbutrin and Lexapro helped, but I still had many times when I was depressed and somewhat suicidal. My psychiatrist tried prescribing several add-on meds, but either they weren't effective or caused side effects like weight gain. I am now on 100 mg of lamotrigine, and I don't think I've ever felt better! I am cheerful, motivated and feel like myself, without anxiety or depression. Only side effect is that  I sometimes feel itchy on my scalp, arms or legs. No rash.",9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have Bipolar II and lamotrigine saved my life. I have taken 200mg for approximately 5 years. In combination with therapy my mood swings have diminished by >95%. My quality of life has skyrocketed. My life truly is broken into 2 segments - before lamotrigine and after lamotrigine.

My memory is certainly a bit worse, but I notice no other side effects. The memory impairment is not substantial enough to warrant stopping the medication.",10
,,For Cyclothymic Disorder:,"At 49, I saw a psychiatrist for the first time after realizing that I most likely had a mood disorder (cyclothymia).  He put me on Lamictal, upped my Neurontin to 1800 mg (600mg TID) for my anxiety and prescribed me with Zyprexa for mania as a PRN. The Lamictal had an immediate effect and completely eliminated my low grade moods.  I mean they are totally gone!   No more brooding, no more pessimism, no more days of isolation and a marked improvement of my overall mood including a better sense of well being.  

So people with mood disorders question whether it is the medication that makes them feel better.  In my situation, I am clear that it is the medication that helps me.  I will stay on Lamictal for the rest of my life to help regulate my mood.  I know it helps. 

BTW, the Neurontin has almost completely eliminated my anxiety problems. I still have anxiety, but now it is much more in the realm of ""normal.""",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"So I have been in a really severe depressive state for the past 8 months. Feeling hopeless, anxious and destroyed. I was agitated and anxious the whole time. I was blaming myself for everything happening in my life. 6 weeks ago I decided to go see a psychiatrist because my social anxiety was worse than ever before. He diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on Lamictal and abilify. I am now taking 125mg Lamictal and 15mg abilify. I honestly think that lamictal has calmed me down a bit. I am no longer agitated but still anxious. My social anxiety is still there and it’s getting worse. But I am slightly in peace with myself and no more blaming. The thing that concerns me the most is the social anxiety. I hope it fades away as I up my dosage.",7
Evie,"September 5, 2018",For Cyclothymic Disorder:,"Lamictal has changed my life. I struggled for years trying to find the right medications just so I didn’t have to wake up every single morning wishing I didn’t exist, followed by erratic, unpredictable mood swings which affected my personal life on a daily basis. I thought because my problem was primarily symptoms of depression, an SSRI may work. Fortunately it did for several months but then gradually stopped working. Eventually my therapist convinced me to talk to my doctor about my mood swings, which I was leery about because I knew I didn’t fit the profile for BPD. Although I still don’t have an exact diagnosis, I am SO GLAD I am taking lamictal. I thought my SSRI made me feel better, but lamictal transformed my life. I have a better, more stable relationship with everyone in my life & I feel like I can handle all the highs and lows in my life as a neurotypical, healthy person would. Lamictal has given me hope for the future and I am forever grateful for this drug.",10
CanBx,"December 10, 2009",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Seizure Prevention:,"I've been taking Lamictal for 7 months for seizures. It was prescribed by the Neurologist. One month after I started taking Lamictal, I suffered a stroke with an epilepsy attack. From day one, I told my doctor about all the stomach ache from taking Lamictal. She did not stop or changed the medication and now after having a biopsy to the stomach, it was found to be caused by Lamictal. I try to tell the doctor but she refuses to accept that Lamictal was causing my stomach aches. Lamictal is the only medication I am taking.",1
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This was the first mood stabilizer I was put on when I was diagnosed BP2 and I've been on it ever since, which was about 9 years ago. I love this med- I've had NO side effects. I'm on 500mg which is a very high dose but I'm also very treatment resistant. The only negative thing about this med is that I can't go on birth control. I have horrible mood swings and pain around 'that time' and birth control would help, but besides it lessening the effect of the birth control it also lessens the effectiveness of lamictal. There may be some birth control pill out there I can take, but my pdoc, and gyno haven't found it. :( Besides that this med is amazing & I'll never go off of it",10
,,For Migraine Prevention:,"Lamotrigine changed my life. I suffered from severe migraine since I was a teenager, the majority of the time. This drug has entirely eliminated my migraine for about 10 years. The first medication I tried was topamax  and I experienced a trippy feeling, as though I had been drugged. Next I tried Lamictal and developed a serious rash. My doctor somehow convinced me to try again, with a low dose of lamotrigine. I did not experience any side effects with lamictal and it helped tremendously. Over time my dose has increased to 100mg once per day, still a rather low dose. I’m amazed that after a lifetime of suffering with migraine, a low dose of lamotrigine, once a day, can have such a huge impact, it truly changed my life.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on 200mg of lamotrigine for 5 years. I also take 50mg of seroquel at bedtime which also helps immensely with my insomnia. And yes, it took a moment to pull that last word our of my brain and I do goof up words sometimes, but so do all the other alcoholics I know and love. I self medicated for many years and it worked even better after quitting 2 years ago. I still am a little manic, and vaguely depressed under stress, but this treatment has been a lifesaver. I highly recommend giving it a try if your unhappy with your current regimen, but you'll have to give it time. It took me about 6 months to get the full benefit.",9
Shay1377,"February 10, 2014",For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I immediately noticed how it balanced out my moods to a more stable baseline and helped with early morning depression and afternoon depression mood swings. 
The more I increased the dosage, the better the results. I currently take 150mg daily. I find it more beneficial to split the dosage between morning and afternoon. 
Although I still have impulsive behaviors. I don't expect pharmaceuticals to be the cure all and therapy should help minimize my impulsive reactions.

I take 200mg at night and 200mg in the morning. I too experience memory loss and concentration. I feel as though my eyes don't move normally. Since my dosage was upped I find myself in slow motion. I also notice that I have a form of dyslexia. example: putting on my windshield wipers instead of my blinkers. another example is: when I'm speaking I might say into my sentence what I'm looking at. Talk about makes me feel stupid! I must add that I also take Zonagram which was causing me other side effects like depression and suicidal.

Now at 200mg a day, it has not been as bad, but still significant. My memory has gotten almost to the point of giving up the medicine because it's so bad. I also have trouble thinking of words that I want to say and have never had that problem until taking Lamictal.  It does have less or (better) side effects than some of the others, or I would have tried something else by now.",8

,,For Depression:,"I was started on this med for depression from having no life from getting moderate-severe chronic fatigue syndrome. I can't say this has given my life back or anything but its the only thing that helps with my energy without causing flares like stimulants do. Caffeine is like taking out a loan I have to pay back with interest, if it helps at all. This is the only thing I've found that helps my baseline. 

I take 150mg a day in the morning. Many people find this sedating, but to me its the opposite. In fact, I can't consistently take any more than 150 because it ups my anxiety at 200mg and above.

I'm still disabled, but this is the only thing I've found that bumps my baseline up (and I've tried every supplement and med imaginable).",8

I was chronically late, my whole adult life. I lost almost every job I had due to lateness. I had other ADHD symptoms, but that was not my diagnosis. Guess I thought all those things were just character flaws.

Reduces overall depression, SI, obsessions and anxiety. Slowly went to 200mg/day as I couldn't feel much difference at 100.

After the first week, I switched back to mornings.  A few days after my first dose I felt calm, not moody.  After a week at each dose I felt the need to increase because I could feel my moodiness returning.  I am throwing out things that remind me of traumatic events.  I'll need to increase past 100mg to get more relief from my depression.  No sexual side effects; no rash; no effect on my menstrual cycle; mild nausea that doesn't last all day; mild decrease in appetite; have lost a few pounds; thoughts that trigger my OCD are still there but but I can see when I am about to engage in an OCD ritual; rage is better; no explosive outbursts in several weeks.",9

As for panic attacks and mood swings, this medication is a freakin god send. Before this medication I had a really short fuse and at any minute I could explode with rage one minute and cry hysterically the next, I would have panic attacks in public places and would physically collapse, this medication has helped control that. I still feel like rubbish most of the time, but at least on the surface I react to things a lot more patiently and with less rage.

Haven’t found a single antidepressant that helps (and I think I’ve pretty much tried them all), but when I started Lamictal years ago, It truly saved my life. I experienced a dramatic change in mood and everything became manageable. 
My anxiety and depression have been  worsening in the last year and I’m at a very low place and I’m a mess. I’m going to ask doc about increasing Lamictal by at least more 100mg. I want my life back.

Petite and sensitive to medication, I have done well on 50mg lamictal daily. This medication has brought so much RELIEF! Excellent addition to the wellbutrin.  I deal mostly with depression, but also have been very mood sensitive and can be easily ""sent over the edge."" This medication brings me peace and well being.  Having to deal with emotional instability is very stressful and burdensome (for me and those I love).  That burden is lifted, as the range of emotions that I have are much more manageable.  Less worrying if I am going to have an outburst, which means less shame to deal with.  No major symptoms other than very brief, occasional, and mild nausea after I eat.  Overall it has made a huge improvement to my quality of life.  If you are in need of a stabilizer I hope it works for you!",8

It has also reduced frequency and intensity of panic attacks, no more tremors (might be due to addition of proprananol). I feel I should have been on this for years before now.

I understood my illness is genetic Bc my uncle had it and my dad has it but don't accept it I guess. Anyway 70% of cases have a genetic background so feel better about that. You didn't chose this. I feel Lamictal is not working as well after two years but not a major change. I will increase it from 200mg to 250 this week. I control my depression with clonazepan.

I HAVE MY ARM BACK AND CAN DRIVE AGAIN! My mood has been much better, and I see the world as an opportunity, rather than a reason to stay in bed.

I still have to make sure I'm getting regular exercise, eating well, getting enough sleep, spending time in the mountains and in the sun, and showering regularly; if I don't, I will cycle back into a depressive episode. I know this is probably common for the general population, but I wanted to make it clear that before, those activities wouldn't curb my depression in any way. I give this 9/10 as it has caused my eye sight to decline, have noticed some gum recession, some sexual side effects, as well as some hair loss (supplementing with selenium has helped).",9

Anonymous,"September 10, 2010",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Before starting Lamictal I'd been hospitalized 5 times for rapid cycling bipolar disorder 1, made one serious suicide attempt, and had more than 50 ECT treatments.  I've been on almost every mood stabilizer, antidepressant and antipsychotics.  Lamictal has been the most helpful, and has made me feel like almost a normal person- living and back to professional life. Side effects; hair thin, nails okay.  Sometimes memory, and concentration problems- but hey, I did have a lot of shock therapy.  Once I had sudden, severe double vision that lasted several hours.  Overall has been most effective with best side effects for me, smoother moods, less severe, better weight, better skin, better libido, better gastrointestinal effects than lithium, other mood stabilizers or antipsychotics.",
,,For Depression:,"After being diagnosed with MDD, I was hospitalized for three weeks and begun on a series of ECT treatments that got me well enough to be out on the street. I then spent 2-1/2 years in outpatient therapy that was a total waste of my time. A psych APRN at the VA put me on Lamotrigine. It along with some excellent therapy got me feel better and stop the suicidal thoughts that had filled my brain for almost three years. I started on 200mg/day in 2015 and have stayed on the same dose since then.  I would rate it 10 out of 10 for effectiveness with the results beginning a week after starting it",10
,,For Depression:,"I have  Bipolar, several anxiety issues, OCDs, PTSD, trichotillomania, depression with some psychotic symptoms etc. If your conditions are quite severe, there is only so much a single medication can do. However, for me, lamotrigine has built a foundation which reduces my severe depression (suicidal most of 2018, due to bipolar & anxiety getting much worse, totally disabling), with no side effects except maybe it is a little harder to fall asleep (but I have intrusive images & flashbacks when trying to fall asleep anyway). I am still depressed, but not frighteningly so now. I have taken so many meds with so many terrible side effects, so having virtually none on this is a rare miracle. It does little for PTSD or anxiety or OCDs for me - well it helps after I've just taken it (and gives me back energy depression destroyed), but this only lasts 2-3 hours. Maybe I just need a lot more? (Already on target dose).",9

It is the gold standard in treating BP depression and was instantly effective for me. My depression diminished, my mood elevated, I had little to no side effect; but my hypomania did not seem to be affected.

,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have been on Lamotrigine for a month now, titrated up to 100mg. Even with 25mg I could start to notice some effect. I think it was not quite the therapeutic dose and still had my issues related to PTSD like anger, rumination, disassociation. With 100mg it’s really starting to be noticeable. My coping techniques in therapy seem possible for once. Before they felt like a lost cause because if I was fully triggered everything would go out the door. Now I can really reel it in. I have a lot more space in my brain to process my traumas. I’m ok with feeling my emotions because I’m not so disassociated or triggered. It seemed to break my coping via alcohol. I stopped isolating. This really should be considered a first line medication for PTSD. I had to take 8 or 9 different medications to get here. But this one feels like the winner. It’s markedly different than anything I’ve taken. Added benefit: ZERO side effects!",10

I’ve been able to hold a relationship and get married while enjoying life. The medication started with itchy bumps on feet and elbows. But this goes away.

I'm giving it 7 of 10 stars because it doesn't work for bipolar 1 as a mono-therapy and has effected my memory and ability to recall words and to read quickly.

I've spent the last 3 to 4 years in constant turmoil, jumping from medication to medication, trying various cocktails. Most of these had major side ffects that made them unbearable in the long run.

We tried it all she was also committed twice for mania and depression. Her new Psych put her on lithium last year and it stopped the mania, but no SSRI would pull her out of the severe depression she was in for so long and she tried like eight different ones!
Finally she got prescribed Lamictal and within a week she was her old self, happy, no more mixed episodes, no more sadness and she was humming and laughing.  She said she felt like the last six years were a blur. She had to titrate slowly and she is only on 50 mg right now, but man what a difference.

Yet, the first two weeks I had two seizures, so my doctor decided to put me on 1000mg of Keppra. I've had a few more seizures on lamictal and it was very random. I believe that lamictal is not beneficial by itself, but combined with another drug, it seems to help out. Although it helps a little bit, the side effects are fatigue, weakness and low appetite.

Since then, I've cycled through pretty much every SSRI available and have never felt a noticeably positive difference. Thankfully, my doctor was more than open to my idea to switch to a mood stabilizer and prescribed Lamictal. Before this I felt like I was constantly reliving my trauma, and that mostly manifested as extreme anger and irritation largely directed at those closest to me.

ErinW,"October 26, 2009",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal has been a lifesaving mood stabilizer for me. The only serious downside is that it causes what I call 'old lady skin'- thin, fragile, and poor healing, as well as mucous membrane fragility. 

I initially did very well on 200 mg and suddenly developed severe rash eight months in (rare for it to take that long). I successfully (and slowly) rechallenged, and 200mg is where the skin issues kick in. I'm back down to 150mg and my slow-healing bug bites from the summer are finally fading away!

HOWEVER, even if I had skin like the Crypt Keeper for the rest of my days, I can't praise Lamictal enough. It gave me my life back. What's a little skin in exchange?",9
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"There has never been a better medication for me to help contain my moods. I am a very emotional person and go from one extreme to the other from morning to night. My doctor says I am not bipolar, but that I have borderline personality disorder. I am also anorexic. This medication helps manage my mood. I would not be able to go from day to day without this! I have been on 225mgs for 5 years. No side effects that I am aware of. I wish I could go higher on the dose but it interferes with birth control medication (estrogen).",10

M joints would ache and I couldn't take it anymore. My doctor switched me to Topamax and I can really tell a difference!

,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,I've been on lamotrigine for complex ptsd for just under 3 weeks. The first two weeks I was on 50 mg now I'm on 100mg...seems to be doing its job. I did have a very slight hive like rash first day both when I started and when I raised my dose but the passed in about ten minutes. The main thing I has noticed is the racing and looping thought patterns have greatly reduced. I also have a slight hyper activity but I just put that down to my natural self. All in all I'm glad I finally took a medication as in the past it was anti depressants and anti anxiety drugs which didn't help me at all.,9

It is life changing! Before my head was overwhelmed with many thoughts processing, many of which were negative, angry thoughts, and now my head is calm and quiet. My thoughts are now all positive and nice. I don't think I could say mean things even if I wanted to because literally my brain blocks it! My anxiety has gone away too, what a great feeling! I had no negative side effects. I was told it may cause weight loss and memory loss, BUT since my head is much more relaxed without anxiety I have started to eat normal again and I have actually had improved memory.",10

He discussed using Lamotigine and steadily increasing the dose over the next year to reduce the anger, anxiety and hopelessness that had come over me.

I am currently on 100 mg and feeling great after continuing college, earning the highest GPA I ever earned, obtaining a new personal training job and meeting a very beautiful girl...I guess that's success.

I thought everything might be a side effect, but I stuck it out and when I hit 150mg it was immediately clear that something had changed. In the past I would say my time in a state of normalcy was about 40%? Now it’s about 80% and even though I still drift towards depressive and hypomanic moods, they only last about 2 days and I’m very aware of what’s happening. Since I’m more aware, I’m able to avoid doing anything damaging and able to know that the mood is going to end.

I don't get manic episodes at all (apart from some mild hypomania), which has been a big help on my social life. I also don't get manic --> depressed crashes (because, no manic episode).
 The only downsides have been I found it doesn't help with my sleep and because it stabilises so well and I have always struggled with depression, it can keep me stable but at a very low mood. In those cases I have used it with an SNRI and felt much better. 
Also I had very few side effects (apart from sleep and feeling a bit head-coldy when not actually sick), and if I'm consistent with my medication can finally feel and function as basically neurotypical :)

I am now on Lamotrigine and I have all the side effects : insomnia, acne problem, low concentration, bad memory , can’t stand light or noise. I am refusing to take more than 100mg a day for that reason. I am so scared to get another seizure (I didn’t have any since then but I have huge headache/migraines almost everyday) that I don’t want to stop them yet . But it changes who I am completely.

I started at half a 25mg pill, so 12.5mg, for two weeks, bumped up to 25mg for two weeks, and have been 50mg a day for the remainder. I had minimal side effects. Some nausea about an hour after taking my dose, which went away in about another hour and then I was just hungry. That only lasted about a week after each dose increase.

I feel like a normal human being now. From time to time I would get sad, but it is not anywhere close to what it used to be. This drug is amazing.

When I was trying ADs, the Klonopin barely seemed to work for sleep, I still take Klonopin for sleep but at least I can sleep through the night now.  Nice being off the ADs.  Hope this one works long-term and I can get off the Klonopin eventually which I think is causing my moderate brain fog.  Eh, life is much better than it was.  I recommend it!",9

So, I went back up to 300 mg and what a difference. My only side effects and yawning and sleepiness but a couple of cups of coffee knocks out.

,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,Really wanted this medication to work for me since it doesn’t cause weight gain... for the most part my mood did level out but the side effects were unbearable for me so I am now slowly going off it.

I am giving up now unfortunately.,5

After being on low-dose Abilify and Seroquel to sleep for a few weeks, I was not really manic anymore (maybe hypo-, or had some manic symptoms- like usual, e.g. destructibility). Then I started lamotrigine, now on 100mg/day. I increased venlafaxine back to 225mg expecting to go manic, but instead I feel clear-headed. Friends have noticed I don't lose my train of thought often, and that I ""seem more stable"". I have been diagnosed Bipolar I, but am ""more like a II,"" which I agree with. I also have Social Anxiety Disorder (and used to have the most severe depression imaginable). The Bipolar might be caused by S.P. Seizures.",9

Before you consider going up a dose its worth considering. When you take them? I began taking  mine at night, but have since taking  through the day avoids headache, vision blurred, tremours. I take more last dose, breakfast, lunch & dinner. 
Do you take them food?I take them with food, I defiantly feel side effect, every time if I don't eat properly and skiip a meal
Are you on any hormone treatment hrt/pill? I have found that there is a, as I call it, lower absorption rate as I'm on hrt and my consultant phy agrees, so I am taking a high does.What dosage?

Suffered since teenager, thought to be ADD and anxiety. After traumatic divorce (my ex was a drug addict), professionals diagnosed me with cyclothymia. Was afraid to go on meds, being sensitive to drugs, and bad time with the pill. I started taking Lithium- felt fatigued, dehydrated and weird appetite. Switched to Wellbutin, made me lethargic and gave severe brain fog. As a writer and artist, I need to feel things! 5 months ago, a horribly bad week made me willing to try anything. Started @ 25 mg, raised by 25mg every 2 weeks until 200mg. I feel amazing, my life and work have blossomed! Feel grateful to be alive!",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Seizure Prevention:,My daughter started this drug at night time with the lowest dose.  2 weeks later we added another dose in the morning.   On the second day she started having more seizures (absense) in the morning where as before she had maybe 20 but with the medication it was in the hundreds.   I told her dr and they wanted us to just double up the dose at night time.   I wasn’t ok with that but kept her on the  1 chew pill at night.  The next day she has a convulsion seizure which she had never had before.   I don’t like this medication.  I think it caused more seizures for my 6 year old little girl.,1

Tyrell,"January 30, 2020",For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I was on Zoloft 100mg & Buspirone 15mg for depression/anxiety before I went to a psychiatrist who recommended a mood stabilizer Lamictal 100mg 2x a day. I weaned myself off all 3 cuz I was feeling wonderful/stabile. it only took 2-3 months and my behavior was back major mood swings, sadness, depression, and alcoholism was back full blast. I did a lot of damage to relationships & my health. I have been put back on Lamictal 200mg again and  in 6 weeks I’m at peace & rational. I have no side effects except decreased libido. That is a blessing right now cuz multiple sexual partners was a struggle while off meds. I’m going to go back on Zoloft because I need more antidepressant than what Lamictal offers. I still feel melancholy and random crying over happy & sad things. I TRULY RECOMMEND LAMICTAL with other medications such as antidepressants and anti anxiety’s! It is worth your time to try it!",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamictal had done wonders for me. It took a while for me to get up to a therapeutic dose, but it's helped with my bipolar depression so much, with no side effects. My only complaint is that you have to build up the doses, starting with 25 mg, and going up from there. I'm currently on 200 mg and still going up!",9
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"This med really did save my life! I didn’t know how much I needed it until I was on it. If you suffer from mood cycles then this will be so impactful on your life. I feel grounded in a way I never thought possible. I can get through my day without finding something to sob about. I can clean my house and not spend 6 hours working myself up to it. I can make decisions without being completely driven by emotion. But greatest of all, I am HAPPY.",10
,,For Depression:,"Lamictal is the most consistent antidepressant medication that I have ever taken. I have had severe depression for many years now — nothing that I have taken has worked (Several SSRIs, Wellbutrin, ect).

BUT as the years have passed, my memory has been going a lot and it seems to be getting worse and worse. I took it upon myself to stop the medicine cold turkey (I'd  been on for 5-6 years now so its NOT recommended).. and yet I haven't had any symptoms of a seizure and my memory is starting to come back. My sister was also on it but for depression, she almost lost her eye sight because she missed 1 day of taking it. So please be careful, and do your research on each drug that you are about to go on.",6
,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have been taking lamotrigine for two weeks now (PTSD) and my psychiatrist wants me to up it every week until I hit 100 mg.  I’m on week 2 at 50 mg and I feel much calmer.  My anxiety is a bit higher and I tend to overthink about small situations, my vision is a bit more blurry (which sucks cuz I’m already blind as a bat lol!) and my balance and coordination is off.
But overall I’m in a better mood, no panic attacks, no flashbacks or negative feelings. I’m much more patient with my kids and I actually want to do more with them now than I have before.  I recommend this medication to others to try for PTSD or any other reason they have it available for.    I can’t wait to see how I feel on 100 mg and once these side effects calm down, if they ever do.   In the end the side effects are worth the outcome of the medication",10

Quit lamictal and it was gone.. When I saw my doctor I told her and she said yes that is a side affect and I could never take again.. OMG.. Best med ever for bipolar..

For one year I felt like a guinea pig, taking different medications, increasing & decreasing them. I felt like I would never feel better. My doctor started me on Lamictal after a really bad episode & it worked within two weeks. I am on Lamictal 50 mg a day & zoloft 100mg a day. I feel like a new person. I do not cycle all of the time now & only cry when it’s actually something sad to cry about & not all of the time. My anxiety is next to nothing anymore. This medication has been a life saver for me.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Schizoaffective Disorder:,"I've been on Lamotrigine for several months now, started a small dosage of 25mg, gradually increasing until I've gotten to 300mg per night. Each increase has improved my mood, made me content and more active. It has also taken away my depressed behavior of lying in bed watching TV series all day and overeating, as well as my sudden breakouts of irritation. I just hope I don't get the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, I don't know if the risk is less the more you've taken the medication without side-effects. Getting SJS would be extremely unfortunate given that I greatly depend on the medication.",9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"After my diagnosis, the first trial of medication I was prescribed was Lamictal, and shortly after, Seroquel. Being 18 at the time, I didn't take it seriously enough at the time, so I didn't take my medication as I was supposed to.
I went through 8 trials since that time (9 years). Antipsychotics made me gain TONS of weight, so I took myself off all the ones I had been given trials of. Antidepressants made the condition noticeably much, much worse (I don't recommend them for Bipolarpatients).
In 2016, I began to take my Bipolar seriously, and 2 years later, I have never been in a better place. It doesn't help every aspect of BP1, but the duration of time between episodes are so much longer, as well as the severity of the mania or depression being much less intense. No negative side effects, either. Regardless of the episodes I inevitably get, this medication saved my life.",9
,,For Schizoaffective Disorder:,"Lamotrigine has worked wonders for my mood. It’s been a difficult road to finding the right medication, but I think this is the one. It took some time to adjust to it, but once it started to work it really worked for me. I have schizoaffective disorder",10
Mikasa,"May 12, 2015",For Anxiety:,"I'm taking this medication for anxiety and mood swings. It really does close to nothing with my anxiety. It helps my moods a bit but my anxiety is more bothersome. Not only that, my memory is complete crap. I have trouble finding words, memorizing new information and spelling. I am a great speller and ever since I started taking Lamictal, I've forgotten to spell some words which i would have no problem with before. Overall, I feel this med is doing more bad than good. I started taking Seroquel and I can already feel more positive changes than Lamictal has done since I started taking it.",2
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I have generalized anxiety disorder along with OCD, depression, PTSD & weird/strong/angry mood swings. I am not bipolar but this medication keeps me under control. It helps my anxiety more than anything, I do get random ""freak out"" moments where I'll simply just want to go crazy on someone or something. So although I don't know exactly what this medication is helping me with, it's helping me overall be a better person with less (but still rare) mood swings. I'd recommend this med to anyone with any anxiety disorder, etc!",8
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,I can’t believe the miracle this drug has been for me. A lifetime of hospitalizations and suffering. I have been diagnosed incorrectly with about every psychiatric disorder know to man. Have been on just about every drug for depression starting at 23 years old. Finally my depression and irritation became so crippling that I considered ending my life again. My care provider believes I have a bipolar II disorder and prescribed lamotrigine. Within a day I noticed a huge change in my mood. The irritability and depression became much better and I feel like living for the first time in my life. My issues with  insomnia have gotten worse but I will deal with that. I believe I have been given the chance to live the remaining years of my life in peace. Truly an answer to my prayers.,10

It did somewhat decrease my agitated anxiety, but did not help with my obsessive ruminations. Aside from the depressed mood and mild sedation, I didn't notice any side effects.

It has changed my life so drastically. I went from living on an emotional rollercoster of rage and outbursts to being in control of my emotions and behaving responsibly. Unfortunately, the medication has caused me to get a disorder called Neutropenia, which is an abnormally low white blood cell count. This means that I've become more susceptible to disease and infection. This has been very difficult and frustrating news because up until this point I was praising Lamictal as a miracle drug and now I'm forced to get off the drug due to the Neutropenia.

I now have been at the same job for 3 years, got promoted and got sober. Things that I never thought possible before I started on lamictal.

I hope any of you suffering have the same results. Please don't give up!,10

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"LAMOTRIGINE SAVED MY LIFE! In the span of 6 months I had gone through hypomania, depression, and a mixed episode. I was off the walls, irritable, impulsive, and eventually spiraled to rock bottom. Relapsed in my eating disorder and self injury, increased drug use, attempted suicide, and almost hospitalized an additional three times. Insomnia, crippling anxiety, panic attacks, and a sense of impending doom. Had an intervention and ended up seeing a psychiatrist where I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. I had been suffering for years and did not know it was Bipolar. Prescribed Lamotrigine and it pulled me out of the worst depressive episode I’ve ever experienced. Anxiety and irritability is minimal, depression is gone. I don't randomly cry anymore. Eating disorder is in remission. I’m finally stabilized and functional. I’ve had literally NO side effects from this med. I started on 25mg for two weeks then had a dose increase to 50mg. I can't say enough how grateful I am for this med!!!!",10

Finally I went back to 200mgs and decided to just live with the nighttime seizures. my dr suggested using Xanax to control them. It worked. The odd part that they occur every six weeks like and last for about a week... Anybody else has such regular onset?",8

I haven't had a grandmal for years now, thankfully, but myoclonic seizures still happen frequently.",7
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"This medication changed my life. I was severely depressed and regularly prescribed antidepressants were not cutting it despite being on them for several months. Lamictal (I take the generic version lamotrogine) has changed my life. Even though this med is mainly used to treat bipolar disorder, I can definitely say that it helps with the extreme lows of depression. This med was a god send. I would highly recommend you mention this drug to your doctor if no other antidepressant is effectively working for you!",10
,,For Depression:,"I was on Celexa and Buspar for about 15 years - no highs, no lows, but felt after that long I should try something new.  I started with lamictal @ 25mg while I was lowering my Celexa and Buspar.  First two weeks were almost euphoric.  Then I stepped up to 50mg (again while decreasing my other meds), and I started seeing things.  I googled this and found others were experiencing the same issue.  Then I stepped up to 75mg, and my world fell apart.  Dizziness, hostility, itching, ""buzzing"", sleep issues, nausea and uncontrollable sobbing.  I'm stepping down now, but it has been a 6-week process.  Now I've been prescribed  meds to calm the dizziness and nausea, and I'm still stepping down while going back on Celexa.  Great when it works...a complete nightmare when it doesn't.",

My dizzy spells are rare, straight lines aren't difficult and best of all my memory is coming back. It's not as good as  before I was on the meds, but I'm happy for anything I can get.  My issue is that I'm soon going on Medicare and the cost of this medicine is $12,000/yr.  I'm looking into generics and based on the research it seems they have gotten better, but I'm not ready to make the leap yet.",8

Generic and name brand are NOT the same thing.",10
,,For Depression:,"Like so many people on this site, my life has been transformed by Lamictal. I have suffered from depression since my early teens and throughout my life. I have had serious Complex PTSD and became very mentally ill with violent outbursts, psychosis and suicide attempts. After seeing a psychiatrist following another major depressive épisode where I lost 15 kgs in 3 weeks,I was prescribed Lamictal on top of the SSRI  I had been on. Within five weeks, I felt so much calmer. 18 months later dose is being upped to 150mg and my SSRI reduced. I feel like a normal, stable person after years of trauma which almost killed me. Lamictal and therapy have definitely saved my life.",10

I was misdiagnosed several yrs back as ADHD. They prescribed  adderall for over a year, which made me manic and I became addicted. Terrible experience. I waited 2 yrs and was terrified to take my therapists suggestion of trying lamotrigine to stabilize my mood after diagnosing me as bipolar. I started taking it 4 months ago after a major manic episode and I can't believe the difference. My anxiety and depression is gone and moods are stable. I keep waiting for the shoe to drop but I've been stable since starting it. A miracle I'll tell you! I had headaches the first couple months and heightened sex drive but now I feel normal.",10

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but no mention of Bi Polar.  My severe mood swings were affecting everything in my life. My relationship with my husband, kids, my lack of motivation.

I am also diagnosed with Post traumatic Stress Disorder. I have noticed Lamotrigine helped tremendously with my symptoms of hypervigilance, which are much less severe today.

It also helps me with depressive episodes. I rarely fall into depressive states where I can not function, and when I do, they are much shorter than they used to last.

Sadly I haven't seen any improvement in avoidance symptoms, but I didn't expect it to help this symptom of PTSD in the first place.

It might also be important to note that I don't have a history of manic symptoms.",8

After slowly increasing the dosage on Lamictal, I started feeling better.  I got out of bed.  After about 2 months, I'm back to normal, no tears, sleeping only 8 or 9 hours instead of 12, going to yoga 5 times a week instead of watching Law and Order SVU reruns.

,,For Migraine Prevention:,"This med took about 2 years to take full effect. I have been taking 200mg for 12 years. I have to take in the morning, night dose makes it wear off too soon. (Increasing chance of migraines)

Pros;  I Went from weekly migraines (hemiplegic, cortical depression,  pain) to 2-6 per year, now only Brought on by extreme stress and/or extreme wind. I unexpectedly became more easy going, I no longer sweat the small stuff. 

Cons; Lamictal has extreme and terrifying withdrawals, I can tell when I've missed a dose by vibrations in my teeth and face, and if longer than 48 hours I get extreme fear, headache, double vision, debilitating sadness, and super hypersensitive to sound. Less severe is hair loss, but so worth the life without severe migraines",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamotrigine has been pretty good along with lithium (bipolar).  Have been on 200Mg for 3 years and lithium for 15.   I decided to ramp up lamotrigine to 400 mg and I had more energy and zest and best moods but also had more anxiety, math/memory issues, and a touch of hypomania.  However, I did have incredible orgasms!!!   Back down to 300mg and I am experiencing a bit more depression but seem to be pretty level.  Lamotrigine seems to lessen the severity of my depressive episodes but does not eliminate them.  It helps me enough to stay on it.",8

Brought me out of a depressive episode and I've been very content with this medicine. Feels like it fits just for me after many trials and errors with antidepressants. Definitely feels like a veil has been lifted off me and the world even seems happier. I do have my off days , but they are just days and not weeks.

However, it gave me really bad back acne (like, whoa) and made me very physically ill- super swollen lymph nodes in my neck, fever, vomiting & fatigue, etc. I had to stop taking it, but I'd say it's definitely worth a try. In general I'm very susceptible to side effects.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"After experiencing severe depression since middle school, I had been misdiagnosed and prescribed several different antidepressants, which only made my then-undiagnosed Bipolar Disorder worse. Finally in 2007 I was correctly diagnosed with a mixed/manic episode, and began taking Lamictal. I have had zero side effects whatsoever, and it stabilized my mood swings immediately. I am now supposed to take 200mg twice a day, but after 5  years of the icky-tasting pill, I tend to skip doses every couple of days. Probably as a result, my depression has come back, but at least I haven't experienced the manic/mixed episodes that I used to have before Lamictal! I can truly say that this medication is a lifesaver, although it seems to have ""worn off"". ",9

It can't be said more about the pain, torture, anxiety, shame, and ... that come with constantly pulling your hair out from your scalp. I used to also constantly pull/scratch the skin out from my outer ear! Before I stopped picking, I have developed 6 ""devastated battlefields"" on my head and both outer ears where nothing but constant bleeding is noticed. I started lamotrigine for quite a while. It first did little to my trich. In the meantime, I was also on several different SSRI and one SNRI. HOWEVER, after I upped my dose to 125 mg (qd), the scratching IMMEDIATELY went away the day right after I upped my dosage!!! My anxiety  is now lower for the first time in years!",9

For a while seroquel worked for me somewhat; although it blunted my mood to the point I could hardly recognise myself it stopped the most awful suicidal symptoms. The side effects were harsh though - excessive somnolence and drastic weight gain (I went up to seventeen stone.) 

Eventually, the side effects outweighed the benefits, and I stopped taking it, with catastrophic consequences. I bounced around between medications for a while, before my doctor tried lamotrigine; it made a difference.

Since being on lamotrigine I have lost weight, started exercising, completed an access course, and am now working as a nursing assistant. I have been asymptomatic for 2 years, and have my life back.",9

The Lamictal was added and helped to calm my OCD but when the Seroquel was added it was awesome; I felt normal. If the Lamictal is helping but you still don't feel right, your doctor may increase the dose. Talk to him/her often and don't minimize a symptom because you think it is too small to mention. Some symptoms overlap and may be masking an untreated problem. Summary: Lamictal works. No side effects. I'm grateful for it every day.",10

My memory is very bad and my balance is a little off. For as much as the memory thing bothers me I'd rather have that than the alternative which is crazy. I hadn't tried ""everything"" before I tried lamictal but I tried enough meds to know how they did not work like lamictal did. It didn't happen over night. I had to ramp up very slowly not just because of the physical but to see how my mind was. It took about a year to get to my therapeutic dose and it was worth it. Talk to your Dr about everything it does to you. Work together",10
Kyle BC,"July 25, 2016",For Depression:,"I've tried roughly a dozen different medications for depression with little to no effect. Some have actually made me feel much worse. Lamotrigine's effect is relatively minor, but more significant than any other medication I've tried. It makes me feel more talkative and enables me to actually enjoy things. My mood still fluctuates quite a bit and on a bad day it has little effect, but the improvement it adds to my good days is very noticeable verse without it. It also helps my social anxiety.

Important to note though that it's next to useless for me when used alone. It's improvements only apply when taken with a serotonergic medication. (I take it venlafaxine and mirtazapine).",8
,,For Cyclothymic Disorder:,"Started taking it five years ago, and knew within a month that I had finally found a mood stabilizer that did the job.  No weight gain (if anything I lost weight), no lack of focus, and no restlessness.  This drug made me feel normal and at my baseline.  I recently added a small dose of Effexor (venlafaxine) and it's made me feel like a whole new person.

The one and only drawback is that I had to be careful about alcohol and caffeine consumption for a while.  I'm still a bit more sensitive to both, but that's a small price to pay for the benefits.",9

Because of headache, I have had to increase the dose of Lamictal extremely slowly (5mg to start, increasing by 5mg every 2-3 weeks as headaches abate), but it has made me more comfortable doing socially challenging things I want to do.

I had tried Lamictal early on after I received my diagnosis, but I was a typical teenager refusing to admit I had a problem. Tried multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants (made me extremely manic), and Lamictal has been the only one that has consistently worked. It doesn't cure all, but it does space out my episodes of mania, which are my most common, and depression, and lessens the severity and length.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I’m 27 & have been on Lamictal for about nine months now. It is literally the THE BEST BIPOLAR MEDICATION I have come across. Right before going on Lamictal I was on the Abilify injection and although it kept me stable, it gave me a horrible side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia which for me showed up as uncontrollable mouth movements. I work as a hostess at a restaurant and customers will make comments such as Are you tired? You are yawning! Or Are you chewing gum? and it significantly affected my self-esteem. My doctor recommended Lamictal after telling him my concern with the Tardive Dyskinesia. He first kept me on the Abilify and started on low dosages of Lamictal so that I can slowly ease into the new drug. If I remember correctly, he started me on 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 100mg then finally 200mg which is what I am on now. I believe I have been on 200mg since about February of 2019.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"A little over 3 or 4 months ago I wrote a review on this drug which I take for borderline personality disorder. I gave it a 10/10 however some things have changed my opinion on lamictal. First off, I think this is actually a great drug for mood stabilizing. I can’t remember the last time I lashed out or had a breakdown since I started taking this drug. I would say it works much better than antidepressants for me. However, I started breaking out with acne everywhere. Given that I’ve had very clear skin, this was a big problem for me. I think this can be easily treated so that’s why I am not rating it lower. Another thing is that taking oral birth control with this drug is pointless since it reduces the birth control effectiveness. On the flip side, I have no experience of weight gain. Actually I’ve lost about 8 lbs since I’ve been on this drug. I’m not sure if that’s the drug or if it’s that I’ve changed my lifestyle (which is probably what it is) but the main thing is that the drug has not caused weight gain.",8

oceanblue,"November 14, 2019",For Bipolar Disorder:,"I took lamotrigine for bipolar consistently for nearly two years and recently restarted it after accidentally taking a hiatus for 1.5 years (not advised, had a relapse). While the side effects were present at first (dizziness, drowsiness, headaches), they tended to go away within the first few weeks. Some people say meds make them feel groggy or not like themselves, but lamotrigine really levelled me out while allowing me to maintain my sense of self. I still dealt with occasional depressive periods, but the symptoms were much more mild and manageable than before. It was a game-changer in treating my bipolar disorder and made me feel alive again, which is why I was eager to restart it. I currently take 200mg and experience no symptoms.
My best advice when trying this medication is to give it time, both to wait out the side effects and to allow it to fully kick in. Be patient, it's worth it!!",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I haven't had any depressed episodes since I've started taking lamotrigine for bipolar.
I love this medication.
I don't know whether this med causes my brain to be slow and foggy, making it hard coming up with words.
But I still love this medication. It works wonders. 
As far as other reviews and ratings, you could already know that this is the drug for bipolar depression (not mania).
Highly recommend this.",10
,,For Depression:,"This medication saved my life. I had Severe MDD with suicidal ideation and I had tried almost every other class of antidepressant, and was giving up hope. SSRIs in particular did not work for me and caused adverse reactions. I also have panic disorder and GAD. I was having suicidal ideation constantly out of my own volition and those scary thoughts would never leave. I was so desperate and miserable that I lost 23 pounds in two months. I was so close to giving up hope. I started this medication and was quickly titrated up to 150 mg daily in addition to Wellbutrin and xanax as needed for panic. This medication has been an absolute miracle. It has completely gotten rid of the suicidal thoughts and the physical pain of the depression. It has also helped with my anxiety. I can feel happiness, and in some ways this is still shocking to me. I did not realize how incapable I was of that emotion until I was able to feel it after almost 10 years of struggling. It has absolutely saved my life, and I have minimal side effects.",10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,My experience with lamictal is different for me in most cases. I used to take 25mg of lamictal. When I had taken the meds everyday I didn't feel any different from when I wasn't taking them. I had no side effects it was like taking air. So I kept having suicidal thoughts & being angry at 8am & by 8:30 am i was happy. I just had different moods every 30 mins. So i talked to my doctor and told her the meds werent working i told her how i was feeling so she gave me 100mg. Ever since then i have had no feeling what so ever. Like I can choose what to care about & what not to care about. I'll be fine all day and by 8-9 o'clock pm all of my bipolar & depression hits me like a wave of sadness that I feel like I'm drowning in. I guess its worth it..,7
Jessiee,"December 14, 2015",For Anxiety:,"I started taking Lamictal after going to a PHP program. This medication worked really well for me but I was only on it for 2 months because I developed a rash and acne. It made my obsessive and thoughts occur less. I was able to handle situations with more logic and less emotional outbursts. I mean it truly was a great medication. However, my skin has always been clear but it was making me breakout more than I ever have in my life. I also felt like my hair was growing out thinner. If my emotions were totally out of control and life threatening than yes, I would have stayed on it despit the skin and hair problems. However for me it wasn't worth it. I would recommend at least trying it out.",7

I take it only in the morning at a low dosage - it's a bit of an upper and helps my brain work better and faster.  Probably no good for bipolars on the high energy side.  It's therapeutic, too - unlike lithium it's there working all the time.  Wouldn't take it at night, and something to wind down from it is helpful.  No side effects besides lunchtime headaches, a little extra clumsiness and mixing up words sometimes when I'm speaking or typing.",10
,,For Seizure Prevention:,"Lamotrigine changed my life! I had undiagnosed partial seizures in my sleep, as well as absence seizures during the day. At 22 y/o I began trying several medications (Topamax, Keppra, etc.) and had terrible side effects (weird dreams, sleepiness, aggression).
I am on 500mg of Lamotrigine daily. I do have mild forgetfulness and slight trouble with words on occasion. It doesn't bother me and it is worth it. I no longer have seizures and my mood has improved. It took a few weeks for my body to get used to. I would be wide awake and never get tired. But after a little while my sleep returned to normal.
Bottom line, I can't imagine my life without Lamotrigine. I recommend it above all other seizure medications.",10

I have had this same regimen for a year and a half. Before this I was about to give up all hope on medicines. Please keep in mind  no medicine will never fix your Bipolar Disorder. As far as side effects I have had significant hair loss. I think that started with other medicines though. I have also had EXTREMELY intense dreams. That's something I'm still getting use to.",9

My anxiety has gone (I have generalized anxiety disorder) and aside from a few initial side effects (mild acne/nightmares/mild stomach ache) which I have got through and now 6 weeks later I have had a major shift from suicidal depression to a completely normal mood. 

What I like about Lamotrigine is that I haven't gained any weight and is apparently weight friendly

I did get a craving for sour/sugary sweets which I wouldn't normally eat- this has gone away now but was an interesting side effect

I hate being on meds but to be honest if it keeps me feeling like this I'm happy to stay on it for as long as I need to.",10

Almost instantly, from that initial does of 25mg I started being able to focus and the fogginess lifted. As the dosage increased to 150mg to twice a day, I was given back all waking hours of clarity. I could focus, produce, study, think clearly, remember clearly, everything. As a result of being given power back, the depression vanished.",10

It's a horrible feeling once I've discovered what it was like to not have constant mood changes... Lamictal is a wonderful mood stabilizer!",9
Cat,"July 5, 2019",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I became manic over the course of a couple of months of just 100 mg of this medication. I was on the verge of psychosis and started to have hallucinations. I did have a lot of stress in my life, but after 8 days of being totally off of it, I am feeling more sane and like I can function again without total confusion.  Scariest thing I've been through with my mental health yet. It felt like an acid trip combined with mania. I read a medical journal report online that it is possible to have a hypomanic switch on a low dose.  I think anything that works somehow directly on serotonin is not for me anymore. 
**I took this drug at 400 mg. Many years ago and it did nothing to lift my depression and now this. Wonder if it interacted badly with a low dose of Ativan that I was taking for acute stress disorder over time. Still, feel better off of it. I still may try 25 mg. just for depression if I start falling into one again. Other bad side effects physically as well.",1

It worked very well for controlling moodswings, particularly the rage filled depressive mixed episodes but caused absolutely massive memory and congition problems about 8 months into treatment at 200mg a day. It was odd, the world just kind slipped into the present. I couldn't even do things like cook toast because I would forget what I was doing. I have since cut the dose to 25mg a day. It works far less well for the moodswings but doesn't mess up my mind much now. All in all, mixed results. I still take it. It beats the alternatives which were awful.",6

My most recent depressive episode had lasted 9 months & my levels of anger, aggression, irrational thoughts & behaviour and feelings of utter despair were very frightening. 
I began taking lamotrogine at 12.5mg dose and slowly titrated up over 10 weeks to 100mg. Even at the 50mg dose my mood was not lifting so reluctantly my psychiatrist introduced venlafaxine which I now take at 150mg. The lamotrogine has stopped my racing thoughts, incessant & excitable talking, my irritability & aggressive outbursts. I have the calm peace of mind & control of my emotions I never thought I would.",9
,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"(I have PTSD from multiple sexual assaults) I had been taking Lexapro and bupropion for depression/anxiety for the past 7-8 years. My new psychiatrist suggested stopping these and being put on lamotrigine to help with my depressive cycles and panic attacks and just to stabilize my mood and trauma responses. I went up gradually, from 25mg to 50mg to 100mg, and just started 150mg. I had a panic attack and self-harm incident after starting this medication, but overall I am not as triggered by things and my response time to hard situations has gone down to 6 mins to an hour or two compared to taking me out for days at a time. I was really reluctant at first since this was a mood stabilizer, but it's the only thing that's worked for my PTSD.",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I had taken many antidepressants and they never worked.

Of course I still have lows being bipolar but it is no where near what I had experienced prior to lamictal. My depression and bipolar is manageable with lamictal alone except when I get hypo manic and even then it's manageable without additional meds. It saved my life and I will take it forever.",10

I started off taking just 25 mg then after 2weeks 50 then after I finished that 100 then after that 200. When I first started taking the small doses . I didn't see any changes in my behavior and that made me very hopeless and angry and I feel like nothing could help me. But once she uped my dose  I feel like a human again.

,,For Epilepsy:,"I have been taking lamotrigine (generic drug, which brand depends on what my pharmacy has) for just over 6 years. For the first few years I did still have a handful of tonic clonic (grand mal) seizures, but over time my dosage has been increased and I have learned what my major triggers are. Combining these two means that my seizures are well under control - I have been seizure-free for about 2 and a half years now, and am able to drive again. I am on a high dose (200mg morning, 300mg evening) but I don't notice any major side effects. Occasionally I have tremors in my hands in the morning, but only if I have had very disturbed sleep. In the UK lamotrigine is a ""first line"" drug, in that it is the best choice and most well tolerated of any other anti-epileptic drug. If you are new to an epilepsy diagnosis then I would recommend discussing lamotrigine with your doctor or neurologist before trying any other drug.",8

Everything is a bit dulled which helps with my food/drug addictions. Nothing tastes or feels as good, but they still feel good! Just not overwhelming good, which works out great for me.

Having suffered from depression and rapid mood swings (hypo mania) for more than 37 years it is a relief and very validating to hear other people's experiences if even if all of them are not applicable to mine .  I experienced a severe depression with a suicide attempt 36 years ago. Since then a variety of medications have treated my depression quite well. I also found a loving husband and have a job I really like. Those external things can make a big difference too.

She had to go to a recovery house to keep her safe. It states that this drug can cause suicide ideation in the under 25s.

Star_Lover,"October 11, 2010",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on Lamictal for almost two years now, along with Lithium. I like Lamictal a lot. I have to get off Lithium because it's raising my blood pressure and causing weight gain. Lamictal doesn't cause any side effects that are dangerous, I think I have memory problems and concentration issues but nothing too bad. I'm a full time second year college student with a 3.8 GPA so if anything this medicine is helping me do well in school. For anyone who had a bad reaction I feel bad for you because when this drug works it's doing the business. For sure, good luck new users. Try never to increase your dosage too high; remember the higher it is the harder to get off. ",10
,,For Anxiety:,"This is my first drug prescribed for my mental health. I took 100mg for 6 months, sadly it did not help at all.

I've never written anything like this,  but for the past year I've been on 400mg of Lamictal with 2400mg of gabapentin.  I also take 100mg of amitriptyline every other night.  Lamictal is the only reason I'm still around.  It is the only thing has helped my depression.  Yes,  it took about a month,  and I've started and stopped which made it worse.  But being on it nonstop has really given me my life back.  I know it's different for everybody.  I've had zero side-effects other than an occasional dry mouth.  I never thought I'd praise a pill,  but I felt so strongly about it,  I thought I needed to put it here.  I'm a 37yo male.",10
Cassidy Shane,"August 8, 2017",For Depression:,"After falling ill with major depression this past Spring, my doctor prescribed Lamectil.  I noticed a positive change at 50 mg , and am now up to 75 mgs.  I'm looking forward to titration up to 100 and hope that will be the most effective dose, as with fibromyalgia, I am very sensitive to meds. This med has also changed my life as I became non functional, prior to taking it.  I pray the positive effects last, as I was in a very dark place without it.  I take my dose in the morning, as I was having difficulty sleeping at night ( and take melatonin and benzos) for that. My appetite has also not yet gotten back to normal, but I am taking in enough calories to maintain the weight I lost during the depression.",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started taking it last year for bipolar II but I can honestly say it has been amazing for me. Initially, I had symptoms of cold, which is listed as a common side effect, but other than that no other significant side effects. It lifted me out of severe depression, and now I have consistent moods and am able to handle life in a way I never thought I'd be able to. Reading through the other reviews it seems that for a few individuals the medication doesn't suit them, but for most, it is incredibly effective. I would highly recommend trying it, especially as if it doesn't suit you all the side effects are reversible as soon as you stop taking it, and it has no addictive qualities whatsoever, nor does it make you feel out of it like an antipsychotic would. Try this medication because for me it has changed my life and I think it could benefit others.",10

I’ve been taking Lamictal now for one year (the only medication I’m on) and the results have been wonderful; I’m much more stable in my relationships and my depressive episodes  have decreased significantly, and even when they do come up, I’m able to pull myself out from it instead of ruminate and spiral like I used to.

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Lamotrigine 2 months now for Bipolar 2.  I was not on anything for the past 5 years. I started off really slow because I’m sensitive.  I have to say within the first week my anxiety was minimal. Now 2 months later I’m at 150 mg.  I feel less irritable , happier, not depressed, no anxiety.  I never realized  how much anxiety I had until I didn’t . I didn’t even realize that would help cure that.  Only side effects we minor headaches when I upped dosage and it was not bad and only 1 day.  I still struggle with falling asleep but that was before this medication (but sleep is improving) I have a clearer head with work too.  I would definitely recommend trying it.  I hate the idea I need a drug for the rest of my life.  But it’s the only drug with minimal side effects I think I will.  I follow up with my Dr tomorrow the medicated dosage is 200 mg.

This evened out on the 3rd day and I began to feel very motivated and able to think clearly. I still experienced a few depressive episodes, but I hope to get onto an antidepressant once my dose is high enough. I've began taking 25mg in the AM to slowly move up to 100 in the AM on top of my 100 at night. Since I have, my memory, attention, and anxiety have worsened and other side effects have been sweating, raised heart rate, some trouble sleeping, and slight photo-sensitivity.

But with the Zoloft and Prozac I would go into extreme manic states and clean my floors for 6 hours, spend all my money on crap, cry uncontrollably or even get violent. I was like that already just worse on those medicines. Finally seeing another doctor trying to find help he put my on Lamictal. Small dose at first and now I'm on 400mg/day.

As I write this I recall that before starting Lamictal I had excruciating pain in my solar plexus. I was in a deep state of bipolar depression with spikes of rage and extreme anxiety at least 2 times each month. Lamictal has made these mixed state less severe and not as frequent. I also take Paxil CR.  As for side effects, at first I had headaches and nausea but I endured them gladly.  ",10

However after two weeks of 25 mg I increased to 50 mg and after 6 days of 50mg I was admitted in the hospital with aseptic meningitis.  I didn't know at time it was from medication.  I came home restarted medication and then started with rash so stopped medication.  When I called my psych to tell him about rash and about recent hospital stay he told me Lamcital causes meningitis.  I was told to stop medication immediately.,1

I have severe muscle spasms in the neck. I think it has helped me in some ways but not others, it made my already severe insomnia worse, so now I have sleeping pills (which still don't work sometimes). It has sort of improved my mood some people say I'm less erratic. I am not sure though. I'm giving it a 5 because the neck pain is bad, and the increased paranoia is bad and I don't really think it has helped with disassociation too much. ",5

She said to go to a behavioral specialist anyway to see what they says.  The Specialist diagnosed me with Cyclothemia, which seems to be bipolar light, or rather just moody.  Certainly the latter is true.  I'm not a fan of meds but this has really changed me, for the better I believe.  If I forget to take it, boy can I tell.  Not sure if it's withdrawals or how I used to feel.  If I lose my insurance I can keep taking it.  It's cheap thank goodness.",8

Now 2.5 months in and 200mg and I'm 95% better. I have had 2 extreme mood swings in almost 3 months which is unbelievably good.

This drug has not helped at all with depression, but I take 120 mg of latuda as well as 500 mg of lamictal and 300 mg 3x a day gabapentin.

I'm 5 days in and hope it goes away soon. Googling the rashes scared me of course, but all the rashes I saw were oozing and wet and widespread. Mine are very dry little patches, maybe only a handful of them in total here and there. Really scary, I'll have to keep an eye on them. More googling told me SJS starts on the chest in the front, and mine started on my hips, so maybe thats good. I realize theres a lot of areas a worrying rash can start. I'll just keep watching it.

I felt I was about to jump out of my skin.  Because of this level of anxiety, I even made unwise decisions that I link to lamotrigine -- ended up having to sell my car, move to a place I couldn't afford, and in a real financial bind.

I have previously tried Pristiq, Lexapro, Prozac (do NOT take Prozac if you are BPD and have anger symptoms as it makes it 100 times worse), Tegretol, Valium, Sodium Valporate, Queitapine and probably others but i think thats it. Tegrotol was the best thing that worked for me but i got the itchy blood side effect after 3 months on it. So i am trying this other mood stabiliser Lamitrigine from my own research.

I have insomnia so I also take Ambien CR and Xanax. It's not a healthy combination but it all works for the most part.

Icicleman,"October 18, 2015",For Bipolar Disorder:,"After Depakote, Celexa and Nuerontin, which all helped to some degree but made me feel sick and medicated, my Doc prescribed Lamictal. Within weeks I felt normal, I could laugh, cry and get excited (not in a manic state) about situations. My family who have suffered through those years, were finally able to let go and be themselves with me, not walking on eggshells. It sure has saved my marriage and family relationships.",9
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"I started lamotrigine as per my psychiatrist to stabilize my anger and agitation from BPD. I tapered up slowly and had no issues with a rash. The more I took it and the higher the dose went I noticed it was helping more and more with my anger and agitation but not with depression or suicidal thoughts. I was crying daily after months on it and could not feel any happiness or positive emotions although it was helping with outbursts for sure. 
That's when the physical side effects began. I developed severe painful cystic acne whereas before I had fairly clear skin. This was some deep painful acne that was so painful I could not touch my own face and have to now be on antibiotics for months which is another story. I now have nerve damage at 24",2
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"A psychiatrist prescribed Lamictal off-label for my depression. I felt the effects within 30 minutes of taking the first pill.

I take pleasure in things I had almost forgotten about. My emotions are coming back, I'm not 'numb' anymore. Let's hope it lasts. Only side effect : a rash on days 1 and 2 which went away on its own. I also feel just a little bit lazy, which is a welcome change in my case. No weird side effects like those of antidepressants. I had prayed God to guide the doctor towards the right molecule and He did.",10

Wish I had discovered the need for a slightly higher dose sooner. In addition to lamictal I take 150mg of Wellbutrin daily with an occasional break to prevent a hypocrite manic episode. Also take Seroquel for sleep for some other bipolar symptoms. Lastly, Klonopin for general / social anxiety.

My hormones were all out of whack, causing my periods to be irregular and horrific.

The biggest benefits of this medicine is that it stabilizes my mood without feeling weird (fake, plastic, hyper) with very few side effects.  The sexual side effects and weight gain I experienced on Prozac, and the restlessness and irritability of Celexa and Welbutrin, just don't occur for me on this medicine.  
The drawback for me has been a narrowing of my emotional bandwidth.  I rarely feel spontaneous excitement or joy.  This may be partly because of life circumstances, but I'm certain that this medicine is also playing a role here. High anxiety, may not be related to this medicine.",8

I believe everyone should get to a therapeutic level and wait at least two months before they give up unless you get the rash or really depressed or anything else that can be life threatening. All These medicines takes time to work. You won’t feel it working in a week or sooner that’s just the placebo effect if you feel it working.

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I started taking lamictal at age 18 years old for bipolar and  I’m still on it at age 21. Lamictal reduces the frequency and intensity of manic and depressive episodes. I’ve experienced less side effects on lamictal than any other mood stabilizer- antipsychotic Ive taken. The risk for harmful rash STS is present but rare (I think it’s 3 in 1000 people). This risk is reduced by ramping up slowly. It took time to achieve a therapeutic dose. Lamictal is less effective when combined with hormonal birth control, so I take a higher dose.  I’ve experienced depressive and hypomanic episodes on lamictal, but they were efficiently managed by increasing the dose or adding an antidepressant. (I take Wellbutrin and buspar for my total  drug cocktail). I recommend this medication because it works without harmful side effects (like weight gain and brain fog).",10

I am a very patient loving person and even I was at my wit's end after trying to end this relationship and getting sucked back in several times only to be treated worse each time.  I knew he (admittedly, even) had some issues, don't we all?, and I think he wanted to stay in the more socially acceptable area of depression/anxiety and yes even drug use/abuse, so he never mentioned BPD and it was one of the diagnosis I wasn't really up to pace with until tonight..

So I have taken this medication now for about 3 weeks to help me sleep!, the odd thing is, is I have woken up at odd times of the night not being able to fall back asleep!, which triggers my depression later on in the day if I do not get enough sleep, I found out I had Anxiey and Depression while I was on my mission for the church of jesus Christ of latter day saints, I have felt better since being on medication, but I am still waking up at odd times in the night!",4

Boppo93,"March 25, 2021",For Depression:,"Before lamictal, I had given up on psych meds and was extremely depressed, hopeless, and suicidal. I was also stuck in a relationship but I didn't believe I could survive a single day on my own. On lamictal, I started to feel better within 2 weeks. I felt calmer, happier, more at ease, and I could enjoy myself again. No pill is magic so I still struggled with depression, but it was much easier to manage and it gave me a sense of strength and confidence, which allowed me to make much needed changes in my life such as ending my relationship and moving out on my own. The only issues I had were that it made my acne worse (sounds weird but it's true) and I started experiencing some memory and concentration problems at 200 mg. Unfortunately, my personal experience with psych meds is that they stop working as well eventually, so after a couple years I had to switch. Still, I'm thankful for what lamictal did for me and I think it's a good, very tolerable drug.",7

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been fighting mood swings and depression for years and have tried all the antidepressants which for the most part didn't work and sometimes made me worse and more crazy, so I went to clinic and was lucky enough to tell this to a random doctor, she said it common for doctors to prescribe antidepressants for bipolar by mistake, I took a questionnaire that basically suggested I was Bipolar. I saw my regular doctor after this and he agreed and put me on Lamotigrine and it was like the lights went on, I am three days in and so amazed how I feel with no noticeable side effects I am stable and not constantly self talking and feel bad weak and discouraged , it works for what it was made for, keep looking and get diagnosed for the right thing because you can spend years taking the wrong medicine.

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I take lamotrigine 200mg x2 a day for bipolar 2 and so far it’s been great. I’ve noticed that I have better impulse control, my mood isn’t flat at all but I have control for the most part about my spending habits and impulsivity. This combined with wellbutrin 450mg pulled me out of a deep depression that I was stuck in for months just staring at walls and crying when I had to do the most basic of things. I’d highly suggest this before getting into hardcore mood stabilizers. There’s nothing wrong with stepping stones if they work with your brain chemistry just because they’re off label.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 and was put on 25mg of Lamotrigine and titrated up to currently 125mg. I can say this medication is a life saver.

It is a process to titrate but the outcome for me was worth it.,10

Cyrus,"October 1, 2021",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This medication has been a godsent. I was hesitant for a long time because my genesight test results weren’t compatible with the medication; nonetheless I gave it a try. I’ve been on Depakote before and that seemed to help, but would ‘dull’ me out, and I guess it’s hard on the liver. I’ve been on Lamictal for a month now and have slowly titrated up (25mg, 50mg, 75mg). My psychiatrist has me taking two a day, one in the morning and one at night before bed. I wake up feeling levelheaded and am able to think clearer than I’ve ever had before. It works well with OCD too. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and Borderline Personality Disorder—so I’m definitely a hot mess. Aside from Lamictal, I take Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Mirtazapine—like I said I’m a hot mess. The only negative to this drug is rare life threatening rash; that comes from being inconsistent and changing doses too fast.",10
,,For Anxiety:,I had tried almost every other medication without success. The one that worked for me (phenalzine) has been discontinued. I was on Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine.

,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Seizure Prevention:,I had a series of severe episodes in '14 and that's when I began this drug. Initially it made me really drowsy but it was manageable. Otherwise I've had absolutely no problems! Only downside is that its levels can be easily affected/lowered with other drugs. In order to take birth control pills I had to nearly double my lamictal dosage as the estrogen made my lamictal levels plummet.,9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Only been taking this medication lamotrigine  for about 3 weeks, before I was having a really hard time with discontinuation syndrome from stopping my sertraline medication which wasn't working). Things escalated quite quickly to the point I couldn't cope at all and was FINALLY referred to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Bipolar 2. Since taking lamotrigine I’ve gone from crying every day to not at all, my mood is so much more stable and I’ve been able to clean the house again (I’m OCD so not being able to clean was driving me nuts) I still flip between moods very quickly and struggle with controlling my anger but I’ve been doing so much better! Honestly would recommend giving it a go if you’re struggling! Good luck :)",6
Pepileptic,"August 28, 2015",For Seizure Prevention:,"While the cognitive side effects weren't too bad, I had to go off this medication because it made me develop a condition known as persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), along with noticeable facial flushing.  Initially, it gave me some pep in my step, and seemed like a pleasant surprise, but after a few months, the side effects intensified to the point that I couldn't look at a man without my face turning bright red, along with intense and painful arousal that wouldn't subside.  These side effects went away when I discontinued lamotrigine, and I'm only insanely aroused during ovulation - like most adult women.  lol.  I just wanted to share my experience because PGAD isn't really discussed as a side effect.",4
Audrey K,"January 9, 2017",Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Not the most effective. It did tone down my hypomania a little bit. I normally get depressive episodes at a set time every year, and lamotrigine pushed it a bit later than it would have been. Besides that, it didn't do much; I'm still having severe depressive episodes that lead to suicidality. No side effects on its own, but I've noticed that it seems to magnify the side effects of other drugs if I take both (e.g., if I take a drug that makes me drowsy, lamotrigine makes me more drowsy; if I take a drug that makes me nauseous, lamotrigine makes me more nauseous, etc.). All in all I'm pretty neutral on this drug. It's not great, but not bad.",5
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I started this medication after switching from quetiapine for Bipolar 2.  I have so much more energy on this medication, I have lost weight and it has levelled out my mood considerably (my usual mood state is low, but I do cycle a couple of times a year).  During initial titration I had trouble sleeping, dry mouth and digestive bleeding.  But these have lessened over time and I use laxatives and synthetic saliva to ease the side effects.  Overall I'm very happy with this medication.",9

Amy jean,"June 26, 2019",For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on Lamotrigine for over a year now for bipolar and am currently taking 100 mgs. Although it has seemed to somewhat level me out in a sense, I kind of feel flat and lifeless. It suppresses my appetite quite a bit as well. Even if my stomach is rumbling, food sounds kinda gross, and when I do eat it, it's not as enjoyable. Keeps my weight down. Hair isn't as thick anymore. But for the love of all things  good do NOT forget to take your daily dose. I forgot one day and all the sudden when I was driving, I felt dead. I don't know how to describe it, but I felt like I wasn't existing in my body. Heart started beating faster, severe anxiety, couldn't function in society. Helpful tip: if you wear glasses, place your weekly med pack tipped up on top of your glasses when you take them off at night, on your nightstand with a glass of water. That way you won't forget to take them in the morning when you put your glasses back on. Or of course set an alarm on your phone. Best of luck!",5

I've previously been on antipsychotic medication, which I cannot emphasize enough on how negative my experience with this class of medicines has been. Abilify made my anxiety worse. Seroquel made me gain 20 pounds in 2 weeks. Geodon was cost prohibitive and amplified my anxiety. The only side effect I have complaints about is fairly severe dry mouth. I'd recommend a mouthwash that is for people with dry mouth if you opt to take this medicine. Otherwise, I have noticed nearly instant improvement in my symptoms with this.",8

I am now diagnosed by a psychiatrist rather than the Drs who kept telling me it was only anxiety with Complex Post Traumatic Disorder. I have now been taking the lamotrigine for just over a year. I am stable for the first time in my life, I cannot express what this means to me at 52 years when all my life I have been governed by my mental health, I used to keep going back to the Drs - hundreds of times since the age of 19 years. I keep thinking if I had one Dr who followed all of my complaints correctly my life would have been worth living and I wouldn't have lost so many jobs and friends. I give Lamotrigine 100%, at least I have the next 20 years to enjoy although not in a youthful state - years I will never get back.",10

No side effects whatsoever no problems when I forget to take one of the 100mg doses of lamotrigine during the day, except a little fatigue. When I forget my 750mg of seroquel before bedtime, I don't fall asleep, so I get up to take them. When I forget them entirely I have a cold turkey all of the next day. Shivers, diarhhea, fatigue etc.

I take 400mg/daily and if I miss a dose by1 hr I get a horrible headache. Meanwhile for the past yr I feel as if I need to bump up the doses.  My psychiatrist said that 400mg is a very high dose and she's not comfortable exceeding. I take the dissolving tablets, which I found is a slow release and I'm able to get thru my day more easily.  Also, because this is a brand name, is very hard to find it in stock! 
I definitely would recommend this drug, after trying numerous, this was the one that controlled my mood swings without side effects.",9

Also, I've noticed that if I miss even one dose (I take 150 mg twice a day) I start to get really agitated and irritable, so I'm afraid that it's permanently altered my biochemistry - guess I'm stuck with it.

I can honestly say that I feel like my old self and I haven’t felt like this in over six months. It’s great at preventing episodes and when they do occur they’re very mild. Only thing is I wake up earlier but I’m fine with that. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.,9

It also keeps depression at bay, I am off antidepressants and haven’t had another depressive episode. On top of that I haven’t had a panic attack in years too.

I was becoming severely anxious and depressed, and still trying to hold my job on 2 hours of sleep. Eventually I began to break down. I got another psych opinion, and the suggestion was Lamictal. I escalated gradually, starting with peds doses, all the way to 200 mg. I was using 15 mg of Ambien to sleep in the beginning. That dropped to 10mg pretty quickly, then 7.5mg, 5mg, and then 2.5mg in divided doses through the night. By 8 weeks I had my first drug free night of sleep in 8 months.

FrankieCasual,"April 19, 2017",For Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamotrigine is, hands down, the best bipolar medication I have used! It is highly effective for depressive episodes and has no side effects, for me. It also does not cause weight gain! I am rating 10 out of 10 for bipolar depression. I have combined it with an antipsychotic for mania; a highly effective combination for me.

If you are struggling with bipolar depression, I highly recommend you speak with your doctor about giving lamotrigine a try. The risk of rash is low if you follow your doctor's instructions.",10

But, I am very forgetful of little details, which is irritating at work because of course it affects my project output.  It was fine with the lower dose so I'll ride it out and see how I adjust.

I don't rage at stupid telemarketers, but neither do I find any interest in anything I used to enjoy... no TV, no reading, no online games...

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on Lamictal for only a month but I've seen dramatic improvements. I abused marijuana and that's when my mood swings STARTED and became out of control.

But there is something way different. After my mood swings now, I can actually recover from these moods. I feel I can truly work THROUGH a problem rather than just crying it out from exhaustion and waiting for a second wind to get upset all over again. Prior, mood swings would last hours and recovery was nonexistent. Now, I will have a mood swing, and after ward I will usually cry it out, and most importantly make amends with my boyfriend who I always hurt in the process of these angry moods.

He had me start on 25mg am and 25mg pm and taper up. I moved and got a new neurologist. She upped my dosage, again and again. I was having 0 symptoms, 0 problems, no seizures, but she said that my blood level was required to be at a certain percentage to ensure its effectiveness, even though it was already effective. I'm on 300mg am and 300 mg pm now and I absolutely hate this medication. If I don't take it at the same time everyday, I experience extreme mood swings. It has affected many of my relationships.

Constipation is another, my doctor says its just my body rejecting the medication. Memory, impossible remembering things, everything I do has to be written down, including when I finish work. Remembering people, names, faces etc - I've lost 'friends' because I can't remember names & they think I'm being 'funny' with them. The nurse said I will be on the meds for 2 to 3 years, I could do with coming off it sooner but I am so scared because I am afraid I will have another episode.

I would bruise just by a bracelet resting on my arm for a few minutes and then the bruise wouldn't go away, the worst side effect was terrible circulation.

I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It's a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.",10

After a while that went away to.  I went to get my blood work done and requested it myself because the doctor said it wasn't necessary on lamotrigine it revealed mild grade neutropenia and I was told to keep taking this medication. After a while I started to feel more unwell and another blood test was done two weeks later which revealed worsening neutropenia.

I can't say it helps greatly, though.  I estimate it takes me from a 3 to a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 for mood (it somewhat decreases anger and hopelessness).",7

I’ve been in a severe depressive episode for about a year now. I’m not sure how much Lamotrigine has done this depressive episode, because I was taking two additional psychiatric medications. I think it has helped a little though. I’m now feeling much better because I started a fourth medication Lithium. For me I have no side effects with Lamotrigine which is nice.

If I'll be in a bad mood or a good mood. I'm just .... stable. For the first time in my life. My muscle pain melted away, I can stand up straight, I've maybe had one mild panic attack in 2 weeks (and that was because of external stress issues), only side effect was some diarrhea and insomnia which is going away.

It helped me control my irrational emotional reactions to things, temper, helped to bring my mood up from below while not causing hypomania, lost a little bit of weight on it. The only thing negative about it is when I first started it, it did make me quite anxious, but that attenuated over time. It also makes me tremor quite severely.",8
,,For Epilepsy:,"I hate lamotrigine.  My epilepsy has been controlled 100%  while taking Dilantin for 38 years.  My doctor highly recommended that I change Dilantin to Lamotrigine because Dilantin is a very old drug and has a long term side effect of memory loss.  I really did not want to make this change but he managed to convince me.  I made the change December 2018 and since then my life has turned upside down.  No coordination, memory loss, cannot remember things that happened minutes before, constantly forgetting where I placed things.  Worse of it all, I've been on the decline with making good decisions at work, speech, writing typing reading difficulties.  I truly felt that I  have early signs of Alzheimer of dementia.  I could not stand it.  I finally insisted to my doctor to go back to dilantin immediately.  I am now back on Dilation for 3 days and I am just praying to God I will get back to normal again.",1

My daughter has had some form of depression since high school. Where she has had therapy it wasn't recommended that she take medication. She has a safety plan in place, food, exercise etc. She seemed to manage the depression pretty well until college. She had never been on any antidepressants before and her first trip the the pshyc. they put her on lamictal 25 mg.  My fear as a mom is that she is depressed not bipolor.

I still have my seizures at least 5 times a day and because it really doesn't work it's hard to remember to take it sometimes but I almost always take it.

I ended up getting migraines daily and it sky rocketed my bipolar to the point I couldn't get out of bed.

The only things I noticed was that I felt like an emotional zombie and felt NOTHING. I had no empathy, no joy, no happiness, no sadness…nothing, just dull and flat. It was AWFUL. 

I couldn’t take it anymore and took myself off and I IMMEDIATELY lost 15 pounds without trying (and have not gained it back).  I noticed I’d gained it but didn’t attribute it to the meds…I was wrong. 

I also felt it didn’t help my angry outbursts whatsoever. I still got depressed as well. 

I REFUSE to take this medication anymore and I’ve been self-managing for years. Like another reviewer said: I’d rather feel a little psychotic than like a zombie.",1

MBD,"September 16, 2020",For Seizure Prevention:,"My pharmacy (and likely yours) changes the manufacturers of generics regularly to get the best price that year. It turns out that sometimes the best priced medications are not therapeutically the same. Unichem makes lamotrigine that maintains my drug levels and prevents my seizures. 

A seizure results in the temporary loss of driving privilege. Truly, you don’t want to seize while driving and hit someone. The restriction continues for six months. If you can’t imagine it, imagine being sixteen again and staying out too late one night with your parents car. They ground you for six months. It’s like that. 

Especially for seizure meds, insist on the same manufacturer every time you get your prescription filled.",10

I had orginally been titrated very quickly and it caused a mixed episode. The effectiveness was noticed gradually each month. I started to notice fewer and fewer bipolar symptoms and noticed more stability as I slowly went higher.

At 200mgs I am almost symptom free and take it as a monotherapy. My cognitive awareness has improved since taking lamotrigine as well as my spelling and dyslexia.",9

I often forget that I am sick.  Minor side effects, mostly stiff muscles in my neck and back, but totally worth it.  I was previously prescribed Seroquel, which made me emotionally numb and then Geodon which amplified my symptoms.   I assumed I was just getting worse but it was the medicine  that was producing the very symptoms it was supposed to cure.  Lamictal has given me back my life.   I am highly functional now but without the manias.   Even the full moon doesn't affect me anymore.  My only other drug is trazodone which helps me sleep and takes off the edge of any depressions.  As long as you follow the directions to avoid the rash, you will be so glad you switched to this drug.",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"My experience for the 8 months I've been on generic Lamotrigine has been less than stellar.

In the beginning, I had several very good moments, but my mood often ""flipped"" due to some small trigger, at which point it became ""dysphoric"" and spiraled into a state of depression and/or pattern of 'acting out'.

At every stage, I looked forward to the next increase, hoping I would soon ""experience the miracle"" I'd read about. 

Lamotrigine is known to more effectively treat Bipolar depression than mania, so I should have realized it might not be a good match.

I've had more spending sprees, intense emotions and two psychotic episodes (one while at the target dosage) as the dosage has increased.

I think that lower dosages--100 to 150--were better for me.

Prayers for all those suffering with BP.",5

I met my boyfriend, am holding down a job, getting A's in grad school…all things I could not do 1 year ago. Don’t give up. It can get better. I take 100mg twice per day.

If I scratch the itch at all the skin turns bright red and spreads along with itching.  The itching is horrible.  3 days after 50mg increase I have all the above side effects plus sweats, chills and flu like symptoms. Have extremely strange dreams and nightmares.  I didn't have these side effects when I first started the medicine. They started gradually and I think it is time to look for a different medicine.",8
,,For Epilepsy:,"When I started going to my new neurologist, she transitioned me over to lamotrigine for my Epilepsy because if I was to get pregnant, it causes the least amount of birth defects. Compared to Keppra and Topiramate, I had fewer side effects with Lamotrigine and specifically the Unichem manufacturers. Well, 4 years after I started taking Lamotrigine, I did get pregnant. Over the course of 9 months, I needed to adjust my medication from 500mg to 1,000mg; however, no seizures- thankfully. 

The one downside about the Unichem manufactures is a lot of pharmacies don’t carry it for Lamotrigine and need to put in a special order so sometimes you need to call multiple pharmacies to see how quick they can order it. I have found in the past couple months, that Walgreens specifically carries the Unichem brand.",9

I told my doctor next time I saw him I wanted off the medication. He then told me the meds were safe and tripled my dose. The next couple of months, I couldn't get out of bed in the morning without having seizure after seizure. Eventually it led to a grand-mal and only then would my neurologist see me about it. Unfortunately I found online that its a pretty common thing for others with JME to have this experience taking lamictal. My doctor didn't explain these risks to me, and if he had I would have exercised my right as a patient to refuse the treatment based on how the meds were making me feel and this never would have happened.

Although it only partially controls my mania/hypomania (I later started lithium as well), it relieved my depression like nothing else ever could.  I started at 25mg and titrated up to 150mg with each increase bringing greater and greater relief.  The best part: zero side effects.

Prayer also make a difference,"August 19, 2017",For Bipolar Disorder:,Hi everyone...I want to share my experience on this drug. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 in 2015. At first doctors thought it was depression or/and post traumatic syndrome bc I went bankrupt right before I got sick. The doc tried all anti-depressants you can ever imagine in a matter of 3 weeks. It was a true nightmare. Then they realized that my bad reactions to antidepressants was the main reason to diagnose me as a bipolar 2. Thank God I didn't have any rash otherwise I don't know what would have happened. Understanding how lamictal works is vital. However each person is different. The metabolism is what you have to keep an eye on. I have a very fast metabolism. That helped me go up in this medication very fast from 25mg up to 200mg.,10
CJH-J,"September 10, 2015",For Bipolar Disorder:,"Absolutely increased my energy and clarity.  Taking 200mg of Lamotrigine.  Enabling me to get off Serequel down to 25 mg every other night stopping completely by the end of this month.

A bit hyper manic/rapid cycle but under control - note I just started 2 months ago.",10

I am finally being treated by a good psych doc and he prescribed this great mood stabilizer for me. Now on 75 mgs once daily and I have been taking this for 7 weeks. I did have thinning hair; take multivitamin and Vitamin D and notice difference!  I feel better, don't get angry at work, moods more even and am able to think clearly.  I wake up at night with terrible sweats and don't know what that is about (will discuss with doc next week).  I walk a lot and exercise is excellent for the body and mind.

I was started on lamotrigine 25mg & was gradually increasing. 1 week into being on 50mg, I developed a rash in the back of the roof of my mouth and a very sore throat. After freaking out, I found out this could have been from Lamictal? I stopped the Lamictal and within 2 days my throat was totally cleared up, however still a bit sore. 
Thoroughout my time on Lamictal, I have felt increasingly worse. My body hurts and is tired, I feel flat and emotionless, and am in a weird and constant state of pain. I get exhausted just taking a shower. Lamictal has increased my anxiety- I have episodes where I can’t breathe, my heart is pounding, and I feel like it is the end (like a panic attack but more intense) These episodes happen frequently, almost every day. They are getting worse and more frequent.",2

,,For Epilepsy:,"This is the second drug I have taken for my epilepsy, after switching from Keppra for side effects. 

Lamotrigine has worked well for me, reducing my simple partial seizure activity down to a once or twice a month (from 2-3 times a day). The only side effect I have had is making me tired, specifically while increasing my dosage (something that must be done very slowly), though even while on a steady dosage for awhile I still felt it a bit. However, discussing this with my doctor, discovered this comes in an extended release form, and unless I'm increasing the dose, no longer have any issues of feeling tired from this. 

I am currently taking 450MG a day. Be forewarned, I recently had to change healthcare coverage, and my new insurance company will not cover the ER form, and wanted me to go back onto the multiple times a day form.

At first, while I was increasing the dosage it gave me extremely lucid dreams (like, wake up thinking that it was real kind of thing).
After you're on it for a while, it's pretty much just life.
Only bad I can think of is how irritable I get when I'm hungry and I feel crummy when my blood sugar is low.

Again I worried can SSRI  be restarted? Will I respond again? At times clonazepam helps to relieve anxiety not depression.  Then after going through literature I started lamotrigine 100 mg twice daily. I had intense rash on 3 rd day but mood was fully stabilised. I had vivid dreams too. I was thinking how to get rid of skin rash that covered my abdomen only. I have taken cetrizine after which it subsided. Lamotrigine is a good mood stabiliser and the doctor does not permits me to stop lamotrigine, but skin rash is problem but settled with antihistamines that I  am on.

draco,"September 7, 2019",For Bipolar Disorder:,"hey y'all! I've had bipolar since childhood. Always went unmedicated until my partner took his own life in front of me and quickly found my disorder overwhelming. I struggle primarily with ideation- but I also have some psychotic facets. Lamotrigine quietened my racing thoughts within the first month, delusions and hallucinations toned down, and the only suicidal ideation/downswing I've had since has been due to c-ptsd. I really cannot recommend this drug enough, it's been amazing for me to get my life back on track, with no sexual or weight issues- I actually have a higher sex drive and lost weight.  Now fellow bipolars: I know you worry about losing the manic aspects or being completely numb but this drug ain't like that. I still get easily controlled hypomania occasionally without the drop after, and feel minorly elevated every single day. I love this pill dude. Only negatives are diplopia, amenorrhea, and its hard to cry. But its so worth it.",9

Dissociated constantly and had facial muscle movement issues. Was eventually taken off after 8 months. Worked up to 200mg lamotrigine slowly. I felt no concept of time or the fact I'd face issues for my impulsivity. It basically made me like a zombie.,2

Kpin is down to .25mg, 2-3x/month so I know the lamictal is helping my anxiety and insomnia. OCD is WAY improved as well. Oh, and I was really afraid of the weight gain with mood stabilizers but at my yearly checkup last week I found out that I'd LOST 20 lbs over the last year without even realizing it.",10

Bev,"April 4, 2018",For Seizure Prevention:,"I have had ""stroke like""  simple partial seizures for 2 1/2 years and first diagnosed with mini strokes. The doctor first put me on KEPPRA and increased it gradually up to 1000 mg twice daily and would still have these seizures two or more weekly with ""zombie""effects.   Finely she gradually brought me down to 500 mg of KEPPRA and up to 150 mg of Lamotrigine.  After 7 months I have had 2 seizures, one in the build up stage and another following a very stressful time.   Side effects seem light compared to the large amount of KEPPRA.  I do have a little off balance, some light rashes and forgetfulness but overall I am unbelievably better.  I am 74 and some of these side effects may be from age.",
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I switched between 25 MG oral suspension Lamictal to a generic Kroger brand of lamotrigine after starting the Lamictal in drug and alcohol treatment/recovery. The initial 25mg brand name Lamictal worked wonders and balanced my depressive and manic episodes. However, once I ran out and changed doctors a few weeks later and got the generic, the generic lamotrigine began to CAUSE migraines for me with such a heavy aura that I was nearly blind and could not focus on any objects (nearly every day I took it) I was put on 80 mg propranolol to help with the migraines as a preventative but it did not help prevent them until i got off the lamotrigine. After missing just 1 dose while I was still taking generic lamotrigine I developed a crazily itchy rash in both of my armpits at which point I discontinued use. Would only recommend others the name brand Lamictal due to the fact that the inactive ingredients are different between generic and name brand/main supplier and can worsen conditions.",2

I stopped the Zoloft  and did sleep therapy, and regular therapy. I was feeling good but I still had some of that intense anxiety.  I was TERRIFIED to try another drug after my experience with Zoloft but lamotrigine has helped me enormously. I’m only on 7.5 (yes 7.5, not 75mgs) and it’s made a big difference. Going up to 10mgs.

Nothing worked until I was prescribed Lamictal. Thank God for this medication.

I am on day 3 and don’t feel 100% yet but have noticed I’m getting more housework done and feel more hopeful, less angry, and less chaotic in my own head. My mind feels clearer and more crisp.

Pros: 
• cheap (usually a few dollars depending on the pharmacy)

No seizures yet but they aren't that common to begin with (1x/year) and I've only been on lamotrigine for a few months.  I'm at 300mg/day now and trying to get up to 400mg.  Dizziness is pretty bad right now, that rocking feeling you get after being on a boat.  I feel that.",9

The best way I can describe the effectiveness is that they take the edge of the intensity of bad mood swings. 

Negatives: 
According to my doctor and a lot of things I've read, Lamotrigine is unsuitable for Bi Polar Type 1. 
I also found once I'd increased my dosage to 250ml, my moods were too suppressed  and so eventually lowered my dose and came off them altogether.

I went to ER right away and they said to stop taking the lamotrigene as it was allergic reaction and gave me benadryl and prednisone to take for 5 days for the allergic reaction.

My energy did improve, though I'm not positive that it was due to the new XR. I do think that taking the XR version is worth it to keep the level in your blood more stable. My psychiatrist says she usually switches patients to XR after finding the right dose. The XR is more expensive than the regular release, but my copay for both is the same because they are both generics.",10

(Was at 200mg and my guess at 300mg it would of been completely gone)

Only issues I had with lamotrigine was randomly breaking out in a few pimples - not a lot but noticeable. For me personally I think it can be an affective medication for bipolar. (And for the ones who experience Hypomania/Mixed states from SSRI meds, and not having a complete bipolar diagnosis)

It didn't help my depression but I'm in the land of 'Treatment resistant' so that didn't surprise me much either.",9

My depression has lifted and I haven't been manic, altho I think I've still had some mixed states and some outbursts. I'm learning to take better care of myself to avoid those. Getting sober helped.

I give this medicine a 7 because it definitely helped stabilize my moods and I became less irritable.  I'm discontinuing my use this week to try lithium.  I hear great things about lithium and am tired of the inconsistency I've been getting with lamotrigine as of late.

At first, I accidentally took all 50mg in the morning instead of splitting it which gave me a minor body rash, but once I stopped taking it all at once, it cleared up in a few days. I get very real lucid nightmares though, however I’ve also had a few real dreams while on it which have been amazing and beautiful. So really the nightmares are the downfall for me.

My second attempt was a resounding success thanks to Lamictal and a great doctor. I have been taking it for about a year and have only had one depressive episode (it was triggered by a difficult event) in that time when I previously would have one at least monthly. The impact of Lamictal was very quick and I did not have significant side effects. I am currently on 150 mg daily and I am happy to stay on it for life if necessary.

It gets stuck in the back of my throat and I have to spend so much time to not throw it up during the times I can't get it down the first try. Then I have to spend 10-15 min scrubbing my tongue to get the taste out. Even with juice or other strong tasting beverages/food if I don't get that pill down the first time it's horrible.

Anxiety gone, I wouldn’t feel so bad anymore for my thoughts or decisions (they’re not bad crazy ones) I could function better. I could handle work better. Went up to 150mg, and after 3 weeks on it I noticed I started to become depressed about how I automatically think and perceive life. It’s really really strange and hard to explain. I went down to 125mg, and added pristiq 25mg. I’m still not significantly better, but it’s early on with pristiq.

At first, I liked being able to turn them off, but now it's becoming a curse. I don't mean that it helped me control my emotions; I mean I literally can turn them all off like a switch. I no longer care about anything at all, not even if I live or die. When I do this, I feel soulless, but cannot care that I am. It is truly horrible and is slowly ruining my life.

I felt no positive effects. For sure nausea and vomiting, suicidal, and urges to cut. I also felt itchy all the time and had a low grade fever but I had other physical health issues going on at the time, so I’m not sure if those last ones were directly related to the lamotrigine or not.

My mood swings are less severe and don’t occur as often, and I’m able to cope with life again. It isn’t a magic cure all, most medications aren’t and I think that’s where some people get confused and frustrated, but it’s allowed me to be mentally stable enough to access other mental health services such as therapy. Since going on Lamictal my quality of life has increased drastically.

The only side effect I experience is if I take it too late in the day, it keeps me awake at night.",10
,,For Epilepsy:,"No longer depressed.
No longer having seizures.
My mood has been stable.
But I have been physically fatigued more often than not to the extent that I wouldn't get much work done.
I would get restless at night, hours after taking the pills.
Insomnia
And body pains.

Otherwise, for its purpose. I have been able to go through days without depression and seizures episodes. I would just like to address the other side effects.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Lamotrigine gave me headaches, and I was fine with it until the rash started to set in. I developed a rash under my eyes. around my mouth and chin and on my hands. Not every medication works for everyone and the side effects need to be more talked about.",4
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"Started off on Lamictal about 3 months ago. I was having severe mood swings and was diagnosed with Bi Polar 2. Lamictal has been by far the best medicine I’ve tried. No weight gain, not severely tired. I would take it around 5pm after work, and be totally fine. What I did notice was that is associated with Stevens Johnson syndrome. 

My dr at the time bumped me up to 200 mg within 2 weeks (big mistake) and my body started reacting to it. 

I now have cystic acne on my face. The withdrawal from coming off the medication (because my side affects got bad..  Night terrors, cystic acne) were extremely irritably, lethargic, headaches) 

I’m talking to my dr about lowering the dosage because we all know that finding medication to fit is hard. I also wanted this medication in case I became pregnant",9
,,For Borderline Personality Disorder:,"About 4 months ago started my BPDBorderline Personality Disorder  treatment using lamictal. Got up to 75mg and have been on that for some time. I have definitely noticed a change in specifically my suicidality and mood swings, which has been great help in my day to day functions and outlook on life. Unfortunately I am also experiencing some of the side affects, such as spots, drowsiness, and -most intensely/recently- nausea. The nausea has caused me to have a tough time meeting any real nutritional needs during my day, which is especially troublesome for a co-occurring ED, but I am working with it the best I can because in my mind, the positives are outweighing the negatives. The spots scared me because I thought it was a rash, but ended up just going away. Nausea/loss of appetite has really been the only impactful side effect I’ve had.",8
Anonymous,"February 12, 2015",For Bipolar Disorder:,"Officially diagnosed as bipolar II, I have highly recurrent depressive episodes (since early teens) and have had a handful of mild hypomanias. Overall I would consider my general moods as being dysphoric/depressive and agitated/anxious.

I take 250mg/day and it has done wonders for me. I no longer get depressed in the same way I used to. No more weeks on end of feeling rejected, lonely and sad. No more fears it may worsen into a deeper depression where I can barely get out of bed. Now, if I do get depressed, it's minor and goes away in a day. The longest has been 2 days.

Find the right dose. 300mg made me agitated/hypomanicky. Also the cognitive side effects at that level were horrible. However, at my current dose, all is good.",8
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on this medication twice; for 3 years in my early 20s, and I've been on it for the past 5 years. It has been the only stabilizer which helps even out my mood swings without feeling drugged. Lamotrigine stops my bipolar depressive episodes from happening as often.
Initially it caused body aches and fatigue, which I normally deal with due to fibromyalgia, but noticed it each time the dose increased. Started at 12.5mg and increased by 12.5 every 10 days. 150mg is the most I can take without the side effects becoming noticeable.
This medication needs to be worked with a little bit in order to get the dose where it should be.",8

I have had a lot of ups (wedding, incredible family time) and downs (work stress, financial problems) the last month. I won't lie, there have been a few days when I end up back in bed feeling so depressed like I did earlier this year when I was at my lowest point ever. But... I have been able to get through the few tough days and bounce back to what I feel is my normal self. My husband helps me keep tabs on how I'm acting, and I've headed back up again, But I'd rather be on the ""up"" end than back on the low end.",9

I've never seen a medicine that said it could outright freakin kill me if I take it. But I thought, that I'm being slowwwwwly titrated up, for safety reasons. I took it this morning at 8AM and its 1PM I'm dizzy and my sense of space is just gone, but that's absolutely nothing I can't handle lol. I feel like my brain has a blanket on it lol its very comfy. I feel like this dizzy feeling will most definitely fade soon as my body gets used to it. For those just starting lamotrigine, feel safe if you're starting 25mg and slowly going up. You'll be alright! Just be aware of yourself.",8

Or what else can I do to control seizures?",5
,,For Anxiety:,"Been taking this med for depression, anxiety and BPD.  While it is not a miracle drug that will solve the issues completely it will help calm your mind and help with mood swings.  I don't always realize how much it helps until I stop taking it for a few days.   It's at least worth a try if you suffer from similar issues.   It helps keep me stable enough to focus on counseling which is a necessity.  Medication alone will not get me where I want to be in life.",8
,,For Epilepsy:,I began taking lamotrigine on 23 February 2017 and it stopped my seizures but I had to suffer poor balance and my dizziness which was terrible and did not fully go away.

After that I felt pretty good for 2 years. I slipped into depression again, low self esteem so was put me back on Lamictal (200mg) and i immediately felt really good. But it didn't last long; depression, anxiety, losing hair, gaining weight, acne, and today began developing a rash on my hands and a sore neck. I'm worried but I'm afraid of taking something else.",
Kev,"March 8, 2019",For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on lamictal for 2 months now. Before starting lamictal, I was on Wellbutrin, topamax and Latuda.

I’m not sure if I can take Latuda and lamictal together or not. ",
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I switched from generic immediate release lamotrigine to lamictal XR about a week ago. In the last week I have had the unfortunate and horrible side effect of diarrhea. The worst I have ever experienced; it would start a few hours after taking my meds (at bedtime...) and last until about noon the following day. It took me about a week to realize it was related to the medication change. When I stopped taking the medication the diarrhea went away. I've seen tons of positive reviews about the XR, but it just wasn't for me. I gave it a 3 because it still stabilized my mood while I was on it.",3
AK,"July 26, 2021",For Bipolar Disorder:,"PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU FEEL YOUR BODY ODOR HAS CHANGED AND FOOD/SMELLS ARE DIFFERENT!! 
I was on lamotrigine for 4 months since I am borderline bi-polar. As soon as I started taking this my body odor changed (not for the better) my taste and smell changed. Food did not taste good, nor did it smell good. (It smelled and tasted like my BO!) 
JUST BECAUSE IT IS NOT LISTED DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT A SIDE EFFECT! 
I recently went into my PCM, and told her of the problem I was having.
After speaking with her for less than 3 minutes about these issues, she told me I wasn't crazy!
A RARE SIDE EFFECT OF LAMOTRIGINE IS ALTERED TASTE AND SMELL!! 
Please if you have symptoms and the doctor is not listening, get second opinions! 
Take with caution and know the side effects listed!!

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I was prescribed this drug after I had what my psychiatrist called a period of elevated mood during which I engaged in some illegal behavior, misdemeanor attempt to invade the privacy of another. 
I recognized my inappropriate behavior, amended it and have not repeated it in 9 & 1/2 years.  While on Lamictal, I was mostly flat. Nothing excited me, gave me joy or was even much fun. 
Over the next couple years I had several episodes of brutal depression .
I really didn't like the drug. 
I eventually weaned myself off of ft, and feel much better. No manic or hypomania since cessation  and less depression, & its less severe.

I believe  Lamictal permanently altered my brain function. The inability to have fun , the lack of anything exciting, and the flatness of emotions - are less severe , but still present in my life. 

I wish it were not so.  
I’m am still somewhat resentful for having to ever take this medicine.",1
,,For Epilepsy:,"I have a love and extreme dislike relationship with the medication. It has aided me in reducing the amount of seizures I have, now using 400mg a day, combined with two other types of medication. I haven't had grand-mal seizures for over a year now. But, I truly feel it has many side effects. The memory loss (both long and short term), brain fog and suppressing nature, make me feel as though I am not maturing and am stuck being a child. I feel like I'm a teenager and have issues making decisions, evaluating the past and looking to the future. I am now wanting to change the medication, but am so insecure, it drives me insane.",4
,,For Schizoaffective Disorder:,"I was introduced to 100mg of Lamictal originally in combination with 20mg of saphris. At this point I was hallucinating frequently and suicidal but no crying spells. I had to reduce the saphris to 10 mg because of unbearable akathisia. My doctor tried to counter the lowering of my saphris with an increase of Lamictal to 200mg to attempt to keep a hold on my mood disorderliness. My depression continued to be the same but my psychosis increased with the lowered saphris dosage. We then tried 400mg of Lamictal in a last grasp for hope with its usage as a mood stabilizer, but it failed miserably and I was hospitalized after horrible crying spells and hostile psychosis. Lamictal was for me at best a placebo and at worse counter effective.",
MENO PAUSE,"May 15, 2010",For Bipolar Disorder:,"Today is May 15, I started at a low dose of 25mg cut in half. I do notice I'm not having the fears.

I have no side effects that I'm aware of yet. I am just starting out and on such a low dose. After reading all others here, I think I would like to stay on a lower dose, maybe less than 100mg. We will see. There is another part of me that just does not want any of this but the reality of it all is, I may feel this way now because the medicines are working. I have been on 100mg of Seroquel for 5 years for sleep. I am going to start to wean down and maybe off it, on Doctor's recommendation of course.",5

The only draw back was having to slowing increase the dosage at the beginning due to the rash you can get. Well worth the wait though.",8

I broke my hand from boxer's fracture and my doc found out about it. Said I ""needed"" these meds to control my ""moodiness"". So I gradually moved up to 100mg x2 daily. I began to take them on schedule, as I had been forgetting to. Like clockwork I became so impatient with EVERYTHING and was always angry over nothing! Needless to say I quit cold turkey. I know you're not supposed to, but I'm not touching those things ever again. I have been in such a better mood and am back to my fun self. STAY AWAY!",1

I quickly went into a downward spiral where all of the above listed side effects compounded as it built up in my body. I made an emergency appointment for me Dr. to come make a house call and he immediately told me that I needed to change medication. I was put on Lamotrigine and within two days (it took roughly 48 hours for the dilantin to completely leave my system) I started feeling more energetic, more hopeful and the nausea subsided.

I tried Wellbutrin - which made me full of rage and even violent and Abilify - which made me excessively more impulsive (gambling, drinking, smoking - all of which I would normally not do).
Lamotrigine has been a God-send.  The cycling has slowed to a near halt.  I have a few mild down cycles, but they are few and far between and subside quickly.

It has allowed me to show up and be a better daughter, sister, friend, and coworker. I have enough energy and patience to go through my day. I don’t feel overwhelmed all the time like I used to. I am fortunate enough to have experienced no side effects so far.

Helped relieve my anxiety and balanced out my cycling. Non-sedating. Anti-seizure agent, so I am comfortable combining it with Adderall IR/XR and Wellbutrin XL. Be careful combining with Depakote however, because the interaction causes the concentration of Lamictal to increase.",10

Anonymous,"January 7, 2011",For Bipolar Disorder:,"I've been on Lamictal for three years for Bipolar disorder and Epilepsy, at first as a mood stabilizer and then as an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer.  It's been excellent at treating the bipolar issues, virtually eradicating the mood episodes (with the exception of a couple of days of minor hypomania here and there) and helping a little bit with the coexisting anxiety issues.   However, it hasn't been any good at controlling my seizures, although it's made them a lot less severe than they were before I went on higher doses of Lamictal.  I haven't had any major side effects, or any at all outside of an increased sensitivity to rashes.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,I was hypermanic off of just 5-10mg of lexapro so then got diagnosed with atypical bipolar disorder and I was switched to lamictal over a year ago. Apparently it’s one of the most effective mood stabilizers and my behavioral issues are worse without it but idk is it okay. I don’t know if i’ve become tolerant to it though.,4
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Epilepsy:,"I am currently titrating up to help my  day and nocturnal seizures. I am at 50mg morning and night. So far it seems to have helped with the nocturnal but increased my seizures during the day. If you are in Scotland and its the weekend you can go to a chemist and they can supply you with a week of medication to tide you over should you run out, so you don't miss any doses. They will sort out the paperwork and inform your GP that they have given you that medication. Take a repeat slip if you have one and try to stick to a regular chemist and obviously try to remember to order.. easier said than done with multiple medications and memory problems. Your chemist can also order them and deliver if needed.",3
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,I was diagnosed with Bipolar II in August 2017 and I was a lucky one being put on a medication that worked pretty well for me on the first go around. I started with 25mg of lamotrogine and gradually progressed to 200mg over several months (which was how it was planned from the beginning) it has helped a ton and I feel way more stable and think much clearer. I do still have manic episodes from time to time which can be mild or severe. I take anxiety meds when I can to ease the mania but sometimes those don’t help. I just recently had seroquel added at night to further stablize me and hopefully stop the mania almost completely but I won’t know for a few days how that will work. Overall I haven’t had any negative side effects at all with lamotrogine!,8
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"After 2 years and a horrible experience on lithium, I was put on lamotrigine. I started at 50mg/day...once I increased to 100mg/day, I turned into a complete zombie: wasn't happy, sad, mad...nothing. Just went through the motions. After 2 months of this, my vision got so bad that I couldn’t drive at night, and I had constant muscle pain. Then my hair started falling out in handfuls. After losing half of my hair, I gave up. My doctor has now switched me to Depakote. Maybe I’ll be one of the lucky ones that it works for!",1
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I have been on this medication twice before. I stopped only because I found out I was pregnant.This medication didn't ever make a significant change, but my mood gradually was getting better. I'm now going back to the psych doctor and will probably try and get back on this one again.
I do know the manufacturer that my pharmacy uses of the lamotrigine... so chalky and tastes so incredibly disgusting I despised taking it. Maybe if I can find a different kind, all will be wonderful?",9
,,For Anxiety:,Game changer/Life saver! Thyroid issues mimicking depression/anxiety through my life. Tried various SSRI’s for last 20 years. Finally being diagnosing hyperthyroidism which explained the anxiety and then radioactive Iodine made me Hypothyroid. Taking Synthroid now for life. Thyroid flares/unbalance made anxiety/depression beyond bearable. November 2017- I checked into a psych hospital because I need a comprehensive safe place. No shocker but my THS number( thyroid) was off the charts. . . This is where I was first given Lamictal. The last five years has been my longest episode free period. I use Lamictal along with Cymbalta and Prozac. I highly recommend trying Lamictal for reoccurring crippling anxiety/depression.,10
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine):,"I have had a good experience with this medication. It has kept my moods even; I have less rage. I do have concerns about hair loss. Over the three years of taking this, I have had a lot of hair loss. Is there any advice that can help?",8
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I am on the autistic spectrum, so I'm used to the ups and downs. However, for the last 10 years - I have experienced severe lows where I neglect myself, the house ends up an absolute mess, my spending is really irresponsible and I skip rent without thinking of the consequences. I *know* better than to do this but my mind just crashes. I don't recognise myself as I'm usually a very tidy person.

My GP put me on lamotrigine (lamictal) and it's helped a LOT. I feel like I'm more myself, I am showering, eating actual food instead of crap and I am tidying, working out etc. The difference is significant and I slowly manage my weight better too. Friends can tell when I've skipped meds because I am so different off them.

Downside is I became prone to insomnia, but if I am strict with a sleep pattern/good sleep hygiene, I'm fine. I get a little nauseous too but it's worth it for the positives, personally.",9
,,For Epilepsy:,"It's a very calm medicine being diagnosed of ADHD after catching the virus of meningitis. It has been a very long 9 year journey for me. It helps with seizures, a lot of anxiety, hyper-ness, depression, and stress.  I've been taking it for up to 9 months to 1 year. I'm currently a 23 year old woman. I became sick with the virus at 14 so yesss I've been in a good five through six medications throughout the nine years and this is a very good one !!!! It's also prescribed for bipolar depression.",8
,,For Seizure Prevention:,"I suffer from nocturnal seizures, and was only having 1-2 a year prior to meds. Since I've been on Lamictal, I haven't had seizures (taking it 2x/day) but man... I'm having struggling with the myriad of side effects. I'm only 30, and ever since I introduced prescription meds into my life - I have SO many ""health"" problems. Other than my seizures, I had zero physical problems prior to being on meds. 

Now I have insomnia, my vision is blurry, muscle spasms/vertigo in the mornings, my coordination sucks, I'm always lethargic, and I get tongue-tied and slur all the time. I also got a severe rash on my face and neck the first week I was on Lamictal. But the worst part? I can't remember ANYTHING, can't concentrate, and I'm zoned out all the time. The cognitive impact is negatively impacting me at work and is causing frustration within my relationships. It feels like I just can't win with anticonvulsants. Is all of this really worth it? I don't know anymore...",5
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"By far the best medication I’ve taken. I’m stable! I have hobbies, money and no debt from impulse spending anymore! No more failed friendships from the fall out with mood swings. I will never skip a dose willingly. This medication is truly an awesome tool when paired with therapy to live your best life despite bipolar diagnosis. I encourage everyone to give Lamotrigine a chance and keep an open mind. As others said, my medicine cabinet looked like a pharmacy. I was on three different medications for bipolar at one time. I am on just Lamotrigine at this point. I would never make a review about medication but this genuinely changed my life and I’ve taken a lot of medication. I promise you, this one is worth considering. If it works for you, it works well.",10
,,For Anxiety:,This medication changed my life. No more anxiety or depression. Unfortunately after about two weeks of taking it I did develop a rash and had to stop taking it immediately. Best two weeks of my life in years. Only other side effect that I had was I needed very little sleep and I had a lot of energy.,8
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"I was taking 50 mg of Lamictal and 20mg of Lexapro to combat BPD and Bipolar 2 symptoms. After 1 year of no luck and my work performance in the tank, social life non existent, not respecting myself, and aquiring severe credit card debt, my psychiatrist and I decided to drop the lexapro and turn the lamictal up to 200 mg. 

Since doing that (5 weeks ago) my work performance has sky rocketed, I'm able to face my fears better and let things go at a quicker rate. I have had more energy than I can remember,  losing 17 pounds. I'm wanting to be the social butterfly I'm known to be and wanting to be seen in healthy ways. In addition, my marijuana desire has dropped substantially and my hair picking addition that I've struggled with my entire life has subsided. I am curious to see how this continues to play out, but I'm very grateful to be on the right track with only taking Lamictal. Hope this helps!",10
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I was given lamotrigine to help with my mood disorder about a year and a half ago. I used to have very extreme emotions and rapid mood swings. Since getting to the right dose (150mg twice a day), I no longer get mood swings of extreme emotions.
I've experienced no adverse effects. My only complaint would be my emotions are a bit dulled, but I need that really.

I was using Sertraline before I had my Lamotrigine, but I stopped using it soon after. The lamotrigine was definitely way more effective with way less side effects.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I just started this week. Currently on 25mg for 2 weeks then will be on 50mg for 2 weeks then finally 100mg. So far, I like it. I know that when I get a higher dose it will work even better. I will write another review in a month or two.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Started off at 25 mg and now at 50 mg. It took about a month to start working but it was worth the wait. Lamotrigine has changed my life in the better in so many ways. Less insecure thoughts, all around more clear headed, my self loathing stopped as well making my relationships with other humans are healthier and effortless. 

I’ve never been happy in my life. Before I knew I was bipolar, I thought my manic episodes were me being happy, but I wasn’t happy. My happy episodes were euphoric, like I was on a high. And the I would gradually crash into my deep depression. With Lamotrigine, I feel happy, very content with life. But not overly joyous, no feelings of euphoria. I feel so consistent with my day to day life. 

Lamotrigine changed my life forever. Don’t sleep on this!!!",
,,For Epilepsy:,I was on lamotrigine for 18 months now was taking 150 2 times a day I decided to go  take the full 200mg  like the Dr said. Wow this is difficult. The 150mg had break through seizures but man this dose has me feeling depressed. I would give the depression a 5 out of 10 rating but man this really is such a big change it feels. Everything isn't so important as once use to be. I have a so what character now but only been on it 5 days have to give it a chance. The 150mg dose had to many break through seizures,4
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"My experience with lamotrigine is actually contrary to what the app cautions regarding depression and suicidal thoughts. This may be exclusive to me, but I found it took the suicidal/self-harm edge off my depressive episodes, so much that I can’t even form thoughts on the subject. I realize this sounds ridiculous, but I have been taking this medication since 2016 and it’s been working ever since; it quite literally saved my life two weeks ago. NOTE that it is NOT a miracle drug, I had taken the wrong dose the day before because being in a bad place makes one forgetful. That aside, the side effects are more annoying than nasty to get used to, especially since I had the rare eye-related ones, but I’ve gone from 50mg to 350mg and my eyes are no longer fatigued, nor do I lack a sense of balance. I was taking a lot of meds with overlapping SE so it’s hard to say exactly how it was, but I can say it was worth it, which is more than I can say about at least 7 other ones.",9
,,Lamictal (lamotrigine) for Bipolar Disorder:,"This is the first medication I am taking for Bipolar Disorder. It has been half a year now and for me it works when it comes to rapid cycling and extreme depressive episodes. On 200mg, there were no side effects except some itchiness of the skin but there never were signs of a rash. Then my psychiatrist put me on 300mg since my lamotrigine levels were quite low. This was awful. Constant nausea with an extreme gag reflex. Back to 200mg and everything was fine again. My stomach is still very sensitive though and combining Lamictal with other types of medication has been impossible so far. So yes, for me (!) it works for Bipolar Disorder but it is hard to treat my other symptoms like anxiety, heavy dissociation and low mood in general. But this is probably due to me being very sensitive when it comes to any kind of medication.",7
,,,"After trying cannabis for the fourth time in my life I got the rare neurological disorder hallucinogen persisting perception disorder that gives permanent visual disturbances, visual pseudohallucinations and often a crippling brain fog and a head pressure that makes it feel like the head is about to pop. Lamotrigine is one of the few meds that have been shown to be able to reduce or remove some of these symptoms and in my case it completely took away the hallucinations, brain fog and head pressure, so it made me functional again. Sadly it didn't do anything for the visual snow and other visual disturbances. So I would say that this med saved my life.",10
,,For Depression:,"This drug is THE WORST. Long story short…back in December I developed anxiety and panic attacks that were situational. I was put in lexapro and had adverse effects. Put on Zoloft, adverse effects. Put on lamotrigine and I  was seriously suicidal. I have never been suicidal or had depression or anxiety in the past, like I said my situation was acute. This medication had the absolute worst side effects. Suicidal ideations, excessive crying, severe anxiety, panic attacks, depression (that I really didn’t have to begin with), hair loss, itching, labile mood, rash that did go away, abnormal thinking. And I was only on this for FIVE WEEKS. I am tapering off this as we speak. I know for some it helps, but honestly this is poison to me. I want others to know if you experience these side effects and you’re on this medication IT’S NOT YOU!!! I have three weeks left until I’m off of this stuff and I cannot wait. I’d give it a zero if I could…",1
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"When I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar disorder, after coming out of my first and only admission for mania and spending months with depression that only came out a few days, they only gave me valproic acid which depresses me. Quetiapine worked for a while, but I had to stop take it at high doses for constipation and rhinitis. With aripiprazole for 2 whole days vomiting, with cariprazine for a whole month with akathisia, and olanzapine only depressed me, and I saw that there was Symbyax (olanzapine plus fluoxetine) that in 6 days took me out of the Depression. I managed to change psychiatrists, I told him that I was still sleeping 10 hours a day and mentally dull with Symbyax. Then finally I got prescribed 100mg of lamotrigine and 50mg of quetiapine, it is the best combination for me, it does not make me fat at such a low dose, and since then I sleep only 8-7 hours and I can continue with my life without depression, mania or drowsiness. Thank God they gave me Lamotrigine. I am from Spain and sorry if I made some mistake.",10

Family history of ""eccentric behavior"" on my mother's side which we have recently realized is a history of BPII.

I currently take 1x 150mg lamotrigine and 1x 300mg bupropion XL per day and have never felt more like myself. Little annoyances bother me less, I'm able to care less about what others think of me and I'm able to identify why I'm feeling a certain way far more consistently. There was a bit of insomnia in the beginning but have now settled in to a regular routine and almost never get any side effects (besides maybe mild nausea now and then). One of my biggest concerns with starting a mood stabilizer was that I would feel duller in some vague way. Not only do I still feel mentally sharp, my thinking feels less ""noisy"" Overall a lightweight and effective med",9

I am still on hydroxizine 40mg and Trieptal 300mg (never experienced a single problem with those two) , SUPPOSED to be taking Lamotrigine, but it honeslty felt like taking all the other medications. I was put on the medication because my doctor told me I was ""too manic"" (baked bread at 2am, cleaned the kitchen and organized everything I could). Day 1 of Lamotrigine 25mg, I slept for 20 hours, stared at a wall for a whole hour, and cried because I was felt funny and got nothing done. Day 2 of Lamotrigine 25mg, I took it a few hours before work, I ended up at work a lot, crying for no reason, my heartbeat was so fast and I felt high, and I had a terrible panic attack to the point where I was rescued out of the bathroom. I stopped taking Lamotrigine 25mg and felt better.",1

I’ve not experienced ANY side affects. Highly recommend this wonder drug. It has saved me.,

And now they are putting up my meds yet again, it’s starting to feel like they purposely trying to give me Steven Johnson’s syndrome.

,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"I began with a dose of 50mg as a monotherapy for depressive swings and agitated hypomamia. As soon as I reached the 150mg mark, it was like a gear shifted. Every suicidal thought in my mind was just *poof* gone. It's been about six months now, and I've not had one thought of harming myself. It's unreal. Also, bonus: NO WEIGHT GAIN (applause!). Minimal side effects include headaches, dry skin, and mild hair loss. Now for the reasons why I knocked off two points. Horrendous insomnia. I had to add 50mg of Seroquel into the mix for sleep, and I'm lucky if I get a solid 5 hours. I also need an additional 50mg Seroquel PRN for agitation when I feel myself getting hypomanic. Unfortunately, Lamictal does zilch for anxiety and mania. It doesn't help with paranoia or impulsivity. Still, I'd hate to go off of it because of how effective it's been for suicidal ideation. For those considering Lamictal, it's definitely worth it for depression, but it's not effective alone for bipolar disorder.",8

Within the first few days of starting on a low dose I almost felt like all the static in my head was toned down. I could sort through my not so racing thoughts and not feel overwhelmed. I really had a moment where I asked myself is this what normal feels like? This felt foreign to me. I nearly cried realizing I have been struggling silently and wondered why no one tried this in the past. I do take it at night as I was extremely tired taking it during the day. I still go through episodes but not nearly as bad. Some night sweats and vivid dreams but I will take that any day than how I felt before starting this medicine. Give it a chance!!

I was on this medication for 3 weeks and I went to my local ER twice because I had a severe headache that lasted over 9 days. I went to the ER and was told it was a migraine. I then noticed that I had swollen lymph nodes and a skin rash that started appearing on my face and chest. I then became concerned that all these things were side effects from lamictal and when I went to ER for the 3rd time I was told to stop taking this immediately as it could lead to a life threatening rash. I’m sad I experienced these side effects because of all the positive reviews. Just beware of all these side effects that could appear because they could be very dangerous.,1

Not had a grand mal for three years and have absence seizures but rare  no where near as much as I did.  This drug has caused very little side effects I can't even recall one to be honest and if anything it has gave me confidence to stand up for myself for some weird reason lol.

,,For Epilepsy:,"I have had absence seizures since I was young. I'm now 27 and still suffering from them. This is the first medication that was prescribed to me and I can confidently say that this experience has been as awful as when I had shingles. I had a headache that never went away, body aches, chills, a cough, and fevers that turned into a rash all over my face and body. Benadryl and steroid cream (as harmful as it is) used to work wonders for me, but they're not doing anything right now to relieve me of the itch.

This said, the Mental Health team subsequently asked me if (bluntly speaking) I would think of doing it again or actually do it again but I couldn’t give a 100% no. This along with my irregular sleep pattern, feeling depressed and next to no motivation and double vision from time-to-time makes me angry and frustrates me knowing that I have been prescribed drugs for a condition that seems to unearth others that have pretty much always been dismissed let alone even thought of. Anxiety is the worst. I’m constantly on edge.

I start on a low dose and slowly increased it but as soon as I started taking it I became manic depressive, having vivid visions of harming myself/making plans, very bad suicidal ideation, being very angry and just amplifying all my mood swings. I will admit that it could just be ineffective and my mood is just getting worse by itself because I experienced all of the mood fluctuations before I start taking them but they have gotten 10x worse. My depression got really bad so did my numbness and dissociation. I can’t talk most of the time because I’m so depressed my mind just dissociates to protect itself , well that’s how it feels.

I was deeply resistant to try another drug, but my doctor finally convinced me to start Lamictal. My symptoms of depression are now almost as bad as they were before I started the TMS and Ketamine.

I still have some sad moments, mostly in morning but once lamotrigine kicks in from morning dose I come right. No side effects at all.",9
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,"Does this drug actually work? I’ve read a lot of promising reviews, so it must for some people. However, most published studies show it has little if any efficacy in the treatment of acute depression in bipolar. I’ve taken it on and off for years, sometimes at doses as high as 300mg, and it does nothing. No side effects luckily, but it just has absolutely no effect on me whatsoever. Disappointed because so many describe it as a miracle drug, but I have my doubts about its efficacy now.",2
,,For Bipolar Disorder:,The best medication ever for me. Overall I've been taking it for a couple of  years now. It never caused any side effects for me and really helped with my mood swings. Highly recommend it: it worked for me and and maybe will help you too. Good luck!,10

,,For Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:,"I have PTSD from prolonged sexual abuse and the aftermath of speaking up about it when I was younger. I also had noticed a very defined mood/energy cycle for many years, but because the cycle was fairly rapid and the energetic end of it was anxiety, agitation, and what I called ""energetic sadness"" with suicidal thoughts. There had been four major recurrences of PTSD symptoms in my life since the things happened 25 years ago, and the most recent lasted 3 years and was the worst. During this time the energetic side of the cycle would cause suicidal ideation.  When the episode subsided, the underlying cycle became more extreme in some ways, while most of the suicide thoughts had decreased.  I was on Vyvanse for ADHD as well.  I talked to my psychiatrist about the cycle a few times and when it got more extreme she said it sounded like cyclothymia so she started me on Lamotrigine.  All symptoms are gone.  If this is happiness, then I've never been happy before! It's like a new life!",10
