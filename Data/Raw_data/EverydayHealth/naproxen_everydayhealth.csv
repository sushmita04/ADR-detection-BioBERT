Have never had any serious health issues before taking this medication, however, after simply taking naproxen one night for the first time for period pain I woke up a few hours later with intense chest pain, heart palpitations, and vomiting. Ended up getting an ambulance to ER two days later as I thought I was about to have a heart attack. Three months later and I am still dealing with the side effects of stomach cramps, nausea, shaking, chest pain/tightness, chills, heart palpitations, hot flushes, and anxiety."
9/30/2021 12:53:52 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Tendonitis Report ,"I was prescribed Naproxen for my tendonitis {wrist} and I still have not taken it, I don't know what it was that made me wait, perhaps when I was given the medication and the paperwork with it, it was very intimidating the paperwork was as thick as a war and peace book, I did my own research and after reading the reviews, I think I will pass and continue to take tylenol, and go back to my doctor for different alternatives, this is to much, and normally if I have to take something for my health and the betterment, I am okay with it, but for some darn reason I could not get myself to take this stuff, and now thanks to the reviews, I am trashing this Naproxen, I hope everyone on this page, good health and healing..."
7/16/2021 4:39:29 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Dysmenorrhea Report ,"I have been diagnosed with dysmenorrhea (severe painful menstrual cramps) and I usually take Tylenol but I ran out and woke up at 4am with the cramps, so I had to go to the nearest open gas station. They didn't have Tylenol, but they had Aleve. I read before that prostaglandins are the cause of menstrual cramps, so when I read that Aleve helps with that, I thought it would be a good second choice. I took two at once, as it said I was able to in the first hour, and as the cramps started gradually going away, the stomach pain showed up and became more and more severe. I was hoping to go back to sleep because I have to work today, but I have been running to the restroom to poop and I have been extremely gassy. These stomach pains are brutal, I almost want to make myself throw it up."
6/5/2021 7:28:55 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Pain Report ,Aleve worked great for excruciating pain I had from fibro and arthritis. It did not give me any stomach problems whatsoever and I have IBS. So my suggestion to anybody wanting to try it is maybe try one pill and if no stomach problems then increase the dose

4/11/2021 10:16:10 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Dysmenorrhea Report ,"Takes closer to 2-3 hours to kick in. But once it does, it eliminates the menstrual pain entirely. It does not last 12 hours for me, I find myself having to take one every 6-7 hours to keep the pain away. I experience some side effects like drowsiness, dizziness/lightheadedness, and just overall feeling kind of loopy. It does the job in the long run but I wish it kicked in faster/was more long-lasting."

3/2/2021 1:01:28 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Headache Report ,"Got prescribed 500mg of Naproxen for my headaches and they actually did help to relieve my pain for the most part. However, I started experiencing side effects just one day after my first dose. I stopped taking them after my second dose, which was 3 days ago, and I’ve still been dealing with abdominal pain (both burning and sharp), nausea, chills and vomit. So not only do I have these new problems but I still have my headaches! Avoid this drug at all costs!!"
3/1/2021 5:27:29 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,this is the only thing that helps my migraines so it’s great for that but luckily i don’t get migraines all the time because aleve does have side effects. this time i had to have the max 24 dosage of 12 hour aleve. i had never taken 3 pills in 24 hours before. ugh. GI symptoms! all of them. it’s like the GI symptom buffet. the migraine is gone thank god but i can’t go back to normal activity yet until my gut calms down. first constipation and then sporadic diarrhea plus bloating and a bit of stomach pain. but way better than a migraine. i discovered aleve after i sprained my ankle 12 years ago and it took down the pain and swelling like magic! i had thought my weekend was ruined but it wasn’t. so then i tried it for migraines. i don’t know if the more times you take it the more side effects you have because that first time i had no side effects.
2/12/2021 8:03:53 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Pain Report ,"I worked a 12 hour day painting for a last minute project and woke up the next day entirely sore. I had not taken Aleve in a long time and the bottle dmsaid you could take 2 as your very first dose (which I did) and then 1 more after I hours (which I did before bed). I did not experience any particularly noticeable pain relief. I woke up the next more and my stomach was in pain which I thought was due to gassiness and I farted. Turns out it was diarrhea. Yes folks, this happened in my bed. I threw away the bottle of Aleve right away and haven't touched it since. It is now day 3 and I still have had zero relief as far as the diarrhea goes. I have been eating very lightly (bananas, saltines, and some squash soup) and then have to suffer for 3 hours as my body slowly purges every last bit of it. I see no end in sight and intend on seeing a doctor soon if this doesn't improve. I have no other symptoms other than the chronic diarrhea (not even nausea) so I know I am not sick with something else. Wish me luck folks! And be careful with this drug. If you notice gastrointestinal issues upon taking this drug, you're not crazy and you're not alone."

It does make me sleepy, but I welcome fatigue over the pain."

It was getting progressively more difficult to get up from sitting or lying in bed and pain had nearly sent me to a specialist. I'm 68 and have always been active, take calcium and glucosamine supplements. I searched the internet for other people who felt like this drug had cured them. Sounds crazy but we'll see. 28 hours since the first 200mg. tablet. If after I jog or play pickleball we'll see if the ""cure"" lasts."

11/23/2020 6:44:17 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Acute Gout Report ,"Had bad very migraine and neck tension. Dr recommended Naproxin or aleve. I was under the gun at work so took a few every 4 hours that day. Went home felt like hole in stomach, gnawing and pain radiating to my lower back. A combination of feeling being punched in the stomach and insides bleeding. When I eat pain is triggered back. It's been one week and still pain comes and goes after I eat. Like the naproxen made a hole in my stomach. My stomach is swollen. I cant sleep at night when it starts to hurt. I wish I didn't take it. And I do remember this happened to me 10 years ago when I took it but wasnt sure the Naproxin was the cause. Yeah then found this site and confirmed this pain was the naproxen. Don't take unless you want destroy stomach lining or pancreas and kidney or liver because that's how it feels."

10/15/2020 4:46:36 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Pain Report ,"I was prescribed naproxen earlier this week as I have sprained my groin and pelvic muscles running. I took only two 500mg doses as directed after a meal, on Monday this week. I woke early hours Tuesday morning with uncomfortable pain in my stomach that I can only describe as hunger pangs and gurgling. Since then the pains seem to have gotten worse and more constant. I have not taken naproxen since Monday, now early hours Thursday morning I am still in pain. Is it likely two doses of naproxen will have caused this? The naproxen did not even help with my groin sprain, wish I never took this nasty tablet :("

I caved in and took just 1 dose 500mg Teva-Naproxen after almost a year. I guess I forgot how painful taking this medication is. Why didn't I throw this out months ago?!! NEVER AGAIN! My stomach bloated and burned. My chest hurt. In one hour I was in and and out of the washroom 3x hoping everything inside would flush out and I would have relief. To say I was uncomfortable was an understatement. If it wasn't for Covid, I'd have gone to the hospital. I went to bed last night with a hot water bottle on my upper stomach to soothe and calm the pain so I could sleep. DO NOT TAKE THIS STUFF. THROW IT AWAY! Doctor's shouldn't be prescribing this at all. If your doctor prescribes it, tear up the prescription and look for other alternatives to help with your pain."

7/18/2020 6:53:25 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Dysmenorrhea Report ,"In my experience, it was actually not as fast acting as I’ve heard it to be (took 2-3 hours to kick in, sometimes more). However it was effective at relieving cramps once it kicked in, but not more than ibuprofen. I haven’t experienced any side effects and I’ve been taking the 500mg tablet two times a day each first & second day of the period for about a year now. Overall not bad, but not necessarily better than ibuprofen so I will be switching."
7/17/2020 10:56:06 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Rheumatoid Arthritis Report ,I can live my life. The pain is still there depending on how active I am. I can understand the complaints about stomach upsets but I take Omeprazole half hour before and I eat a big breakfast. My GP warned me to do this. Naproxen needs something to chew on. Its only been two weeks but I’m very optimistic. I’ve been able to stop Co Dydramol.
7/13/2020 10:45:15 AM,2 Stars,Rated  for Pain Report ,"I have previously taken Naproxen for back pain and while it helped a bit, it was not worth the stomach pain it caused. Now I am taking it for period pain and the past two days SINCE I STOPPED TAKING IT I am still feeling unbelievably sick. I barely slept because I kept waking up to extreme stomach pain.

I took naproxen for nearly 5 years for bad period pains it worked amazing and I could actually get on with my day without being confined to my bed with period pains. One night I took 1 tablet before bed and I woke in the night with excruciating chest pain it felt as if something was inside my chest trying to push its way out. The next day I also had burning pain in my upper stomach the doctor thought it was a stomach ulcer. Ever since then I can’t eat the food I used to it has damaged my stomach lining and I am still suffering a year later! Please. Don’t use this drug I have lost 2 stone in weight it is a terrible drug.

Well turns out its Naproxen that is making me feel this way. It's been 9 days since I stopped and I still feel sick with all the side effects.

I increased my Omeprazole because I half expected some symptoms. The Dr told me I could back off to one per day. I managed 2 days of that an am having a full blown flare. Diarrhea, dizziness, abdominal pain and burning. I am done with this medication. ANYONE who has a sensitive stomach, Ulcers, Gastritis etc needs to steer clear!"

Last year he went to his doctors complaining of arthritis and was given naproxen, that was in November 2019 , he went to his doctor complaining of other symptoms but was ignored, January 18th he had an heart attack and had to have two stents fitted , I researched naproxen and they have a black box warning in the USA and they can cause heart attacks and adverse heart problems , my husband was taken straight off of these horrible drugs though the damage is done and has damaged his heart.

The diagnosis was chest wall pain, likely due to inflammation from a cold. It's going on 11pm. I got home from the ER around 6:30pm, and I've had watery diarrhea maybe a dozen or so times in the past 3 hours. Reading the other reviews prompted me to substantiate the claims with my experience.

1/10/2020 4:03:15 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Dysmenorrhea Report ,"Absolutely dreadful drug. I was prescribed the enteric-coated tablet (500mg) which is a whopper of a size to swallow whole. It only starts to break down once it reaches the intestine, but unfortunately, I still experienced all the weird stomach aches and diarrhoea. Definitely upset my system. Way too easy for a GP (UK) to write this prescription drug, without warning of the painful side effects, so in hindsight, I’d never have taken it if I’d known."

I had took 1 dose a day for 2days, f*** me I feel like I am being stabbed repeatedly under my breastbone, that's only after 2 tablets. 4 days on and pain is not going away. Naproxen is a horrific medication that gives you more pain than you already have. Have been witness to people losing there stomach because of naproxen.

Have used it for osteoarthritis in the knees and is the only thing that will relieve the pain. Paracetamol and ibuprofen do nothing. Recently suffered a cracked rib and as I am taking blood pressure med doctor told me not to take naproxen. The described codeine has done nothing so I stopped the blood pressure med for a couple of days and took naproxen which fixed the rib pain straightaway. Never had any ill effects.

I then had the diazepam as directed in the evening, and I woke a few hours later with the most unbearable stomach pain. So unbearable that the diazepam didn’t make any difference to that. I’ve been to the GP who believes the Naproxen has corroded my stomach lining.

I stayed in emergency for 7 hours with nausea and was given endone and a numbing drink to try and alleviate the pain but that still didn’t help. In the end, blood tests revealed I had acute pancreatitis from Naproxen, a rare side effect. I’m still recovering 10 days later. I will never touch this drug again. Ibuprofen and paracetamol have always been fine for me. Read the long list of side effects first!!!"

I ended up worrying about low blood sugar too much because of the ph in some waters, ate too much, and vomited all over the place. I never had this much anxiety in a very long time! I definitely would NOT recommend this medicine, especially for migraines like I have. It caused me to be extra hungry and thirsty at the same time which had also caused me to worry about low blood sugar. I want off this medication!"

I went to the hospital and was admitted with vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) the doctors estimate it will take me 3 weeks to recover from this. This has been the worst illness I’ve ever had. Do not take this!

I've spoken to quite a few people who've tried it and most had the same experience. Happily I haven't had any of the side-effects listed here and I don't think anyone else I spoke to has either but since reading the possible complications and the fact it doesn't work on an on going basis for me anyways, it's not worth the risk since my mother died of kidney disease and I'd much rather not take the chance.

Naproxen generally sorts this pain right out, it is fast acting and for the first 6 months of taking it (only during the first and second days of my period) completely got rid of the pain. The last month or two that I have been taking it I have noticed a dull ache in my lower back despite having taken Naproxen but this generally goes away after a few hours. All in all it has helped me hugely and my periods are never a problem as long as I keep them with me. Would 100% recommend for anyone struggling with Dysmenorrhea!"

9/2/2016 4:43:32 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Osteoarthritis Report ,"Been on this for many years on & off, I only take as needed. I have degetive disc disease since I was 15 (mid 30's now) form an biking accident, 2 herniated L4/L5 disc, had surgery on them 15 years ago (helped a lot with siatica but did not eliminate it). Hit by a car once and 3 other bad bicycle accidents. I take Tylenol, Vicodin & Valium all as needed besides naproxen, also take other daily meds for a gland problem that I will die with out them The bads; YOU MUST EAT before taking, eat reasonable amount a food, a bit of bread will not cut it, eat the full slice of bread or tall glass of whole milk. It takes at lease a hour while for it to START to work. Pros: it does help if taken right for the right pain, it will not get rid of mussel spasms. It does help when you inflammatory problems or swelling like in knee or week right after you brake a bone (yes it helped with the swelling in my foot right after on top a Vicodin) This has cut my use of Vicodin in half or greater, I take this maybe 4 times a week, Vicodin maybe 3-8 times a month (fall & spring the worse months for me) before napexson I was taking 6-10+ Vicodin a month. This is not some magic pill it a help,"

If you follow the dosing instructions, there shouldn't be a problem. It usually says to not exceed 3 tablets in a 24 hour period. That means every 12 hours you alternate between 2 tablets and 1 tablet, or you could take 1 tablet every 8 hours. I usually use the former configuration, and it works way better for me than acetaminophen. I usually buy the largest quantity bottle I can find, and since I only use it 12 weeks out of the year, that averages about $24 a year give or take a few bucks."

Now, it seems as if my JRA has came back; so I have just recently been put back on Naproxen. Most likely, it was the methotrexate that didn't work.

Two weeks of 250 mg per day did give some relief, as if my knee joints and myalgic muscles had been given a spray of WD40. Then, as advised I could, I increased my dose to 500 mg per day. This, after three days, has made a significant difference to background discomfort and pain generally, although my muscles still hurt when under load, e.g. standing up.

Colchicine eventually worked somewhat, at the expense of my GI tract.

We are still unsure of the cause as there is no inflammation and my x-rays and bloodwork checking for rheumatoid came back normal. Not only am I frustrated with this mystery joint pain, it is equally as frustrating being prescribed this medication, as it doesn't even touch the pain that I am in. The only benefit I believe is that the side effects distract me a tad from the pain. Because the side effects are horrendous.
