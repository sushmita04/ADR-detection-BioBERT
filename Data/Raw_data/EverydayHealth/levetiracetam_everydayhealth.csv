6/21/2021 3:15:21 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"Never let anyone you love take this horrible drug. I had nearly two months of paranoid hallucinations, anxiety, major weight loss (from 185 lbs to 142 lbs - 63 y.o. male). Stopped it abruptly and I was fine the next day and ever after."
4/20/2021 7:39:00 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"I've had 3 seizures over 10 years (grand mal) and was prescribed this after the first one. This medication completely changed me. I got full on Keppra-rage to start with and on top of not being able to drive, I was horrible to everyone who tried to help. I then got EXTREMELY bad suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety. I tried to ask my neurologist for help, but he kept telling me ""keppra is the best on the market"". My personality changed, my appetite changed, I lost all motivation, I was tired all the time and constantly had headaches. I just recently went off Keppra due to not being able to stand the suicidal thoughts anymore and after a month I am finally starting to feel like myself again after years. I truly hope other people's experiences are better than mine. I wish I would have gone off Keppra sooner."

3/18/2021 1:58:31 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"I think Keppra is a good medication since it's fulfills it's purpose of stopping or improving seizures in most people. My only advice is, be cautious with your dosing and listen to your body. There are certainly side effects, some go away after a while. Some don't. Keppra is a bitter sweet medicine. Always be sure to give the medication time to truly determine how it affects you long term. Dose adjustments can always be made. All I know is... There are way worse medications out there. So if Keppra works for you, be happy with it. Find alternative ways to manage mild side effects if you can."
2/23/2021 10:08:04 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,I took keppra for partial and grand mal seizures 11 years ago. It was the worst medication I had ever taken in my life. I experienced all the side effects including the rare ones. I had dropped 30 lbs in 30 days because I couldn't make myself eat and I had no appetite whatsoever. I was only 125 to start with at 5'2. It seemed like forever before I gained it back. Alot of time it seemed like I was incapable of focus. I had to take 1 month leave of absence from work and it wasn't enough I should have taken 3. Eventually things started to get a little better but then it was like a roller coaster. It got to the point to where I just couldn't take it anymore and was prescribed something else. It worked great with partial seizures not so much with grand mal seizures.
2/19/2021 11:48:00 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Partial Seizures Report ,"I think from what I am reading other reviews is that you have to gauge what the correct dose is for you and lower the dose till you find a safe zone. I got down to 250mg a day, starting in the morning. It sets the tone for the day that way. Though I only have partial that can evolve to grand mal. Some are worse off obviously, with full time grand mals. No one knows you better than yourself, read the literature, YouTube videos, and become and expert on your condition. Also, use additional levers like diet, meditation, and other meds for bad days to support, like benzos for Breakthru days. The reality, is your brain is now unstable, so you have to treat it like an egg. You have to change your life, and you have to be highly aware of the rhythm of your thoughts. All easier said than done in our current digital hurry up world."
2/14/2021 9:59:10 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Extremely effective for complex partial seizures, but the side effects are too crazy. I'll have days where everything I'm too exhausted to do anything and others where I have too much energy to focus. The exhaustion is unbearable in the winter season. If you're experiencing the exhausted symptoms, I recommend playing a rhythm-based game. IDK why, but it helps alleviate the blah feelings."
2/2/2021 12:01:53 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"I take Keppra XR 500 mg at night. I've been on it for about 6 years now for mild partial seizures, likely originating in my temporal lobe. I like Keppra because I never noticed much as far as initial side effects with it other than maybe some mild dizziness the first few days of being on it. Over the years though, I have noticed that I've become somewhat forgetful and have a general lack of energy/lack of motivation when I didn't used to but it's hard to determine whether that's from the Keppra or my other medical issues (I suffer from fibromyalgia as well). I have not noticed any seizures since being on it."
1/15/2021 6:54:53 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"I was diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy when i was 14. i am now 20. i took lamotrigine at first and it kept me from having grand mal seizures but i still had myoclonic jerks. so they put me on keppra too ( i take 500mg in the morning and 1000mg at night & i take 300 mg of lamotrigine every 12 hours) and it’s been working perfectly fine. i’ve had seizures every now and then but that’s because sometimes i don’t get enough sleep because of school/work. keppra changed me completely. it was weird because the side effects really hit me when i was around 17/18. i asked my doctor if that was possible and he said yes. he said the side effects can hit you whenever. i was so depressed, i didn’t feel like doing anything, my mood swings were and still are pretty rough, i get super nauseous too. i lose my appetite sometimes and it just sucks. the list goes on. i’ve tried other medications and the only one that really stops my seizures is keppra so i can’t get off it. i recommend anything but keppra but if it’s the only thing that works for you i guess your stuck taking it like me."
11/30/2020 3:55:44 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,I have been taking Keppra since I started having seizures in 2012 from a brain injury. It has worked for the most part but I still have mini seizures all the time. I take 1500 mg. Of it twice daily
10/16/2020 7:37:18 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"I developed focal seizures as a result of having a brain tumor. Before removing the tumor, I’d tried lamictal, zonisamide, and gabapentin without success. They put me on keppra post-tumor removal as prophylaxis. Either the tumor removal or the keppra stopped the seizures so I don’t really know. Likely the removal of the tumor along with time for edema to settle was the real reason. Either way, keppra had way fewer side effects at 1000mg BID than zonisamide (200mg BID) or lamictal (300mg BID). Only pitfall was that after weaning off the drug 2-yrs later, tinnitus came on strong. Occurred exactly 2 days after my last dose."
9/3/2020 10:08:34 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"I took Keppra for about 5 months. In those 5 months I became a new person and it wasn’t good. Keppra caused my personality to change completely, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and headaches. The only good about it was it did prevent seizures. I would’ve never even put it into my body if I knew how bad the side effects were. I would just be very cautious when taking this medication!"
8/15/2020 5:17:24 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"Keppra has generated horrible sude affects with me. Increased anger/irritability, nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain near the kidneys, depression, lack of appetite, sadness, laziness/fatigue, loss of concentration. Taking 500 mg every 12 hours."
7/29/2020 1:23:14 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,My husband has been taking 500 mg twice a day for a yer now. He sleeps 18 hrs out of 24 hrs. Personality has changed dramaticlly and not for the better. Never wants to leave the house. Not interested in anything. this medication sucks big time.
7/28/2020 9:30:06 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,I’ve been on Keppra since 2014 after being on clonazepam at first when I had my first seizure aged 12. Both meds stopped my seizures but they took me off clonazepam as it is addictive & can’t be taken when pregnant. Keppra is a safe drug and has been very effective. I’ve noticed since being on it that I am more tired easily and very heavy eyed. Other than that I’ve been ok. Occasional anxiety & feelings of being low but I blame hormones for that. I take 250mg 2x daily and will do so for as long as possible - anything to not have a seizure in my eyes.
6/24/2020 3:45:16 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,I became very emotional and depressed. Fatigue overtook me and I seriously thought I was dying. I had blurry vision every single day and lighting bothered me . I seen doctor after doctor thinking that the diagnosis was wrong not realizing it was the drug the entire time. It was not until I switch from Mercy Health to the Cleveland Clinic that it was discovered what the problem really was. I will also say when I told my doctor my symptoms instead of realizing it was a side effect he increase my dosage which increased my side effects.
6/19/2020 1:49:25 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"I started taking keppra 3 months ago and I'm seizure free since I started taking 750mg twice daily. A lot of people are talking about different side effects but these side effects are on the leaflet. Lately I've been getting irritated very easily and aggressive behaviour but at the same time I haven't been eating and exercising a balanced diet so that could be a cause either ?????A lot is down to your GP and you, if you get depression or anything consult your GP if you are not happy with the medication try a other. Last year I was on epilim 500 mg twice daily I had multiple seizures last year but I was also binge drinking a lot but since I've started drinking in moderation maybe a few bottles here and there it quenches the urge to binge again so u found alcohol to have a devastating effect on it with me"
5/21/2020 6:31:22 PM,2 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"My son was put on keppra a little over a month ago. They started him on a schedule where he worked up to 6ml bid. He started getting longer absence seizures, his brain is so foggy he couldn't even do simple addition yesterday, he has severe leg weakness at times that makes it so he can't walk, he cries at the drop if a hat, he has become impulsive, and aggressive. After his video EEG we are taking him off it ASAP."
4/8/2020 10:58:19 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,More effective than my lamotrigine on its own has ever been at stopping seizures (had 3 grand mal ones before and after taking keppra) and only had myoclonic seizures if I missed a dose. However it also caused depressive and anxiety episodes and lead to self harm and suicidal ideation
1/7/2020 8:38:51 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"I have been on Keppra for 10 years. I take 250 mg daily. I used to be on 500 mg twice a day. Being on social security disability and medicare, I can't afford to see a dentist to correct the damage this medicine has done. I grind my teeth while I am asleep. Even a mouthguard I bought doesn't help. I developed a TMJ disorder from all the grinding I have done. I broke two bottom molars, down to the root. I can no longer chew. I am trying to save money so I can get my teeth fixed/pulled. This medicine has kept me seizure free, but the side effects are devastating. Besides breaking my teeth, I feel tired all the time, wake up with a sore jaw, severe anxiety, experience heart palpitations, facial rash, mouth sores, dizziness, lightheadedness. This medication negatively affects your quality of life."
1/3/2020 4:11:46 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Worst drug ever in my opinion!!! Simply does nothing but make my condition worse. Here were my side effects- irritability, paranoia, anxiety, generally feeling very sick like nausea, loss of appetite, numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, it would make my aura seizures come more often than they normally would without medication, cause me to feel dizzy and light headed most of the time, and in particular, and the dizziness and light headed down feeling would worsen a great deal during an aura seizure and same with the paranoia feeling, which does not happen normally if I was not on medication. When I started to get numbness and tingling, it would be so bad and scary that I admitted myself to hospital a few times! And even the doctors didn’t say it was from my medication, well how else did this stop right after I stopped the medication? It would also cause me to get aura seizures when I was still asleep and it would wake me up! It would also make my aura seizures feel much worse. It would make me feel suicidal at times as well. I took the medication for about six months and have had more than enough of it. I at one stage was taking one tablet twice a day then even two tablets"
12/28/2019 2:57:07 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Been on 1500 mg twice daily for complex partial seizures. At first I was worried about reported side effects, fortunately I have responded very well to the drug and have had no seizures. I also take 150 mg Lamictal twice a day."
12/16/2019 4:33:09 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Tonic-clonic Seizures Report ,"I was diagnosed with focal epilepsy around five years ago and was put on Tegretol 200mg to control my seizures. In 2017 I went into convulsive status epilepticus so it was decided by my doctors that I must take Tegretol CR 200mg and Keppra 500mg twice daily. It has been over two years now since commencing Keppra and I have had no seizures. When I first started Keppra, I noticed a number of side effects such as experiencing vivid dreams at night, mood swings, teeth grinding, confused thinking, fatigue, frequent headaches, poor memory and concentration. I think my confused thinking and headaches are linked with the vivid dreams impacting on my sleep quality. Taking melatonin and magnesium seems to have improved my sleep quality. In the morning I have started having a Vitamin B active complex and Vitamin D3 supplements with breakfast which helps with my fatigue. I read that Vitamin B6 P5P form can help reduce some of the adverse effects of Keppra so it made sense to try it."
12/1/2019 1:52:27 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"I note that reviews of Keppra range from extremely negative to positive. Something weird is going on with this drug. My experience was the horrible dark toxic type described below. Again, this drug apparently works for some, but definitely not for me. It didn't affect my seizure rate at all (BTW this rate was about a every 2 h non-stop night & day and now - after being at the end of my tether - this is just partly under control with Eplim, while I'm still reducing Keppra to zero asap). The worse thing was that some of the side-effects of the drug (or what I think now were side effects, including confused thinking, sore eyes, feeling hot, flushed face, feeling angry, heart racing, brain pounding) were easy to get confused with some of the worst effects of my condition, so the doctors attributed them to the condition not the drug - so I was prescribed just more of the same drug. I took 2.5 g/day at the height of it - a downward spiral into hell. At that point I was at breaking point, now at 1 g/day I can sort of cope. Good luck to all."

11/17/2019 12:13:31 PM,2 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Keppra stopped my complex partial seizures completely, but the side effects are terrible. I lost many friends when I was getting adjusted to Keppra; I would have massive mood swings of pure rage for no reason. In college (I was diagnosed sophomore year) I began to struggle paying attention to class and my grades were tanking. For these past years, I have been facing depression, anxiety attacks, and constant fatigue. I don't ever feel happy like I used to. Out of the many medicines I've been on, Keppra is the only one that has worked for me. If you have other options, I would recommend not taking Keppra."
10/12/2019 12:09:27 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Currently weening our son off Keppra. It worked for 2 weeks. He’s now had 4 seizures in 1 week (more than he ever had unmedicated, had 1 every month or 2 without meds). He started out on 500mg 2x day. Doctor moved him up to 750mg 2x a day. Now that he’s had 4 break through seizures in a week, we have to assume it’s just not working. It also completely changed his personality. He’s sad, apathetic, foggy headed, losing short term memory sharpness, can’t focus and is losing his appetite. He also gets angry very easily now over very small things that normally wouldn’t bother him. His grades dropped dramatically in the 3 weeks he’s been on it. Hoping his new medicine actually controls his seizures (focal) and doesn’t have the same drastic side effects."

No more seizures, and no side effects. It's not instant though, it did take a couple of weeks before it started to do its job and the side effects subsided."
2/26/2019 5:58:39 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"This is an update to my review posted on this website on 9/21/18. I initially rated Keppra ""one star"". On Nov 8, 2018, my neuro doc reduced my dosage from 500mg twice daily, to 250mg twice daily for two weeks, then 250mg daily, and then stopped completely on Dec 8, 2018. Everything was going great for 6 weeks then I had my second seizure in my life on 1/24/19; went to ER, got me stabilized, and now I am on 500mg twice daily for ""some time"". My seizures are resulting from the 8/10/18 traumatic C-3 & C-4 nondisplaced fractures suffered in a fall. I have had zero side effects from Keppra...no moodiness, no depression. I don't want to go through another seizure and trip to the ER so if Keppra will stop that, then I'll give the drug four stars. Of course, I don't want to take the drug because of possible unknown side effects, but I don't have a good alternative...either seizures or take Keppra. Does anyone know if there has been a long term study of Keppra side effects? If yes, please post the website that contains the study."

The Keppra has helped with her grand maul seizures, but recently she has been having more and more prolonged focal seizures. She has also been struggling with depression. She has been seeing a therapist and is on anti-depressants. Recently someone posted about depression being linked to this drug and I never put two and two together. We have since switched her to another medication. I'm hoping her mood improves as well as her seizures."

Dr could diagnose the reason of the seizures, did every test and everything came back normal. I have been taking Keppra for almost 2 weeks now. I take 750mg every 12 hours. I will say the only good thing about it is that I have not had another seizure while taking it, BUT, I am going back to Dr in a few days to ask to be taken off of this med. In my personal experience I have had the worst side effects from it. I have had the worst mood swings and bad feelings I have ever had, depressed feelings, no appetite at all, very irritable, I have done nothing but argue and be angry with all of my family and I have never had problems like this until taking this med. My memory has not been the same since the seizures, not sure if that's from the meds or just a very long lasting effect from the seizures itself. I just feel anger and aggravation from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. I absolutely can not wait to be taken off of this medicine I hate it!"

A few months ago, I had to change doctors and this one indicated to me the Keppra 400mg saying that would be a drug more efficient for my case. It was the worst thing I did. I was hospitalized for four days with severe arm and leg pains, doctors did not know what to do, they thought I was having a heart attack! Until on the fifth day in the hospital they took out the Keppra and started to improve. From that day I swore I would never take this medicine again.

After starting it, the depression and anxiety lessened, but rage, irritation and... sexual desire had increased greatly. I was a monster, lashing out at anyone who caused me a minor inconvenience. I scared away my friends and love interest. My psychiatrist decided to stop me cold turkey instead of weaning me off of it after noticing how severe the symptoms were. Hell, I yelled at him when he asked how I was doing. Now that I'm off of it, I'm much more settled down and my anger and ""desires"" are under control again. I have a different med in its place. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody... at least, not for those who take it for anxiety and depression. It will change you, and not in a positive way."

After about two weeks I had red spots all over my face, I would talk like a drunk person, I was upset about everything, I never felt like going to the grocery store or seeing friends and family.

My father was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had it surgically removed, they couldn't remove it in certain areas and we were told it was cancerous, stage 4. My father never had history of seizures and was put on an extremely high dose of Kepra. Since then he acts like a zombie, can hardly talk, cannot control his urine, it is absolutely a sad sight. He never had history of seizure and now if we were to cut off his doses he would initially have a seizure, what kind of fucking treatment is that?? We have been steadily decreasing the ml and he is having mild symptoms of stroke. Half his body is going numb, face is drooping and can hardly walk normally.

Keppra works for me as long as I take it.

I tried every other migraine med before they finally conducted an EEG that determined seizure activity, so if you experience frequent migraines, request an EEG. Those other meds never helped with the migraines, but I started with 250mg gen keppra and halved my migraines. It made me drowsy, so I take it at night. I've increased to 500, then 750, both the latter on ER (extended release) formula, and I rarely experience an episode. I personally feel like my mind is clearer and better focused on this med. I've read some feel cloudy, but that's never been my experience on keppra--only on the other meds.

I had a brain haemorrhage six years ago, and after that had a seizure as I was taking the Thanksgiving turkey out of the oven, so I was given Keppra and have taken it ever since. I guess it works, although once I had another seizure and had to go to the ER, where they upped my dosage to 500 mg twice a day. I guess it works because I haven't had any more seizures, but I do have many of the side effects -- depression, anxiety, thoughts of suicide (although I would never do that) etc. I thought it was just me, but perhaps it's the drug? I find it difficult sometimes to find the word I'm looking for and have to stop speaking for a minute while I search for it.

9/1/2016 9:12:42 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Seizures Report ,"At 54 I started having tonic-clonic seizures - like fainting. At first my physician prescribed phenytoin (Dilantin) - it worked, but I was zoned out and groggy. After about a year I was switched to levetiracetam (generic Keppra). For about the first year it was pretty good - was able to work with my doctor to find the minimal dosage to resolve my problems (I take one 750mg pill a day - 1/2 of it in AM, 1/2 in PM). This is a low dose overall. Over time, I started developing anger and moodyness issues (google Keppra Rage) and developed ever increasing memory loss issues - particularly short term memory. I've tried B6, B12, D3 - it may help, but it's not enough. My doctor is switching me to lamotrigine (generic Lamictal) - we'll see how that goes. Right now I'm taking both (slowly increasing Lamictal while still on Keppra) and I'm a total bastard at times. I so feel for my spouse... I truly hope that the issues subside after going onto Lamictal only. The plus side, however is that keppra truly does work to prevent seizures - it might just be the only drug for your issue - just work with your doctor to find the right dosage - and be aware of the side effects."

I would talk about how I wanted to die, lay in bed all day, lash out at loved ones, cry constantly. My neurologist put me on the brand name keppra because he said the binding agents within the generic can exaserbate potential side effects significantly. After switching to the brand name, all of those emotional problems diminished. I have had brand name medically necessary on my precriptions ever since. Twice I tried going back to the generic version of this drug and got the same insane personality back again both times. Looking back, I think perhaps the brand name may have made me more tired and reckless at times... or not, its tough to say because I've been on it so long. I do know that if brand name Keppra has given me any side effects that they're not nearly as bad as the side effects from the generic version. While some people obviously might have negative reactions to both versions of this medication, I think it's extremely important for people to know that the emotional issues and negative, depressive, and/or suicidal thoughts CAN be due to the fact that you need to try the brand name if you are currently taking the g"

5/12/2016 12:58:58 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Keppra was awful. It was the first drug I took when I was diagnosed with epilepsy, and it completely destroyed my mental health. The side effects were awful. These mostly include severe anxiety and depression. Almost immediately after taking this drug, I felt as though I never wanted to get out of bed. I began panicking and getting overwhelmed by far-fetched thoughts and stresses in life. I had dreams where I committed suicide, my new-onset stress and anxiety held me back from going out and socializing, and made me contemplate my own life. Being an otherwise mentally healthy person, I was extremely concerned by these symptoms that I had no control over, and knew it had to be a side effect of the drug. I told my neurologist and I immediately changed to 150mg of LamoTriGine (Lamictal), which works wonders. Prevents my epileptic seizures and is also used as a mood stabilizer so I'm sure that's why mental side-effects don't exist with the new drug. Avoid Keppra.

It made a huge difference. My side effects cut in half (no more tingly chills/ goosebumps all over my legs and not so ditsy) and I felt much more confident. I still experience the lethargic feelings. Do I exist? What if this person had never met, would I still exist? I would but not to them.... These thoughts would flash through my mind so fast and intensely that I wasn't entirely aware of what was happening because as soon as it ended I couldn't remember. Like waking from a dream and having it at the tip of your mind but the more you wake up the more it fades. It happened enough times that I started remembering what the thoughts were. Weird. Overall the drug stopped my seizures. I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's suicidal because the thought of death (not the act of killing one self) but the thought of ""what if I die?"" enters my mind frequently now. I don't struggle with those types of problem so it's more of a curious thing for me and at the very least, inspired me to write up a will. Just in case."

Be careful not to believe unbelievable ratings. You never know who works for companies, and some of the ratings may be put there as subliminal advertising. This is a balancing decision - whether you are prepared to tolerate the drugs side effects, or suffer seizures. It is awful and just awful for people who you are living with too. Everyone needs to read about what to expect from being on Keppra. There are vitamins that help relieve them - B12, and something called Ex-Stress, but it will be hard to live with. Nothing in life doesn't have a price to pay for the good it does, but it still works better than any other drug I have ever been prescribed, so I will carry on taking it, even though there will be more tears and anxiety than I used to have to live with. God bless you, whoever you are.I take 2 500mg tablets morning and night and have been on Keppra with Lamotrigine for 2 months now."

It takes a few weeks until the moods and anxiety get dreadful to cope with. Extreme depression and tearfullness get worse each day. It is bad for people who live in the same house, and provokes arguments and emotional distress. Keppra makes you very tired, even falling asleep approximately 5 hours after taking it. By the time the side effects become very bad, you have got used to not having seizures and it would be awful to choose between going through the side effects, and going through the seizures. I have chosen to tolerate the side effects, but the miracle of the drug stopping the seizures is not there any longer. Generally difficult to balance but take vitamin B12 and it relieves side effects quite well. Good luck to anyone suffering, hope your families will understand your plight."

While on Keppra alone I was driving to work and ran into the back of someone - had a seizures and kept going. I had no idea 10 min after the fact what had happened. The front of my car was bashed in and I had no idea what had happened because I had a full blown complex partial seizure. Had to hire a lawyer so I would not be given a ticket for Hit & Run.

The last time in with his dr. he added 100 mg in am and pm. Totally a different person - himself. Yes he still feels tired at times but thats the trade off. When he was on Keppra by itself he would cry for no reason. Very Emotional. Vimpat changed all that. We also went to Emory in Atlanta and they agreed Vimpat was a good choice. I am hoping we can reduce the mg of Keppra and keep Vimpat. That will be our next question to dr. If you don't have insurance Vimpat is very expensive. But worth every penny.

I feel so ""alive"" and ""alert"". The negative side effects to Keppra are shakiness (have to hold a cup with 2 hands while taking a drink), Short temper (I have always been a very mild-tempered person), Opinionated (I have an opinion about everything now), Insomnia, and a more aggressive behavior. The side effects have caused a ""depressed"" feeling. I sometimes feel ""evil-thoughts"" are associated with this medicine. I have had no grand mal seizures on this medication."

Well, Keppra was better but it caused a whole new array of problems. While it gave me my short-term memory back and put a halt to the eye pain and insomnia I had experienced on Topamax, it made me severely emotional. I had read about the ""Kepprages"" but I also read that taking B-6 would counteract these affects. They didn't. I would get angry to the point where I would break things (that's not me at all). I literally would feel my blood boil. If I wasn't severely angry, then I was depressed. I have always been in and out of depression my whole life and I understand that's just one of the joys of living with epilepsy. But the depression I felt on Keppra was like ten times worse that anything I had experienced. I was suicidal, I experienced lows that I had never experienced before. There was no reason in my mind. I'm glad I'm off it now."

I was on Lamictal for the first few years and I became moody and angry and on top of that was getting rashes instantly after taking my medication.

I had been on Carbamazipine and Ethosuximide for years and was stable. After the birth of my son i decided to try other medications. I was first introduced to Lamotrigine and the side effects were awful. At this stage i was then introduced to Keppra and was told to remain on the full dosage of the other medication until i reached 1500mg Keppra. I have never been so ill. It is difficult to state what the effects from the Keppra and the interactions. After struggling to reach the required 1500mg i became very ill. It started with a sore throat and an inability to move. I lost two stone in two weeks. Now the middle of summer light began to hurt my eyes. After going to the doctor to discuss my meds and drop the Lamotrigin i started developing blisters all over. I went straight back to the doctor and diagnosed Polymorphic light eruption. The blisters then turned into Psorisis - i was in crisis. I insisted on dropping all the lamotrogine also carbamazipine and bringing ethosuximide to a minimum dose. My doctor agreed this was the best way forward as we needed to alliminate side effects through trial. When i eventually got to 1500mg and 250mg Ethosuximide it was decided the Keppra was above my tolerence. I have since moved down to 1250mg a day. My control is still not as stable as when i was on the Carbamazipine and Ethosuximide but if you dont try these things you will never know. My side effects from the Keppra are lack of motivation. Tired. Pins and needles especially in the evening when my meds are due. It is a finicky drug. It requires scheduled times not just morning and night. You cannot have so much as a sip of Alcohol as you feel effects immediatly. At least with the others i could have a glass of wine on a special occasion.

I began on Tegretol two years ago, this made me a zombie, but I had not seizures. I switched to Keppra 500 mg twice a day, the first months it was great I actually had energy and was no longer a walking zombie, this no doubt from being off the Tegretol. Than I began to become anxious, aggressive,and a feeling like my world was falling in. I became overwhelmed with the smallest problem and felt like I could not deal with every day life. This was not me, I am a ""fixer"", I do not run from a fight or problem I plan and execute that plan and ""fix"" life's troubles. I became ineffective in every aspect of my life, and it was a big deal to even sit down and pay my bills! After 6 months on Keppra I starting having the ""auras"" again, so my dose was changed from 1000mg a day to 1250mg a day, I had two gran mal's even on that dose, not to mention a complete emotional breakdown, total despair feeling. I am in the process of getting off Keppra, and just started on Trileptal, have taken first dose last night,this morning I feel nauseaus and very drugged, just like I felt on tegretol. So I do not know where to go from here, there is such a thing as quality of life, that is the most important thing to me, it will do no good to be seizure free if I am psycotic or a zombie. I was only having 4 or so gran mal's per year before I began meds, perhaps I can deal with ghose and not deal with the side effects. All of my seixures over 30 years have been while I was asleep.

He told me I had a ""cyclic mood disorder"" which I came to find out was what he told everyone they had.. I officially have GAD.. Anyways, the first thing I noticed about Keppra was that it made me sleep like crazy! I could fall asleep anywhere at any time of day. It wasn't dangerous as I didn't drive but it kept me from doing anything for a while. Though it was also a blessing of course as I got plenty of rest. Kind of scared me though because I usually wake up if I need to for some reason but this stuff knocked me out so hard that my roommates could do crazy stuff without waking me up (and I have pictures to prove it.) After about a week I noticed that I was starting to do things that I was always too depressed or anxious to do.. Little things like clean my room or fix something that had been broken for months.. So things were looking good. But pretty soon it got to where I was popping a few over the course of the day. The psychiatrist had recommended that to me as I had commented that I started feeling worse later in the day. And after perhaps a month or two it stopped helping me get to sleep. Somewhere around this time it came to my attention that there were serious holes in my short term memory. I had done things that I had no recollection of, even if clues were right in front of me. Nothing bad thankfully but it scared me so bad that I stopped taking it right away."
10/19/2006 6:08:24 PM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"HORRID I have been an epileptic since the age of 13. Varying degrees of seizures - Initially diagnosed as ""Petit Mal"". Have been on Epilim, Topamax, Trileptal, Rivotril and now on Keppra. I have been ""seizure free"" since April 2005. The side-effects of both the Topomax (stupomax as I call it) and Trileptal were (I was on both of them at the same time) unbearable! I underwent EEG Monitoring for 3 days and have now been diagnosed as having ""Primary Generalised Epilepsy"" which is inoperable. So far I find the side-effects of the Keppra to be insomnia,aggression, emotional (overly so),depressive thoughts etc. I have only been on my full dose for 1 month - I hope it gets better.It is now October 2006 and the Keppra turned me into an emotional, weepy, bitchy, suicidal wreck!!!!! I tapered down to 250mg Keppra and 100mg Topamax - Normality reigns!!! This past Monday I suffered a Grand Mal seizure at work. I had missed a dose of the Keppra on Sunday and Monday. I now understand from my neurologist that because I am on such a low threshhold (meds) in order to maintain an even keel in my lifestyle I cannot afford to miss a single dose. Fair deal. Since coming off the high dose of Keppra though I feel much better. If you have any tendencies towards depression - stay clear of Keppra. Believe me I did not see myself as a ""depressed"" person and yes there are other factors to consider such as hormones etc, which I am looking into but be very careful. I have a very supporting husband and great daughter - but there were many days when I would quite happily have taken that rollercoaster ride to nowhere."

I'm already on Tegretol and Neurontin, so I didn't know how many more options I would have before considering VNS. I would suggest Keppra to others."

Had been having petit mals several times a week with GM's every few months in the 18 months prior to going on Keppra. Have been GM-free w/Keppra and minor episodes and fuzzy-mindedness are very well controlled. Have now been seizure-free on Keppra/Lamictal combination for 3 years, mostly on 1500 mg/day & 450 mg/day respectively. My most pronounced side-effect has been a complete loss of a day-to-day biological clock. Some days I sleep 3 hours. Most days I sleep six. Periodically, the sleeplessness catches up and I go for up to 11+ hours. This happens about one out of every nine days. The erratic sleep schedule can interfere with work performance, but seizures are much worse for job-performance. I had been on 3,000 mg per day for 18 months. Keppra did not 'inspire' negative moods or feelings of aggression. However it definitely amplified negative moods originating from other circumstances of life. Doctor switched me to 1500mg/day after feelings of aggression towards a particularly problematic individual started getting serious enough for me to spontaneously seek psychiatric observation. On the lowered dose, I have felt comfortabley in control around this person who I work closely with. Keppra has no effect on my ability to enjoy life with friends nor does it detract from normally pleasant life experiences. It's psychological effect for me is very dependent on the context of my life within several days of present time. Generally, I am very glad to have it. I just wish it were cheaper."

I do not take it in conjunction with any other medications. As far as preventing or lessening the onset of seizures, Keppra has been nearly as effective for me as Zonegran. After six months on Keppra, I experienced two complex partial seizures the same morning - something that had never happened to me. I was more surprised than anything, having been being essentially seizure free on Zonegran and Keppra respectively up to that point. So I'm noting things going forward. At my next follow up visit, I expect the recommendation will be a hike in dosage. Aside from that, I've not experienced noticeable side effects and have been pleased in general. This is my fourth medication in 10 years, so I'm interested in the comparable effectiveness, incidence of side effects, etc. This site has taught me a great deal about the diversity of experiences people have with the same medication, so I strive to carefully observe things I experience.

Try B6 I've only had 3 seizures (except one febrile seizure as an infant), the first one less than a year ago. We're still trying to determine if there's a cause - or even if it might be convulsive syncope. Since I've gone months between seizures, this isn't easy. But, just in case, I've been taking Keppra. And the side effects have been much worse than I anticipated. I've always had an excellent memory, but now I can't remember things, events I was at, words I need, spellings, etc. The mood swings, irritation and rage over small things, and depression have been bad. Tingling and twitching in mouth, lips, fingers, and toes were bad, but as my dosage increased, I began getting sores on my tongue and mouth, especially in the corners of my lips. Dizziness, uncoordination, a feeling like motion sickness or that feeling you get when you read in the car - this is frequent. Sometimes I have no energy - can't make myself get off the couch. I've also suddenly developed an allergy to certain metals - I can't wear my watches anymore, and ibuprofin now gives me a severe rash. It especially makes it hard to put up with, because we don't know yet if the keppra is even doing anything to help me. To help with the depression and mood swings, I started taking Noni. It helped a lot. I no longer had crying fits from frustration and depression every afternoon, and I was able to control the anger at little things. But it didn't help the other side effects. Then I got a tip to try 100 mg of B6. Funny thing, a lot of the side effects I was getting were the same as the symptoms of a B6 deficiency. It took several days, but I have seen an improvement since I started the B6. The sores in my mouth are almost gone, and most of the other symptoms are improved - but not gone. My memory still betrays me, though, and I haven't tested the metal allergy or ibuprofin. My doctor had never heard of using B6. He said it wouldn't hurt, but doubted it"

There has been none of the side effects that I have read about with other peoples experiences with Keppra. I still suffer from occasional depression but I do suffer from clinical depression and even that has improved due in part to the fact that I'm seizure free.

More and more, I felt -everything- was hopeless. I lost my appetite and didn't even care about getting out of bed. I was too zombified to drive, and didn't want to talk to friends or family, who grew increasingly and rightly concerned about me. One night I found myself suddenly not wanting to take a sleeping pill because it would deplete my supply and I thought I shouldn't do that ""just in case"". The thought seemed to come out of nowhere and terrified me so much I burst into tears. I realized I could never do ""that"", hated myself for being ""a coward"", and cried more. Once the depression started, I cried nearly every day I was on Keppra. Since the night I didn't take that sleeping pill, I thought about death every day. The suicidal thoughts and depression went away once I stopped the Keppra. I had hoped if I ""stuck it out"" for a few weeks, maybe 5 weeks, all the horrible side effects would go away... If I could just be strong enough, maybe it would be worth it... I also had consistent ear pain after a couple weeks on Keppra. Soon after stopping the medicine, I found myself with a high fever, a bleeding ear, throwing up. An ear infection, another ""gift"" from Keppra, I believe its third most common side effect."

But then I had one aqain and they put me on KEPPRA. I have no side effects other then my speach impairments and I stay up late. But when I ran out and didnt have time to go get some more, on the second day I had another grand mal and was concious. I can tell when im not on it, I get more pettys. I have only had one small side effect twice, and it was swollen gums. I did allot of due diligence into Keppra and Dilantin and they cause you vitamin levels to be off and taking TOO much of ONE vitamin is not a good idea. I found that the POWER BARS (trademark) ARE IDEAL!!!!!! They give you EXACTLY the right vitamins and the right amount. Since I have taken one a day I can tell. The side effects are DRAMATICALLY LESS and I feel better.

5/13/2006 12:08:34 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Good experience so far I had a single seizure event in January. EFFECTIVENESS: It is difficult for me to rate the ""Effectiveness"" of Keppra because I don't know what life would be like without it (i.e., I don't know if I could have another seizure). Therefore, I have rated the ""Effectiveness"" of Keppra as a ""5"" which is a neutral rating. SIDE EFFECTS: I rated this a ""9"" because, until recently, I haven't suffered from any of the documented side effects. Perhaps my dosage is low enough to not see side effects at all or right away or perhaps I need to be on the drug longer or perhaps I'm lucky to have found an anti-seizure drug which works for me. I was originally on Dilantin, which I ended up being allergic to, then I was moved to Trileptal which I ended up being allergic to. Fingers are crossed that no more drug moves are needed because as we all know, drug transitions are the worst with anti-seizure medication! The one side effect I experienced was increased irritability every day. My neurologist advised me to take B6. Within 48 hours of starting 25mg of B6 daily, I no longer experience irritability. EASE OF USE: Couldn't be any easier! Take one 500mg pill every 12 hours! EFFECTIVENESS AFTER LONG TERM USE: Same response as ""Effectiveness"" above. COST EFFECTIVENESS: I have health insurance which covers Keppra as a level 2 prescription so I only have to pay $20 for a three-month prescription thru the mail. If I picked up my prescription locally at a pharmacy, I would be paying $20/month."

But it was the most depressive, psychotic drug ever. I was on Phenobarbital, yes it can be weepy, but this was different. I got curious, you look it up, it states everywhere in side effects suicidal ideations so on and so forth. Several actually committed suicide prior it being FDA approved. Not one for me, nor anyone post partum nor if they were on a high dose of Phenobarbital. I was so depressed and didn't want to stick around. Man was I ever cranky in addition to being so depressed. And even wound up in a psych ward from it, for my neurologist back in Alabama didn't even understand the swift mood change I got from it. I was in there for 5 nights. They didn't realize, you come off of the drug, it is a whole new light! The interesting timing of when I was placed on this drug was I just had my baby in 2001 and was coming off a huge dosing of Phenobarbital I had been placed on. He had tried to bring me down to 360 from 660. I was seizing bad. He kept upping my dose to the ""max"" dose of Keppra 3000. Then also placed me on Klonopin .5x3. (found to be a depressant for me)Thank God, it didn't control my seizures, nothing did. So, I was pulled off of it. Nonetheless, being post-partum and throw all that in, I had it a bit more hard than the ""normal"" seizure patient on that drug trial. Just make sure you study what your doctor does before you take it on. If you have a lot going on in your life, this drug probably isn't the wisest decision. You just shouldn't have to be on antidepressants for a drug to control your seizure when there are drugs out there that don't tear your mood down. I always thank God He guided me to my current doctor, or I wonder if I would still be breathing air.

However, in the past year and half or so, my partial seizures increased and were occurring multiple times a month and drs were concerned b/c partials were coming one after another within a day...(however it was almost completely effective for tonic clonic--only one breakthrough about 3 yrs ago. I will miss Keppra dearly. It interacted with no drugs, never made me sleepy, although there was some debate over it increasing my anxiety (I've always been anxious, so not really certain about that). Overall, very effective for me. I took 1500 twice a day. Another weird thing, if you can consider this a side effect, it seemed to make my partial seizure visual hallucinations much more vivid and my auditory hallucinations a lot more threatening than pre-Keppra seizures--this was definitely not pleasant--before I could sort of fake my way through the seizure--on Keppra I was seriously freaked out and would tell people to shut up and leave me alone. I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 17--so officially dealing with it for 12 years or so. Just got back from a hospital stay to once and for all put a label on my epilepsy (which was never really done)--I have right temporal lobe epilepsy (we'll see what the MRI says--12 yrs ago--they said there was nothing there--aside from my brain, that is).

Now, I'm back on Tegretol, b/c the drs insist it's the best for TLE, despite my protests that I feel like a drunk zombie when I'm on it.

I was on Lamictal alone for awhile, which eliminated my complex partial seizures and slightly reduced the frequency of my simple partial seizures. My doctor added Keppra, and I immediately noticed a big improvement in control of my seizures, but after several months, the simple partial seizures increased in frequency again. I was put on a higher dose and things leveled off for awhile...but then picked up again. I'm now on an even higher dose and the simple partial seizures are sporadic. If you take this drug, you should watch your emotions and overall mood carefully. I'm more irritable than I was before (and I'm normally a bit irritable as it is). I've also been depressed off and on for the past several months and most recently, extremely depressed sometimes. I've even had some passing thoughts of suicide which are becoming rather frequent. I can't say with 100% certainty that this drug is the culprit...it could be something altogether different, because I'm having some other difficulties in my life at the moment. I find that having epilepsy itself is a bit depressing. But in hindsight, these big changes in my overall mood seem to have started a few months after first taking it, and I started to ""connect the dots"" after researching this drug some more. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But please, if you take this drug (or any other AED for that matter), watch yourself. And have close friends or relatives watch you too, because a drug might negatively affect your emotions and you may not even realize it yourself. I'll be talking to my doctor soon to see if I can go on a lower dose or stop it to see if my mood changes.

The Keppra has helped with the pain from the neuropathy. But the mood swings are awful. I see my doctor again in 2 days and will discuss this with her, as a single mother of 2 teen daughters its very hard not to yell and get upset over the little things, but I've never been this way so for them its very hard. Alot of the side effects are so close to the neuropathy I can't tell if it’s the medication. At first I thought it was the vicodin that was making me so angry, but after stopping the pain medication I now know it’s the Keppra. I keep a day planner and use that often... it helps me remember things that I no longer can. Any help w/depression medication would be great. UPDATE!! I talked with my Epileptologist (A neurologist with specialty training in epilepsy) she had no problem taking me off Keppra however, I will have to continue it for 5 more weeks. Heather started me on Lamictal yesterday; the only downside to starting this drug is… you start at a low dose and gradually work up to the therapeutic dose. That will take 3 months. She’s hopeful that the Phenobarbital will carry me through without any seizures. The side effects of the Keppra were unbelievable.

Hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying that, but after getting a more or less stable level of Keppra in my system (took it for two weeks, went back to clonazepam for a week because the Keppra didn't seem to be doing anything - don't judge it until at least a month if you have no horrible side effects! - back on the Keppra for another week, then a week where for various reasons I only ended up taking about one pill a day, then it took 4 or 5 more days of taking my pills breakfast-and-dinner-like-clockwork for me to feel normal), I've had fewer partial seizures than you can count on the fingers of one hand, and it's been two and a half or so that I've taken the pills without missing any. Which is quite a change from a few simple partials a day and unknown occurrences of complex partials (haven't had a *confirmed* one of those since I've been on it), so I'm pretty happy. Only thing that sucks is the feeling stoned out of my mind the week I first started it (not when I restarted after the clonazepam) and when I was forgetting a lot of pills, (curiously enough, having a single alcoholic drink one night seemed to snap me back into reality temporarily), and the bit of depression the first week I was on it (this didn't come back anytime after the first week, even when I wasn't being good with my meds!). Also, even with my living in Canada and having a drug plan, it's still expensive (relatively), so while I'm thinking 3x a day dosing might be better since it seems to leave your system so quickly, I haven't mentioned it to my doctor yet because of the cost.

This is the third AED I've tried to control my simple and complex partial seizures. (Trileptal acutally increased my seizure frequency from 5-8 a month to 10-20 a day.) The side effects are not as pronounced as trileptal. At first, I felt a bit drunk about 1/2 hour to 1 hour after taking the pill, but this only lasted about a week. I also had no appetite for about 2 weeks. I have brief encounters with depression, but fewer than I had with trileptal. I do feel physically lethargic, but more mentally alert than with trileptal. I had one simple partial yesterday and four today, but four is better than 20."

6/22/2005 8:03:22 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Keppra - Why it affects memory Keppra stimulates ""the actions of a natural brain chemical, GABA"". I googled GABA and found the following in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA): ""With regard to the human brain, it has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with the registration and consolidation stages of memory formation. This is thought to be possible because the GABA system is found in the hippocampus, an area of brain which has been implicated in memory formation."" Just wanted to share this. I know it doesn't make much of a difference, but it is still interesting! I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and started taking Keppra approx. a year ago, following a failed attempt to rely solely on Lamictal (changed to Lamictal from Depakote, because I wanted to have a child). Anyway, I can only say that I have managed to keep my seizures under control, granted that I follow the strict schedule of med. intake, since Keppra has such a short half-life (hence, no delaying dosages). As for the side-effects, I suffer from poor memory (I thought I was going senile, and I am only 30!), temper tantrums and mood swings, however the latter I try to keep to a minimum by taking deep breaths and taking a philosophical outlook on life. That doesn't always work though. In a way the side effects that have come with Keppra are better than those I had when taking Depakote. I would have a strange feeling, as if walking around in a glass bell (it is difficult to describe), and horrible stomach problems. My med of preference was Lamictal, with which I noticed no side-effects (possibly linked to its not working??). On a final note, I'd like to say that I was relieved to read about others in a similar situation as mine and that many of you have experienced similar side effects. I have told my neurologist about these and he tries to dismiss any critique of Keppra (he's writing a paper on it and is a big proponent of it)."

At first when I started taking it after a few weeks I had MAJOR mood swings and layed on my couch. ( IM OCD ) active, running in the yard with my kid and it made me not want to do nothing. I cried, I screamed, then I was I was calm, then It started all over again. Then I couldn't remember after a month. The memory loss got really bad. Keppra was also interfering with my other meds and making my levels tremendously low. Then because of my memory, I had to write down everything and I started forgetting tooooo many things. Then I went to the ER cause Neuro WOULD NOT call me back, all they said was go to the ER. The ER thought I was nuts but I left the hospital cause they were trying to transfer me to the psyche ward. What was going on was what I had what is called an Adverse side effect. An overdose is when you take something and it works but you took to much of it. An adverse side effect is when it don't work and reacts. Keppra reacted badly. Depressed, mood swings, memory loss and at first could not sleep. after a few weeks, you couldn't wake me up. I had a seizure in my sleep and nobody could wake me up. I know it did NOT control my seizures, In FACT it made them worse. Had over 30 grand mals in less than 4 days. HELLO DOCTORS.....everyone was telling them it was the drug Keppra but they wouldn't listen. Now I have been off of the Keppra for over a week and am getting back to normal. Well, I always say even though I have seizures I am still normal ( to an extent>...) and I love me. Do your research on his medicine especially if you take other meds.

I went to a new neuro, having been happy on phenobarbital for 5 years now, complaining that the phenobarb was being hindered a bit by a new (unrelated) drug I started taking, as I was forewarned it might... well, he said, since I'm 25 now and phenobarb can oftentimes stop being ""as"" effective as you get older, he wanted to put me on a new drug to supplement... that being Keppra. First 2 weeks, it felt like someone was taking an ice pick to my forehead from the inside. For from around 30-60 minutes after taking it to about 3 hours after, I laid in bed with a pillow on my head crying because it just hurt SO bad... worse than my worst migraines had ever been. I had to keep telling myself ""side effects go away, they can go away...."" and after a week, they lessened, after 2 weeks, no more headaches... whew, relief... As for what it's doing for me, so far, I can't really say--my seizures haven't lessened from it that I can tell, but I'm also on that very low dosage still of 500 a day. Good thing I'm still on phenobarbital. I do, though, appreciate the honesty of those 5% or so of trial patients that reported suicidal ideation--it really felt like something that, were I depressed by nature, would tip me over the edge and make me just want to jump off a cliff. Frankly, even in my heavy process of rationalization, I wanted to at least toss that bottle over one. so the side effects can get better, I wouldn't give up so quick, but if a doc starts you off high, I'd see another doc to be totally frank, as 250 at a time is quite enough adjustment to start."

It did almost nothing to control my seizures. The only other drug I have taken that was less effective was Depakote, which didn't control my seizures at all. What I did find out though, is that Keppra does have a benefit as a ""booster"" for Felbatol. By taking Keppra in combination with Felbatol, I was able to reduce the dosage of Felbatol I had to take and the side effects of Keppra offset those of Felbatol (except aplastic anemia, which you either do or don't get with Felbatol... if you go six months without your liver being damaged, odds are you won't ever have a problem with it at all). One other point. The normal dosage of Keppra is every 12 hours. When used as a ""booster"" for Felbatol, taking it every eight hours works better. When taking it every 12 hours, the booster effect fell off after about 10 hours. So I take the combination every eight hours, with a dosage of 1000 MG each time, for 3000 MG per day. At first it was 4500 MG per day, but I was able to reduce it to 3000 after going to the 3 times a day dosage instead of twice a day since there is almost no fall off in the first 8 hours."

Keppra was effective for bringing down the mania. I stopped taking it then. now I am on Lamictal monotherapy for depression. the Keppra will be used if I have a manic episode. for me the side effects from Keppra would be intolerable for a long period."
7/7/2003 12:49:30 AM,0.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Hope you have good insurance! Keppra alone costs us about 500 - 700 a month and that's with a tiny bit of insurance kicking in. it's difficult to say whether or not it is making any difference as our 7 yr. old is now on 3 meds (lamictal, keppra and zonegran) and they've been adjusting all three of them. She quite definitely is not herself and is extraordinarily moody. We'll hopefully be getting off the medication mess soon ... her doctors don't really seem to do anything other than react by increasing a medication dosage."

Her doc gave her Keppra and she became an evil monster on it and she was still having at least one fit a day. Now she is back on Lamotragen/Tegretol and is as sweet as ever. Keppra is bad, bad, bad."
7/1/2003 6:40:07 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,Keppra I have been on Keppra for roughly 3 months after the onset of seizure disorder that had been under control for 12 years by taking Tegretol. I knew Tegretol was no longer working when I started having strange auras then a grand mal seizure. Keppra was horrible at first with side effects for me. Ranging from mood swings to insomnia to intolerance of food items. I have finally overcome all of the side effects except insomnia. This is what I am currently struggling with. My auras are gone and I have been seizure free since I have been on it. Since my health insurance has recently changed - it is an expensive medication!

6/8/2003 6:22:27 PM,0.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Keppra- Combination headaches After 1 week of use, Keppra only seems to be causing headaches upon waking. My doctor said it is not from the Keppra. I did my own 'study.' After 2 consecutive days of not taking it, and waking with no headache, I am assuming it is a side effect of Keppra. I will try it again to see if same results occur. I hope everyone taking it knows that in clinical trials it caused suicidal tendencies, with several attempted suicides and one which was successful."

I feel a little ""dull,"" but it is certainly something I can live with. The feeling may be the side effect of the seizure I had on Thursday. I'll keep you posted."

3/9/2003 1:41:16 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Super & Expensive! I've had epilepsy for over 30 years, and have tried at least a dozen different anti-seizure medications, going from brand to brand, combinations, amounts, frequency--all depending on advice offered by neurologists who've known me for little more than 30 minutes. I've always been one to provide well-worded word processed versions of what's been happening to me neurologically since last seeing my doctor. Ideal patient, I guess. One who's even served as a ""lab rat"" in national try-outs of pills that manufacturers were hoping to get NFDA approval. However, nothing better has come into my neurological tale than Keppra! My seizures are about 75% better controlled, and milder than ever before, and I myself have gotten at least a couple-dozen friends with epilepsy to inquire about Keppra. Problem is, Keppra's cost! It's insane. And being produced by an American corporation, we're going to have to wait another six or seven years before an affordable generic version can be created and is easily available. Why must we Americans have to face such crafty corporate pricing? Maybe if Keppra were more affordable, more people would purchase it...and seizures less common. Love you, Keppra, but please rethink the price tags on those bottles!"

2/21/2003 3:47:14 AM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Keppra I have had complex partial seizures since 1985. These went misdaignosed until my grand mal in 1997. From anti depressants to anti covulsants wsa not a good experience. I tried Dilantin with bad results, a then ""Study Drug"" Zonegran with seizures still occuring, and then Tegretol was added to the Zonegran, I still was having as many as 10 Complex partials a day. Then they added Keppra and the seizures stopped. The only time I would have a seizure would be if I missed a dose. Unfortunately, while on Keppra I became very depressed. I tried to jump out of moving cars, and I was hospitalized for fear of suicide twice. Additionaly I became an ogre at home. Screaming at my wife about the littlest things. One time I even called a friend and told him my wife was trying to kill me. Eventually I called the doctor to question these outbursts and in her absence a nurse I had never met called me back. I explained to her my cycle of rage and depression. She ASKED ME if I was on Keppra. Apparently between Keppra and Zonegran, this stuff happens all the time. Under medical supervision I have been off of Keppra since last March. Two months after my front temporal lobectomy. I haven't had any seizures since. And I don't jump out of cars any more."

After 25 years of letting my doctors talk me into trying something new, she almost did me in by talking me into Keppra. I couldn't walk. I couldn't talk. My behavior became totally different, not in a positive way. This is not a good medication. If your doctor asks you to try K E P P R A, you may want to ask your doctor if they really care about you at all."

Even the Prozac I have to take w/ it, doesn't help. I am more miserable on the Keppra than off- the only ""plus"" is that I don't have as many seizure episodes. I wish I would be prescribed something else."

At times he can't even walk across a threshold, he is afraid of falling. And getting up steps is almost impossible. Now after nearly 2 years we are to the point where we don't know what is worse the seizures or the side effect!!!!"

However, I've now been on this for seven months and am experiencing side effects that are being considered a result of the Keppra. These include severe muscle twitching, spasms, pain, restlessness, and a definite change in mood including lack of concern."
