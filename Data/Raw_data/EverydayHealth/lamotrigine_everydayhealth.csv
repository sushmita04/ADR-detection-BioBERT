4/1/2022 8:16:30 AM,2 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I woke up in so much pain after 2-3 days on Lamotrigine at 25 mg. All-over body aches, my low back, and especially painful (almost immobilizing) were the areas I already experience daily pain from osteoarthritis. I felt like I'd been beaten in my sleep, on top of that pain. Sometimes I doubt my experience and judgments, but this was undeniable and very unusual for me. I took the pill for one more day and the pain was even worse; so, I stopped on the 5th day for the entire weekend. On Monday, my doctor said this wasn't a common side effect and probably unrelated. (Why I'm adding this review). So, giving it a good try, I started again that day and hoped to narrow this down to the medicine. It was slightly less painful, but within 4 days I had a lot of pain again. I talked to my doctor today and said maybe this Rx triggers inflammation in my body. So, for what it's worth, Lamotrigine didn't work for me. In fact, it made my life worse for those two weeks; and with my MDD/Depression and Complex Trauma symptoms, more trouble is the very last thing I need in the world. I may or may not try another mood stabilizer in the future. I'm wary, to say the least."

3/21/2022 10:51:45 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,I was diagnosed with Bipolar NOS and I take this in conjunction with Zoloft. I have not felt this well since I was a little kid! First two weeks I was extremely tired. I adjusted. I also experienced headaches during ovulation. I lowered the dosage and it was resolved.
3/8/2022 12:30:36 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,Been on Lamictal for a few months after being diagnosed with bipolar type 2. No side effects and has really helped
3/6/2022 4:42:15 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"So I was recommended to try this for depression (for which I believe was wrongfully diagnosed as this whole thing started because of anxiety and panic attacks). Started the regular titration schedule, got to 100mg then all hell broke loose in my mind. I had severe suicidal ideations, became obsessive over the meaning of life, uncontrollable crying, increased panic attacks and anxiety, nightmares, disassociation. IT WAS AWFUL. Being a nurse I did some research and found these to be uncommon, yet still possible side effects. I’m working on titrating off of it which is awful too. I had only been on it five weeks when this all occurred. All I know is I’ve been told when this whole situation started for me that it was due to a lot going on and brought on by stress as I’ve never had issues with anxiety, panic, depression or other mental health ailments in the past (35 y/o). Three months later I’ve been put on three different meds all with adverse effects, this by far being the worst. If it works for you, that’s wonderful and I’m glad it works. If it doesn’t, I’m right there with you. I CANNOT WAIT to have this medication out of my system."

Since I switched to Lamotrigine, my seizures are under control and I am driving again. My sleep has not been effected, no change in weight and the aggressive feelings are completely gone. It has changed my life!"
5/4/2021 11:29:14 PM,2 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I've been on these for maybes ten years or over (uk female). I was quickly maxed up to 200mg/two tablets a day and they worked for the first few years. Lamotrogine now has heightened my depression, has made me lose all creativity and done something to my body as I come up negative for auto immune diseases, like throid problems, but I display all symptoms with negative blood results and I am free from contraception. The extra depressive feelings obviously make me stay in the house, I can get aggressive, physically abusive, psychotic, basically all of the bad things about bi polar it has kept. It has broken and burn't all bridges with any support I have, but the psychaitrist will not change my medication after numerous requests because I have a job and have not killed myself yet. I am very very scared to come off lamotrgine due to my body being on it for so long and my brain now feels numbed out that I may end up with seizures and memory probems. I was perfectly fine before this.... So it was an off the record thing at the time/still is and I just wished I hadn't been on it for so long. I am only taking it because my body is used to it, it does nothing for my mental health."

3/28/2021 4:09:48 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Borderline Personality Disorder Report ,"24yrs been on 200mg for 2 years now for BPD+BD. Drastic change in my life, moods less intense 9/10 improved, but not fully gone. Considering increasing dose but not sure. I still have horrible anxiety and jumpiness, feels like I will tip over into mania any time. Very disconcerting, but overall I have to say - a miracle drug. SE: when starting off drowsiness etc for a couple weeks - normal! Please don’t let it deter you. Other than that, weird SE I got: period changes for a while but resolved, word-finding difficulty! That was a weird one but it’s gone now too. Honestly overall an easy medication for me. My worst fear is worse side effects or it stops working - I pretty much depend on it entirely for a normal, functional life"
3/19/2021 2:53:34 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I started taking Lamictal 4 weeks ago. Slowly increasing the dose weekly until I reached 100mg. At this point I am having horrible migraines, confusion, whole body soreness and pain, nausea, always sleeping and never rested, feeling like I’m desperate from everyone. I also had an episode over the weekend where I stared off in space and don’t remember parts of it. My husband said I was jerking and laughing. I was taken to the hospital and the doctor said it seems I’ve had a seizure and need an eeg test from a neurologist. Lamictal is the one and only change that has taken place in the past 4 weeks. I am slowly coming off of it now. I’m praying I can go back to my life without these horrible side effects."
3/10/2021 11:02:52 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Borderline Personality Disorder Report ,I've been on this crap since I was like 18. I'm 27 now and it doesn't work and has made things worse. I increased my dosage to the max and have been feeling so sick and psychotic. I didn't get any swelling but def have itching skin at times. I pee a lot. I'm exhausted all the time. Noises and sounds bother me. I get sensory overload. It's supposed to help and maybe it does but I think it's making my body shut down.
2/8/2021 4:50:36 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"I started Lamictal 25mg two weeks ago and at day 15 I was told to go up to 50mg. I woke up the next day with an ulcer on my bottom lip in the middle. Then throughout the day my mouth developed ulcers inside on my tongue, cheeks, and throat. It felt like I ate a bunch of sour candy - very raw feeling and I also felt like I was getting the flu. I waited for a while and then I began experiencing itchy prickly skin on my face, neck, chest, and upper arms. I called the emergency line at my doctors office and they were very concerned. Told me to take Benadryl immediately and stop taking the Lamictal. I am on my second day of Benadryl and I can barely talk my mouth is so messed up. I never thought I would get SJS, but I really think it’s the beginning stages of it."
2/5/2021 6:06:16 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I had great success initially—moods leveled out, anxiety was reduced, not so “on edge” all the time. I finally found the right med for me, I thought. Started on Lamotrigine 25mg then 50mg/day. But after about 20 days everything spiraled out of control— anxiety ramped up in the extreme, I was suicidal, and I often felt enraged over nothing. I have never had anger issues. I stopped taking it. Over the next 3 yrs I tried it 4 more times — smaller dose, larger dose. I kept going back on it because I had just pleasant immediate results. But every time in less than two weeks a spike of all my worst symptoms. Too bad — I had great expectations."
2/1/2021 4:33:43 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I am manic-depressive and under psychiatric care for about 50 years. Recently, I fell into a suicidal depression and got put on lamotrigine. I take 200 mg. per day. I believe that it has helped me since I seem to be managing my life much better now. My friends and family tell me I seem so much better. At night I take a small dose of Zopiclone, which helps me fall asleep. The combination seems to work well, with virtually no side-effects. On a scale of 1-10, my mood is a 6-7. Not suicidal anymore, and not manic/crazy either. I would recommend the drugs I take, but consult with a good psychiatrist, first. Definitely worth a try! At least I can face the day now, with no ill-effects."

12/31/2020 2:02:47 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Borderline Personality Disorder Report ,"This medication saved my life when I was 20 years old and I have been on it for almost 4 years now. The only side effects I experience are related to memory loss. I cannot stand it. It seems minor compared to the other side effects, but to me it is a big deal. However, I do understand that when it comes to medication you have to take the good with the bad. Aside from that, this medication is a life saver. If you are on a low dose and it is working, stay on it in order to avoid side effects including cognitive difficulties!"
12/23/2020 10:43:54 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Report ,I was intolerant of several SSRI’s and only partially tolerant of Trintellix at small doses. Gabapentin and Buspar didn’t work. I had excellent resolution of symptoms with low dose lamotrigene with no side effects. For me a miracle drug. It is worth noting it may take a trial of several drugs to find one that works with tolerable side effects.
12/17/2020 8:15:10 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I was prescribed lamictal for bipolar 2. After taking it for a couple of days I broke out in a horrible rash and starting vomiting. Er doctors told me that I am allergic and to stop. I then began taking seriously. I just want to say if a med isn’t working for you or makes you sick, tell your provider, there are many other meds they can give you."

Ive tried many different anti depressants and none of them have worked (some worked very short term) but this pill gave me life and the serotonin i need! If you’re suffering from extreme social anxiety, don't give up there is hope!! This pill really helps me stay calm and focused around others! I take 200mg a night alone, no other pills. And the best part, no side effects what so ever!"
12/14/2020 8:07:48 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I took Lamotrigine for 9 years off label for chronic depression. I experienced bad side effects from the beginning, but my psychiatrist encouraged me to keep taking it. My memory suffered the most. It was a nightmare finally getting off of it. It has been five years now since getting off of it and my memory has never recovered fully. Lamotrigine is an EVIL medication. It may work for some people, but if you're one of those who it doesn't be prepared for a rough ride. : ( Listen to your own body, not your psychiatrist!"

9/17/2020 9:08:16 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I was suffering from such terrible depression after blindsided by a cheating husband and divorce after only 6 months of being married, I could not function. I'm only 33, and I currently have a very prestigious position that I worked hard to get to, and I needed some major assistance. I consider this drug life changing. I noticed a difference in my mood and emotions within days. What prompted me to leave a review is that I'm experiencing terrible post-nasal drip that makes me feel like something is caught in my throat. I went to an ENT to rule out everything else, and he says there is a lot of drainage there with no cause he can see. I'm almost positive it's a result of this drug. I wanted to see if anyone else encountered this and if they found any thing that helped. It's becoming a nuisance at work. Some days it is all day, some days I don't have it at all. Overall, if I had to decide to take the drug or not despite this side effect, I'd say it is worth it because I think it saved my life."

5/25/2020 6:50:02 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Umm yeah, been taking this med off and on for the past 20 years...

5/16/2020 12:35:34 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I've had depression since cognition. I am nearly 56 years old. I've burned through all sorts of anti-depressants. Was recently postulated that I am on the Bipolar II spectrum. On only 50 mg 2x/daily of Lamictal, I saw positive results in a month. I was starting to sleep better, the drug didn't wind me up. Unfortunately, I am Suzy Side Effect and tend to suffer the rarest kinds. I have osteoarthritis and Lamictal worsened my joint pain, caused other joints to hurt that hadn't, and made my muscles ache. Upon cessation the new pains subsided. If you have inflammation, watch out for this drug making things worse."
5/14/2020 10:45:56 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I had depression and anxiety and lamictal seemed to help as I took it. Unfortunately over the course of a year, there were some side effects. I started losing hair after a couple months which I thought was because of tying my hair in a bun at first. But then even my leg hair and underarm hair stopped growing --although that I didn't mind so much. Then after about half a year, I had constipation and gas. I started gaining a lot of weight. It seemed like I was getting hyperthyroidism according the the tests. It turned out to be lamictal. At first my psych didn't think so, but the lamictal seemed to be causing biotin/vitamin b deficiency in me. As soon as I stopped taking lamictal and took a biotin supplements, my hair started growing back, my digestion was no longer constipated and my tsh level went back to normal after about 4-6 months. Lamictal worked, but unfortunately the side effects were too bad for me."
1/29/2020 7:01:57 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Lamictal absolutely saved my life and I could see the results building steadily over time. The biggest area of change was in my irritability, which I saw dramatically decrease from near constant, blinding rage to almost nonexistence (1 day of irritability every couple months). My manic episodes are also noticeably decreased. My depression has decreased the least, but that is also because I have a secondary diagnosis of MDD, which I do not treat with an antidepressant. The only side effect is a little bit of persistent acne, which I have not been able to counteract. (I highly recommend taking a gene test to see which psych meds are compatible with your body! That is how I found Lamictal and I feel like a completely different human being.)"

1/10/2020 9:35:00 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I have taken Lamictal for a few years now. It has been the most helpful drug in dealing with my bipolar symptoms. Side effects have been minor. The worse in insomnia, but taking Klonopin twice a day helps not only my anxiety but a bit with sleep too. My pdoc had me on Effexor for quite awhile. Horrible drug, at least for me. Coming off of it was very difficult, but felt much better. After coming off of the Effexor,, I was on 400mg per day of Lamictal. For some reason my mania and anxiety, emotions went haywire in a bad way. I found that cutting the dose of Lamictal in half, down to 200mg per day has put made a huge huge difference. Wonder if anyone else has has something similar happen. Did decreasing your Lamictal after taking it for a long time actually help and make you feel better? Not sure if it is just because of the mix with Effexor, or ??? Maybe if I had been taking less I would have felt better long ago. I do think Lamictal is a wonderful drug and so helpful for me, but it was scary there for a bit."
11/8/2019 9:14:51 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Started on 25mg and worked my way up to 200mg a day. It worked for me, started being more productive, felt much happier (after years of depressing episodes). Felt like I wasn’t on a roller coaster anymore. Side effects were present and noticeable, and remember, this isn’t a cure. It’s something I had to cope with. There were times where I felt down again and questioned the treatment. But I’ve felt much more productive and happy."
9/24/2019 1:03:56 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I’ve been taking lamictal for 1.5 years now and I feel like a new person. My friends and family have noticed a significant change too. I’ve slowly made my way up to 500 mg and my dose is still being monitored. I’ve experienced a few side effects, one of the worst being double vision. I’ve learned how to manage it though. I just have to make sure I have a decent amount of food in my stomach especially if I’m having caffeine or alcohol. Another thing I experienced is decreased hunger. I’ve lost about 15 lbs over the course of taking it, but I’m not complaining. Of course, I still have to make sure I’m getting enough food in my stomach. Overall, this is the medication for me and it changed my life. I no longer experience the extreme cycles I was going through (I was cycling multiple times a day) and it has really set me free."
5/9/2019 12:03:31 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.) Report ,I'm neutral about this drug. I have been taking 200mg for approx. 1.5 years. Within the past week I have finally acknowledged the fact lamictal has side effects. I dug really deep into the effects on the brain. What I found has provided so much light. I have not been able to lose weight with extreme diet and hard core lifting. I've had bacteria gut. I've experienced constipation over the duration on lamictal and my hormones are completely off balance. I didn't realize these are side effects until I stumbled on a website that pointed these similar issues. Be ware of what this drug can do to you.

Still have bouts of mood disorder, and find it difficult to concentrate after being on it for 2 years. Before you start this med, make sure if you're actually feeling any difference. Stay on a low effective dose first. If you don't feel improvements within 4-6 weeks then consider something else."
3/23/2019 8:24:47 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Report ,This has changed my life. It took awhile to titrate up to my 150mg dose but boy was it worth it. It wasn’t until I was fully up to my current dose that I was able to think clearly. I had been depressed and anxiety ridden for so long and didn’t see how long it had truly been. I am free. I am happy. I will never look back. TRY IT!
3/13/2019 5:37:02 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I took this drug for 10 years. After being continuously raised on dose to 400 twice a day, my family asked that I see another doctor. Weaning off was EXTREMELY tortuous physically and mentally. It did help at first but my doctor would not try anything else. Since changing, I rarely have migraines, was having them daily. If a lower dose doesn't help, I recommend something else. Be honest and informative so your doctor can help you best as possible. Struggled for 44 years."
3/9/2019 7:21:02 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"I took a 10mg dose before bed for about five days. Did nothing to prevent my migraines, it actually made them worse than usually. Also I got a very bad rash all across my back and shoulders that felt like I was on fire."
3/5/2019 3:44:58 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar Disorder NOS Report ,"I have taken this for several months now, very very slowly titrating up to 150mg now. No side effects yet. I have noticed a slight antidepressant effect where I haven't felt depressed for more than maybe 1/2 hour on a few days. However I'm not sure about mania. Maybe we should raise the dose more because it seems I can get minor mania episodes and trouble sleeping with it if I'm not careful with my lifestyle. But overall it seems to be working ok."
3/4/2019 8:29:29 PM,2 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I have been on it for 3 months, I'm at 100mg. It is not helping me at all, in fact I feel worse. My doctor increased the dosage after I told him I was not feeling any better but worse!!!! I cry constantly & feel horribly depressed, much worse than before taking it. I am being weaned off of Seroquel from 300 mg down to 200 mgs so I'm not sure if thst is related with how I feel. I see my doctor next week & I am telling him this medication is making me feel worse!! Sleep problems, memory problems and also feeling extremely deoressed and feeling very racy. Apparently I am in the minority because it seems to help most people, but not me at all."

The side effects where major sleep problems, could not get to sleep at night and had trouble getting up in the morning's. I would sit in a chair and loose track of time just felt stuck and spaced out. It caused muscle weakness and stiffness felt like a 90 year old person and I'm in my 30's. Just be careful with this one. It doesn't show side effects right away they creep up on you and it's HELL getting off it. Good luck and don't give up."
1/14/2019 12:00:23 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,Lifesaver! Following a possible drug induced psychosis I went into a deep unipolar depression which got so bad I had to quit work. Commenced on abilify titrating up to 7.5mg followed by adding pritiq 200mg which helped some but couldn’t seem to get my motivation and zest for life back. Psychatrist suggested adding lamictal commencing on 25mg and going up by 25mg every two weeks until reaching 100mg. I could tell it was helping from the first pill but could not tell you how much it has helped me get back to normal life again. I think this should be the gold standard for severe depression. Truley a miricle drug.

I suffer from depression/PTSD and anxiety disorder. I've been on many anti-depressants and anxiety medications before. But, Lamictal I can seriously say saved my life."

I really enjoyed Lamictal when i first got on it. I wouldn't say it helped much with depression. It helped a bit with anxiety. It helped the mood swings a lot. I started at 25mg and worked my way up to 300mg in a few months. Only side affect I have is short term memory loss and delayed reaction time. I feel like the medication is helping my mood and the side effects didnt bother me at first. Now the people around me notice it. I retell stories and information multiple times and repeat it and have no recollation that i said it already. I forget things quickly and my thoughts are jumbled. I might have to find a different mood stabilizer or change dose. I would still reccomend.

Laid in a hospital bed for 13 days and nearly had to receive a liver transplant. It took a few months to get healthy again. So yeah, be careful it doesn't just straight up kill you. I'm lucky to be alive according to the various doctors I now have to work with as I continue recovery."
12/15/2018 8:59:25 AM,2 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I was taking generic lamotrigine made by Teva, hopefully they keep their trend going on losing money and eventually fold. Teva makes very very low quality generic drugs and had a disaster with Welbutrin as well. I took name brand lamictal and it worked okay but was only on it for three months, the Teva generic version was beyond a nightmare, any generic is pretty much junk in my opinion. Generic drugs aren't even tested so that alone should make you stay away from them. Teva lamotrigine caused so many side effects it was unreal, hair loss, memory loss, graying hair, vision nearly lost, weight loss, headaches that would kill two elephants, dry skin, insonnia, lowered immune system. There's probably a few more but let's just say it would've been better to scoop out a glass of water out of a toilet and chug it back than taking this poison. GSK knows more about this drug than they are letting on, wtf? No mention of memory loss on the drug side effects? Hair loss is rare?? Come on, people are starting to wake up to the fact that the FDA and big pharma are sleeping together! Name brand Lamictal did show some benefits but the generic Teva brand was beyond awful....I hope that"
12/14/2018 3:40:49 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I have taken Seroquel XR in the past, but these last few months I have been weaning off of it so my doctor prescribed Lamictal for BP disorder. So far I haven't felt much improvement but I did realize during recent bloodwork that my therapeutic blood level was too low. I'm currently taking 100mg of Lamictal, but I am also taking other meds to control my racing thoughts. I heard from some people that it is a wonderful and effective drug with little side effect especially if you're afraid to gain weight but you must start this med at a very low dose so you don't get the rash(Steven-Johnson syndrome). I wish everyone good luck but I think it's not helping me much for now yet I will stick with it for now perhaps in the near future my doctor and I will adjust the dosage to the correct therapeutic levels. Remember if this med isn't helping you then you must check your blood level before quitting this medication. Ask your doctor to check your blood levels. I think with this med you can take up to 400mg, but some people do well at a lower dose."

I have bipolar 1 and it’s the only mood stabilizer that works for me. No side effects at all other than amazing orgasms at 400 mg. The only problem is that I can’t orgasm without it now. Decreasing my dose causes Anorgasmia. I have to stay on it for the rest of my life and as long as I take it as prescribed (400mg), I have no problems, feel great, and have better orgasms."

I started on it with depakote and olanzapine initally, and this significantly brought me down and I was less hyper. That was 3 months ago, and now im Just taking lamictal. Honestly it does not affect me at all. I stopped it for a month and felt exactly the same. I started it again for a week now just to see any difference, and if anything I feel sadder. I dont know now, if i Will keep on taking it as prescribed by my doctor, or just stop cold turkey. it has little or no effect on me."

That in turn made my life on lamictal frustrating to not only me but those around me. My memory got so bad that I could barely even remember to medicate, which just made matters worse. I’ve been off Lamictal for a few months now and my memory is coming back, but I fear some Of it might be gone forever"

It altered my personality, ruined my memory, clouded my focus and made me scatter brained. This drug has ruined my friendships, stalled my career and affected my health. It also affected my periods and made my hair fall out. I’ve been off it six months now and my cognitive function is - slowly - returning. I feel like I’m waking up from a nightmare."

7/27/2018 3:23:28 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder in December 2017. I began taking lamictal In January and was fully titrated on at 75 mg by March 2018. Things were definitely manageable; I wasn’t getting major migraines or staying in my depressive episodes for long. It took some time but there was definitely a noticeable change in the length and severity of my episodes. In the summer, I get even more depressed, and so my doctor prescribed me Lexapro (5 mg) to add to my regimen. Within 30 minutes of taking 5mg of Lexapro, I felt jittery but good! For the next two nights however, that jittering turned to anxiety and insomnia and I could not sleep at all. On the 3rd day, we decided to lower the Lexapro dosage to 2.5 mg and taken earlier in the day. Since then I have been able to sleep, function, etc normally! I didn’t think it was possible to feel good. I don’t feel hypomanic, and I haven’t felt depressed since taking the right dosage of the Lexapro. Sometimes I’m tempted to stop taking Lamictal because the Lexapro works so well. However if you have bipolar disorder, you should never stop taking your mood stabilizer."

It took my Psychiatrist 18 months to find these two drugs that work superbly for me. I've been on them for 9 years now and I feel absolutely normal. I have no mood swings, no panic attacks, and no anger issues anymore. I think the problems I face now are the same kind of problems any person has. I'm able to exercise patience now and think things through before making decisions whereas before I made bad choices and impulsive decisions and had a lot of trouble coping with every day life and every day problems. I feel content, even happy at times, and very centered. People can't tell that I'm bipolar which is a testament that psychiatric drugs can and do work."

I'm 31 now and I have been prescribed 10+ different antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs in various amounts and combinations from then until now. Nothing really helped very much with my depression and the side effects I experienced were intolerable. I've been taking 100mg Lamictal combined with Buspar 12.5mg BID for a few months now and I've never felt so stable. It's night and day. This medication changed my life. I was so reluctant after years of disappointment not responding to treatment that I'm so glad I tried this at suggestion of my therapist. Full disclosure, I experienced some side effects initially, but they were mild. Some dizziness at the beginning that disappeared over time and I also gained five pounds the first month and lost it again already. I'd recommend this highly to others who have tried antidepressants and not responded well."
3/31/2018 7:21:56 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I LOVE Lamictal!! I am a 32 year old female who has been on and off meds since the age of 14. I originally took this pill for a year before going medication-free (against my doctor’s advice). I felt so damn amazing on this pill yet it felt so natural. I never knew what it was like to be naturally happy and outgoing until taking these pills. I went from being hopeless, depressed, and full of anxiety, paranoia, and rage - to waking up happy as hell and ready to try new things and talk to new people. I chose to go off this medication because I felt so naturally amazing I couldn’t imagine going into that “dark place” mentally ever again and I also wasn’t ready to accept I would need pills for the rest of my life. Well, it only took a couple of months of getting off the meds before the downward spiral started again and before I knew it, I spent 6 months in a deep and nasty state of depression. It was hell. I am back on Lamictal again finally and loving it. Lamictal has never caused any bad side effects for me! I feel naturally good, as if this is how I was MEANT to feel."
3/6/2018 12:20:31 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I continue to be astonished at how much Lamictal has transformed my life. I wrote an earlier glowing review after it first starting working (about 6 weeks after initiating treatment). Here we are 7 months later and it's impossible to describe just how well it's worked. After 30 years of treatment-resistant depression (never diagnosed with bipolar, but I think I fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum), I am now - as my wife puts it - the ""best version of my self"". Currently taking 200 mg/day along with 300mg of Effexor (the only anti-depressant that ever did anything). Wondering if I could get by without the Effexor, but don't really want to tweak now when everything is going so well (plus Effexor is hell to get off of). The one thing I've noticed with Lamictal is that there aren't a lot of average reviews of it - people generally rave about it or don't like it at all. If your doctor recommends it, I highly recommend trying it. You have nothing to lose. And if it works as well for you as it has for me, you'll realize how many lies your depression was telling you. Wish I had found it earlier than 49 years old, but better late than never :-)"

2/26/2018 11:16:15 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I used to be in serquil for the longest time before (thankfully) getting switched to the generic lamictal. I haven’t really had a depressive episode since. However It came with some nasty side effects. I had extreme loss in appetite and lost several pounds, before being given something to offset this. Also I’ve been dealing with insomnia which I have to take allergy medication to deal with (since I’m 19 my psychiatrist didn’t want to give me something to sleep). So instead of originally taking one pill I now have to take three. However if nothing else has worked for you, than I would recommend this as long as you’re aware of the side effects."

With in the first few days I felt a huge difference but after about 2 weeks is when I really noticed a remarkable change. It has literally been a God send to me. I also take it with wellbutrin, klonopin and they are tapering me off of the Seroquel by reducing the dosage and adding Gabbapentin, which so far is working well. But I would highly reccomend trying this drug out!"

To no success,I gave up on finding a mood stabilizer that would help me,and just went about my life. That is,until just recently I went through a really bad Depressive episode..by that I mean I was crying 24/7,I felt immensely upset on the inside,even though I really didn't have a reason to be,and I could barely function and get out of bed each day. Then I saw my psychiatrist,and he prescribed me 50 mg of Lamictal,which is two doses of 25mg that I take twice a day. I'm going on day 4 on this medicine,and I feel so much happier. My mood has improved,and I have a more positive attitude. The only side effect I experienced so far while taking Lamictal,is it makes you drowsy. Which is cool for me,because I had trouble sleeping anyway. I'd rate this medicine 10 stars if I could,that's how well it worked for me"
12/31/2017 2:30:33 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,I switched from a vampiric acid oxcarbazapine combo when the vampiric acid wasn't agreeing with my kidneys and got on lamotrogine. At first when titrating on to it i experienced insomnia which went away as I got used to it. I like it better than the other meds I have taken for my epilepsy but honestly I don't know if I do or If I'm just more used to the side effects of seizure meds that I got on when I was 16 and dub it superior for not noticing the side effects. Since I got on it I have had a couple seizures and am debating if it's giving me bouts of loss of focus I keep Losing focus of my vision but if I look at myself in the mirror or a camera it comes back imidiatly I should probably tell my Dr. About it but I have friend who every time he comes around it happens and it's basicly only when he comes over so I'm pretty sure it's probably people doing some type of psychic dialation of my pupils since they think I'm some type of retard for being on seizure meds. I think I have became a little scitsofeinic since starting lamictal in connection to the spacial plane or something have been diagnosed with scitsophrinia in the past.

Lithium wasn't helping with depression really. and furthermore, I was experiencing this cyclical anxiety several hours after I took it each day. I thought ""what do you have to lose Chris?"" and switched to lamictal. easing into it was tedious I'll admit. that's the only bad thing I can say about it. My depression is gone, my anxiety is much better. I am getting along with my family so much better because I am not tense or depressed or agitated anymore. I would give it 6 stars if i could. No medication is for everybody, some will not like it. But if you are bipolar type 2 i think you should give this one a try. In the space of 6 weeks it has changed my life."

This was the peak of my suffering. I was just not myself anymore at this point. I never remembered much of what went on in my day and my creative part of my mind comepletely shutdown. This medicine took away what make me me. I also got horrible head aches throughout the day. Some were so bad that I couldn't leave the house.

I was worried medication would make me not care about anything, but now I care about the right things. It has made me a better mother and professional. That living in the moment thing that used to seem like a joke is now my life 98 percent of the time. I'm currently taking 75mg per day, along with 150mg of Zoloft. I had to titrate up very slowly because I developed mild irritation on my neck when I jumped up to 100. I doubt it was due to this med, but we backed off just in case. I went from having a complete breakdown due to a traumatic event where every minute was agony, to feeling the best I have since I was very young. It wasn't overnight, and though this medication played a big part, I also went to a PHP program that helped me find my self worth and develop more positive self talk, and to move forward with my life. I changed jobs, which was very scary, but now that I have a job I love, I realize what a terrible rut I was in. I firmly believe in using every tactic you can to climb out of mental illness - life changes, therapy, diet, exercise, but for me medication has been key"

I've had severe anxiety for as long as I can remember, and more recently severe depression with bouts of hypomania. I've tried an assortment of drugs, some helping slightly with others making my problems worse. I felt like there was nothing that was going to help me. I lost my job, lost my scholarship to my university, and was no longer able to take classes. I was racking up thousands in debt when I've always been financially responsible. I isolated myself from friends and family. I turned to drugs and alcohol for relief. I felt like there was no hope. I blamed myself for feeling the way that I did.

As others have noted, you have to titrate up gradually on Lamictal so it can take about six weeks (in my case) to start seeing improvement. At 75mg/day I definitely began to notice a change for the better and at 100mg/day (which I've been taking now for 5 days) the positive impact has been dramatic. I don't wake up every morning plagued by anxiety and negative, self-loathing rumination. I am actually happy which hasn't been the case for many years (I've suffered from major depression/anxiety for close to 30 years and went through such a bad period 3 months ago that I ended up in the hospital and had to take 5 weeks off from work). I'm getting more done and feel more engaged and connected to my life. Things just don't bother me like they used to and I've been amazed at the effect that it's had on quieting that self-loathing voice in my head.

Meaning, when I encountered a trigger for a panic attack, I would pause and then realize I was okay. After another week and a half, I have found myself in situations that would have caused me to break down in tears and not be able to function without other support systems, but I am now able to walk across parking lots, be in crowds, tackle stairs and escalators without a second thought. The only issue I have had with this medication is a pretty significant tremor in my hands and legs. The tremor in my legs is pretty pronounced for several hours after I take my daily dose and the tremor in my hands never goes away, but I'm able to go to the grocery, the mall, the library and not have a panic attack when I try to walk from my car to the door. I'll put up with the tremors to be able to live a normal life with a little bit of shakiness."

5/16/2017 3:55:40 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"It took a while for my psychiatrist to diagnose me with Bipolar II. My initial diagnosis was GAD and severe recurrent depression. A year of SSRI use (Lexapro, Prozac, Pristiq, and finally Zoloft) gave me not only panic attacks but also brief periods (30 minutes at a time) of dissociation and psychosis. Finally I switched to a new psychiatrist who got me off the Zoloft (my final attempt at using an SSRI to cure my severe depression and mood swings) and started me on Lamictal. 4 months later I am about to graduate from high school, have a job, and will attempt college in the fall. I am so much better!! Dr. says I have bipolar 2, which explains why the SSRI drugs messed me up so much. Also, my hypomania was mild, consisting mainly of overachieving and irritability, making it hard to spot in our culture. I was also briefly on Seroquel to help reverse the bad affects of Zoloft. Am now on 200 mg of Lamictal, extended release. This drug takes a while to build up but it is likely the right drug if you have Bipolar 2."

Within a week of being on Lamictal, I found myself sleeping all day and unable to motivate myself to perform simple tasks. Around the second week of being on it, I began having vivid nightmares, as if I was watching a horror film every time I fell asleep. I also started to have overwhelming suicidal thoughts and intense dissociation episodes. Unfortunately, dropping the dosage of this medication too quickly may cause a deadly rash, so I had to be slowly weened off of it.

I'm also on the anti depressant Lexapro but I'm positive Lamictal is the one that has helped me a lot. I've been suicidal ever since I can remember (even as a YOUNG child), now I rarely am suicidal. This drug has made me more confident, almost fearless in a way. I'm able to do things I couldn't before because of my depression. I feel more happy, carefree, less dead inside on Lamictal. I rarely cry, feel anxious, and suicidal. The side effects I have with it- sometimes I feel a little dizzy. I often get headaches. That's about it.

I say ""missed"" because during the day I only take it as needed, up to 300mg but usually less. If I don't get enough sleep for a couple days I really need to dose up, sleep is super important, other stressors less so but def play a factor."

My new psychiatrist has changed my diagnosis from bipolar II to depression/anxiety. The side effects are a deal breaker for me. My neck and jaw are stiff, shoulders ache in the morning, sinuses swell up shortly after I take it making it difficult to breathe through my nose. I have cut back on it with help from the psychiatrist, but the side effects are worse for about a month and there is anger and some paranoia during the withdrawal period. It's going to take a long time to get completely off of it."

However I was more social and less anxiety on lithium and I'd still be taking lithium if I didn't gain 20 pounds. Lamictal makes me eat more and I have had a large belly ever since I started taking it. It's gotten to the point that I no longer want to be on it. Walking around feeling four months pregnant all the time does not help my self esteem. I will be getting off it.

I was scared and frantic constantly. I could drive 30 minutes from my house without panic attacks. I couldn't sleep and had to take a week off work. It was one of the scariest things I have ever had to go through. My doctor started me on Lamictal. I've been on it almost a year and a half. Though I still have days with high anxiety and a general level each day, the improvement has been great. I feel like it gave me my life back. I'm a work in progress but this has been a great medicine for me. It does come with some dizziness and if I miss a dose I get a bad headache and get moody but as long as I take it as normal I feel pretty good. I know 4 other people who take this and also seem to really enjoy it."

They have reduced a bit, but I had to increase my dose to 700mg a day from the 400mg I started at. I have found that even if I take it on time during both morning and night (400mg in the morning - 300mg at night), I have to be sure that I eat something in the morning or else I will have a seizure later that day. And I don't mean a piece of toast. I mean a substantial breakfast. So, it works, it's just testy as to whether or not that 700mg dose will continue to work throughout the day."

I was so out of control and could not sleep at all so I was using weed to eat and sleep. The only side effects I'm experiencing at this point is some pain; shoulders and joint pain. Before taking the meds I was very depressed, suicidal, manic. I still feel some depression but no suicidal and not manic. I hope I get even more better after the increased mg. I worry about that because when increased on meds that's when the side affects kicks in. I can only hope!"

I'd been on Wellbutrin XL 300 for a while as well but it had lost effect. She said lamictal was one of the few drugs not meant to cause the side effects above. I took 25mg the first day and after about 6 hours had bouts of dizziness and nausea. They subsided a bit until the second day when I took another 25mg. While the dizziness wasn't unbearable, I had some plans for the week and realized I wouldn't be able to handle them with this side effect, so asked my doctor if I could stop after this low dose and start again in a week or so. She said it would be fine, but it's now been 3 days since I took my last pill and I STILL have dizziness and nausea. I'm not sure I'm going to try this again. The fact that it is still messing with my system 3 days later is frightening."

I work full-time with no significant issues and live a productive life. It has definitely improved my functioning, although I'm not completely symptom free. I have experienced very little to no side effects on Lamictal. Maybe a slight decrease in appetite, but this was a positive change since other meds have made me hungry all the time. My pdoc wanted to avoid doing regular blood work that is required with some of the other mood stabilizers, so Lamictal is a great choice for me, and I'm so glad I tolerate it well.

Of course, even though I explained my mishaps with the new medication and constant black outs and previous unwanted suicide attempt, they put me away for two weeks. I didn't want to take the drug anymore for obvious reasons, but they told me I was under contract since it was a trial drug and that if I stopped taking the drug, they would have me institutionalized anywhere from 6 months to two years. So, I kept taking lamictal...for obvious reasons. I was a wreck and very skiddish when I got out of there. I decided to toss out the meds, close my bank account and left town. It didn't take long after I stopped the meds that I actually felt ok. I was traumatized, but I stopped blacking out and trying to hurt myself.

Sometimes, I would come to and I would be at a friend's house and they're trying to calm me down, but I was so confused as to how I got there or what I did to make them so concerned. I called my doctors every single day when something like this would happen and they kept telling me to ""up my dosage."" Convincing me that my dosage just wasn't strong enough. I was desperate to get better. So, I listened. Within 2-3weeks my dosage was at 150-200mg. At this point, I blacked out so much, I eventually came to in a hospital. Apparently, my liver was failing. I was told that I tried overdosing and it was too late to pump my stomach. My heart rate shot down to 36bpm."

My depression at different moments has been treated with Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Abilify, Lithium, Effexor, And Zoloft. Sometimes, depending on the many psychiatrists who treated me, my depression was attributed to Bipolar II, Dysthymia, or a severe episode of major depression. With almost all of the drugs I eventually built up to the maximum dosage before I was switched to a different drug (a.k.a. the ""poop-out effect""). Nothing I have taken worked consistently to lift the depression. Recently a psychiatrist prescribed Lamictal as an off brand depression medication for a depressive brain that ""works like a bipolar brain."" I have been suicidal, non-functional, hopeless, and sobbing since I was first prescribed the Lamictal three months ago.

What I did get was two enormous swollen lymph nodes in my neck near my clavicle bone. One was the size of a kidney bean and the other the size of a pea about an inch apart. Let me tell you- I went to bed feeling fine and I woke up after the second day of the 100mg and all I felt was pain in my neck. After checking online I read that this was a side effect of Lamactil and I had to stop taking the medication. First day I felt pretty horrible. That night I had profuse sweating. The swollen lymph nodes lasted about seven days after being off the medication. Medically there isn't much you can do except take Motrin for the pain which did help. What a nightmare. I do not recommend Lamactil just because of the horrible possible side effects!!! I'm going to have to find something else for my bipolar but now I'm terribly afraid. On a side note while on the medication I never felt stable or mood controlled. I still had mo"
9/21/2015 4:18:55 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I was diagnosed BPII by my psychiatrist but my psychologist said I had no problems. But I started taking Seroquel combined with Lamictal because I was actively suicidal and isolated myself for about a year (this was few years back). I took this combination for about 2 years, and am in the process of tapering off. Currently at 50mg Seroquel and 50mg Lamictal per day. Generally, the combination stabilised my mood a lot where I don't get super anxious or uptight all the time and it was able to help me go through stressful times without me breaking down / unable to function. I feel Lamictal is pretty good in helping me balance my moods (particularly the low ones). It doesn't make me sleepy, although Seroquel does. Anyone suffering for emotional problems, my recommendation is use medications only as your last resort, because once you get on it, you will likely be persuaded by your psychiatrist to continue them pretty much indefinitely. P.S. I got another psychiatrist to help me taper."

While I know I have not reached an effective dose I wanted to share some strange side effects. I have a persistent cough that started first week. Second week in I had bowel irritability with diareah. Nausea, and restless sleep. I take 200mg of Trazadone to sleep and it is not working. I also take 900mg of lithium and 100 mg of Zoloft. Hopefully I will be able to get off of the lithium and Zoloft when I am up to full titration of Lamictal. My depression is already lifting. Lamictal seems to be working better than lithium or Zoloft ever have. Persist in finding your happiness. Those that find it hold it precious and have far more gratitude for happiness than those who did not have to work for it. We are far stronger than all of the ""normal"" folks."

Lamictal alone didn't fully control the absence seizures, but it ended the constant excruciating headache that had plagued me for years. Now, I take its generic (400 mg daily) in combination with generic equivalent of Keppra (2500 mg daily). The two have virtually eliminated the absence seizures. Adequate rest, limited work on a computer, taking the medication every 12 hours (not 11 or 13, etc. and avoiding strobe lights have also been helpful. I had issues with leg convulsions, but these have subsided. I think one or both medicines have caused/increased depression...still a small price to pay for the ability to continue my career."

After a couple of months I was at 300mg/day and have been for almost 2 years now without even one depressive or hypo-manic episode. I am a normal person and except for taking the medication 2x a day and refilling it once a month I don't even think about the fact that I am a person who struggles with Bipolar Disorder. The only think Lamictal has not helped me with is that I go back and forth between Bulimia and Anorexia. This started with the BP but I continue to struggle.

My body is very sensitive to meds so finding a good one took a lot of trial and error. Most upset my stomach, some gave me blurred vision or migraines. Seroquel made me feel like a zombie. I'd wander around, staring into space. I lost track of time, my mom had to put me to bed when I couldn't find my room. Some side effects were much more serious. Zoloft made me want to kill/hurt myself. On Prozac I attempted suicide. I tried to go it alone and see if I could control my mood swings. Instead, I lost my job, boyfriends, and put stress on my friends and family. I had to give it one more shot. My Dr. chose Lamictal 5 yrs ago, and I'm much more stable. I didn't feel those bad side effects. It's not perfect, I have my days but i think this medicine may have saved my life. We've tried different doses but now I take 150mg/day.

I've had these headaches (still do) from morning until nighttime for four years already. The moment I was prescribed a 50 mg dose of Lamotrigine (Lamictal), within fifteen minutes, my headaches were alleviated for the very first time. My dosage is currently 100 mg daily, in order to further alleviate the intensity of the headaches; they remain, though at a negligible level. Occasionally they intensify, but the migraines aren't constant anymore. The pills have exacerbated the convulsions on my legs, however. I had merely one convulsion in my four years of being ill before taking Lamictal. Now I may have one every month."

Once Lamictal and Trazodone were added, my state of severe depression slowly lifted. I did have an episode of hypomania at 200mg. When my dosage was increased to 300mg, I slowly began to stabilize. I did have some dizziness in the beginning but that didn't last long. I have not had any weight gain or loss while on this medication.

I thought I had the flu until I developed a rash after 4 days of the fever. I read the prescribing info (I'm a medical professional) and found in the black box warnings that fever and lymphadenopathy can precede a rash or occur without a rash as signs of hypersensitivity (allergy). My doctor did not tell me this, and I had never heard it before. I had to stop it and take high dose steroids to get the reaction to subside.

Diagnosis was changed to BP II and started on Lamictal. After stopping the Lexapro, the mania remissed totally and I have never felt better in my entire life. I am even-keeled, calm, focused, with no depression. I have virtually no side effects and am virtually symptom free. The only symptom I have recognized is difficulty sleeping, which the doctor has me on Seroquel for."
10/26/2009 7:05:36 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Borderline Personality Disorder Report ,"I'm 19 and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder last year. Lamictal has been my first ""mood stabilizing"" drug. I've had issues with attempting to ""self-medicate"" myself in order to feel better, so it was a big plus that Lamitcal has no risk for abuse I've been on Lamictal 50mg (very small dose) for about 5 months and I've definitely seen an improvement in my mood swings, depression, paranoia, anxiety and impulsivity. I still have mood swings but they are so much less severe. I feel a lot more in control in stressful situations and I can actually think rationally instead of just acting on my emotions. I did have insomnia for a few days after I started it, but that's the only negative side effect I've had."

To make a long story short, I sought medication again and began to take Lamictal about a year ago. At first I got a lot of acne all over my body, and I began to sweat like crazy ( symptoms my doctor had never heard of). I went back to Tegretol, and 9 months later decided to try Lamictal again. The symptoms have subsided drastically, and I feel like a monkey in a banana farm. However, I realize that not all people have the same reaction to different medication. My suggestion is, if you are taking something that is not working for you, try Lamictal and see what happens. You might feel like a monkey in a lab experiment, or find a banana farm of your own."

We noted good changes in mood stability and my ability to identify real vs not real emotions. About a year ago, i wanted to decrease the celexa 20 down to 10 due to sexual side effects. My doctor increase my to 200 of Lamictal. This combo is awesome. I believe I am finally ""growing out"" of BPD. I was able to stop counseling and identify my moods. What a great drug. The generic is awfully difficult to swallow though."

I discovered it lowers your potassium, messing up your electrolytes. So, I went to the store and got Morton's subsitute salt since it is pure potassium chloride. I made my own pills (got empties at the health food store) Each pill held roughly 500 mill of the salt. I took 5 of these every morning for the first two weeks of witdrawl, now I am down to 4 for the next two weeks and so on lowering one pill every two weeks until I am done. So, doing this, I have eliminated the physical side effects by 90%!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am actually able to get off of it without feeling like death. I wanted to share this because you will not find this info many places. I told my MD Naturopath what was going on and she said it makes sense that pottassium would help and that my dosage was safe."

For 20 years I've tried about 12 different antidepressants with different combinations, and never felt any significant relief. I was about to give up, thinking that nothing would ever help me. Once I added 25 Mg then 50 Mg of Lamictal with 90 Mg of Cympalta, and 30 Mg of Remeron at night, my mind blocks out from the hellish nightmare of living 24/7, dwelling the worst thoughts possible, obsessing, worrying, anxiety, suicide, wishing death, helplessness, hoplessness, etc. Finally RELIEF! I'm able to get through the day with a clear head, and able to wake up each morning without a panick attack with suicidal thoughts. I've even been able to lower my xanax use.

After two months I was rushed to the hospital with an allergic reaction which was later determined lamictal was the cause. I developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and was treated in the burn unit and ICU for a total of 2 weeks. I have multiple long-term complications such as scarring of nearly all of my skin, and mucous membranes, loss of vision etc. If you are taking this mediaction and notice swelling of your lymph glands, low grade fever notify your doctor. i experienced those symtoms 2-3 weeks prior to the obvious skin rash breakout and swelling, and was told it was the flu, I was informed later it was possibly the initial symptoms of SJS."

I still have about 20 absence seizures a day with my Lamictal. It also made me a little slow. I've also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, so it's never helped me at all in that department. Not to mention I've vomited several times because the taste is disgusting!! If you've ever let it stay in your mouth a little too long you know exactly what I'm talking about."

Throughout treatment the side effects just got worse and worse and I was expecting them to dissipate. I always woke up in a ""rush"", had tremors, and was prone to having tantrums and outbursts. Once I tried 100 mg, I had the WORST day ever. I felt like I was coming off of heroin or something; I totally felt out-of-body, sick, panicked, and like my personality was stolen. I waned off of it as fast as I could and I feel a lot better off of it. It also binds to the melanin in the eye which is kinda disconcerting to me. Anyway, it did NOT help whatsoever and actually made things worse. Not recommended."

I'm also on Prozac which helps as well. I found that when I increased Lamictal by 25 mg every 2 weeks I got headaches for a couple days thereafter. The headaches went away but they were pretty bad in the beginning. It may also be affecting my ability to lose weight, but i'm not 100% sure about that. I'm currently up to 100 mg and it's working VERY WELL for me, my mood swings are so infrequent compared to before."

The first few days I notice more irratibility and compulsive behavior. Both have eased either due to my attention to them or they simply faded. I have seen a significant relief in my depression. The hopelessnes and gloom and doom have faded. I am looking forward to upping the dose to see if the relief continues. I realize that side effects are bad, but the suffering I was feeling during my bouts of depression were much worse. I now don't wake up feeling the day is going to be bad and I can eat my lunch.

About 1/2 hour after I took my dose (and it's a low dose at the beginning), I felt a relaxation response start at the top of my head and down my spine, like a big giant ""whew, that's so much better"". I didn't even particularly feel bodily tension, but my anxiety level was always really high. I have been on for about 18 months now, and still have good mood stabilization."
6/14/2009 12:18:26 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I had tried a number of other meds, without success. Either the side effects were too overwhelming (Zyprexa) or the medication itself was ineffective (Seroquel and many others), that I had basically resigned myself to a lifetime of struggle with Bipolar Disorder. I was trialed on the lowest dose of Lamictal (25mg? - it's been 3 years and I can't specifically remember the initial dose). After titrating up to about 75mg, I began to see a marked improvement. The highest dose I took was 450mg/day, however, at my body weight (115 lbs), I was having difficulty with dizziness and nausea and backed off to 400mg. Now, 3 years after starting Lamictal, I take a daily dose of 300mg. I have zero side effects (at least, notable ones). I have not had any severe manic episodes, and, in general, I feel the best that I have in 5 years. I hope others have a psychiatrist as insightful as mine and have the opportunity to give this treatment a try."
6/1/2009 10:29:25 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"This medication does not work right away like asprin. It's silly to take it one day or one month and decide if it does or does not work. You need to take Lamictal long term and over the course of a year you can tell whether or not it delays depression. Lamictal is not a quick fix and if you take it a few days or a week (or for anxiety) you're not helping yourself of giving the medication a chance to work. Lamictal changed my life, but only after months and months did I realize I was less depressed. It's NOT an anti-depressant. It DELAYS depression."

They continued to get worse and more frequent. I was referred to a neurologist and Lamictal was a miracle drug for me. I have taken it for 6 years and have had only the aura.

I find myself feeling like a zombie and I can't remember anything short term. I find most of my outbursts come on because I feel so helpless and out of control that I snap... I say really harsh things that I so whole heartedly regret saying afterward. My Dr. now wants to put me on an anti psychotic so I will be even more medicated.

Hang in there, folks!"
3/1/2009 10:26:36 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar Disorder NOS Report ,"I was on 25 mgs of lamictal for two weeks. Days 3-10, I felt a lot better than usual. What was most amazing was I remarkably -calm-. I am usually very irritable and have a short fuse but while taking lamictal all that was gone. Unfortunately, I had major, major side effects from taking it. I had a huge problem concentrating. I felt really out of it, like I was not like in my body. Dissociation, if you want to be technical, I suppose. I also had major joint aches. My bones ached and cracked constantly. And if that isn't enough, I started losing my hair. That would be normal maybe for someone older, but I am 17 and it was definitely due to the med. After discontinuing lamictal and letting my body readjust itself, I probably only had a third of the hair I used to have. And what was left was quite limp and coarse for a long time. Surprisingly, though, I never got the infamous lamictal rash."
2/6/2009 4:19:17 AM,3 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I was prescribed Lamictal for depression and anxiety (along with a traditional antidepressant I was already taking). While I did not feel that it was really effective for anxiety, I felt it was a good antidepressant. In fact when the other drug was dropped for other reasons, I remember thinking that Lamictal was a good alternative, especially at a higher dose of 300-400mg. Unfortunately, It had the side effect of reduced cognitive abilities and ""word finding"" (hesitation coming up with the right way to say something). I read that this happens in some people, although not everyone. These were lessened with reduced dosage but at the cost of it's depression fighting ability. I would recommend Lamictal, esspecially if you have tried other medications before, with that caution."

12/23/2008 8:21:51 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"I started taking Lamictal about 14 months ago. It is a lifesaver as it helps to control my moods. I have absolutely no side effects unlike other meds i have tried and there are no mandatory blood tests. Before I was on it I was cycling about twice a month and suicidal. It quiets my mood swings (except for the occasional ""breakthrough mood"") in combination with the other meds i take (Neurontin, buspar, risperdal, and Fish oil) It did take about a month to start working as the doses were titrated up. That has been my only issue with it that it takes so long to get proper doses of it. Because of this, it wasnt a great option for my acute symptoms but it is still good. I took 150MG per day for about 9 months but have been on 200MG per day for about the last month."

Lamictal has cured my chronic fatigue, I am finally able to concentrate and think more clearly. I have energy all day, before Lamictal I was always too tired to even do basic daily activities like grocery shop, clean house, or bath. Lamictal has cured my binge eating and I have lost about 5 pounds. I am so productive now and actually doing all those small things I was too depressed to do. I also take 150mg of Wellbutrin with the Lamictal. note: other drugs I have tried. I have tried Lexepro and Paxil but SSRI's make me even more depressed, suicidal, and psychotic.

I am experiencing indigestion (which I've never had much of) about 75% of the time--even when I sleep. I am also very nauseated and dizzy. I've tried taking it with food, milk, starches, Pepto Bismol & ginger. I take it at night and am waiting for the sedative qualities to kick in.

As far back as I can remember I have had bouts of depression and threw gigantic fits. I always tried to be good, but no matter what I just couldn't. I was very rebellious and angry with my family all the time and occasionally with peers. I finally was diagnosed at the end of July because after a huge blow up I realized I had a problem. My doctor suggested Lamictal as my first option since it has the least negative side effects. I have been on 200 mg for a week and I have noticed extreme benefits. I am motivated to do things such as exercise and eating healthy. The only complaint I have about Lamictal is a bit of insomnia. I wake up several times during the night. I can always fall back asleep but sometimes it takes awhile. I also have started having very vivid dreams since I started the 200mg. Its not really a bad thing just a wierd thing lol."

He takes 400 mg a day, and has zero side effects. I hear Lamictal is supposed to make you gain weight, but my husband has trouble keeping weight on. He takes no other regular prescriptions, although he keeps Ativan available when he is experiencing high anxiety. Lamitctal is excellent at keeping my husband out of deep, deep depressions, but it does little with manic episodes. If you have regular, sever maniac episodes (BPI people!), I would recommend speaking with your doctor about additional prescriptions you could use in conjunction with Lamictal. If my husband hadn't been placed on Lamictal, I doubt we would have gotten married. Four years and strong!"

I am on my second month of taking this med and am feeling more stable than ever. I feel very blessed for being given this considering all the ones other doctors have put me on. I only take it twice a day with a risperdal at bedtime. I have had doctors give me up to five different meds, strong ones to. I am very sensitve to meds and don't seem to need very much as far as high dosages go. I for the first time want to give a shout for something I have been blessed with. I was taking to much for a week, began to get too high strung so I cut it back and am feeling great as far as the bipolar goes. Finally, I can believe there is a heaven on earth!"

All the while, doctors tried out every drug imaginable... lithium, depakote, wellbutrin, topamax, prozac, lexapro. Finally, when I was ready to give up, a new doctor prescribed Lamictal. At last, I feel like a normal person. I have no mood swings. I never get depressed, never feel suicidal, and never swing into crazy manic episodes. No side effects. It's a miracle.

I lost weight on lamictal. overall I was happy Then I woke up one morning with a rash. I know there is a fatal rash that accompanies lamictal. I am currently waiting for my neuro to call. Mine is small, in the back of my neck and has all these little bumps (I felt them which is how I knew I had the rash). It doesn't itch but it burns a little bit. I know this med causes different kinds of rashes. I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced this? How did it start (size, appearance) What did it look like? Has anybody gotten ""The Rash"" (SJS)?

The first week I was feeling some relief with my emotions and depressions. Finished up the 50mg pills and have felt worse. Moods cycling at the drop of a dime. Increased suicidial thoughts. Tearful, not sleeping as well. Just started the 100mg dose and the first day seemed to be a small improvement. Found out that on the FDA website Jan 08 this med was shown to have increased suicidal ideation which freaked me out. So I am just trying to keep that in mind when I start to have those thoughts. One thing I have noticed today with the 100mg dose is irritable and short tempered. I am just very frustrated. I have never been one to be able to take much medication due to side effects. Since Lamictal I have noticed very heavy menstration with clotting, and cramping, increased pimples, and the depression and tearfulness.

After having tried a number of BPII meds, the off-label use of Lamictal (250mg/day) has helped a lot. I still have some episodes at this level (crying, down, etc), but I don't want to up it yet. Side effects: a bit of drowsiness, word finding trouble, and a tad slower mentally. But better to be a bit less intelligent, but a lot happier. The journey continues..."

3/2/2008 2:15:50 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar Disorder NOS Report ,"I am schizotypal more than bipolar, but DMS-IV labels are pretty much just unscientific stigmatizing labels, so you better understand my condition I have a unordinary cognitive module that drives my mind into chaos, usually within itself, and is now chaotic but usefull. I expect the chaos to wind down as the dose is titrated up, but I'm getting weary as the anxiety and feelings of panic have gotten worse every day since I started taking it, and my vision is mentally altered to where objects seem larger and more hostile than usual. In any case, it's more pleasant and safer than anti psychotics and other mood stabilizers like lithium and depakote, and isn't as sense killing as the benzodiazapines so I'll give it a shot and hope I don't fall through the earth cause this is getting intense, but at the same time when the fear subsides; it feels good."

I started with a 25mg dose and in about 6 weeks reached 150mg. It was a bit too high, headache and nausea, the nausea being unacceptable. I dropped dosage down to 100mg nightly and am just fine. I did put on some weight and some fatigue is a bit of a factor. The only other side effect is that I am sleeping and actually rememering my dreams. I had to laugh at them they were pretty vivid. Not disturbing but there were certainly there."

A specialist told me she felt it was totally PTSD with my history of violent incidents which I swept under the brain carpet. Once I started to research PTSD I knew that was my problem - the jumpiness and flashbacks. I take 20mg Prozac with 2 x 25mg Lamictal a day. I took it very easy with getting to the right dose of Lamictal and had some itchy sensations to begin with, but no rash. Within a few weeks the itchies went away by themselves, as did headaches. I am now side effect free, flashback free and feel close to being my old self. It is so trial and error for everyone, but after many years of trying I have my answer. Good luck."

Never want to go through that again. I started lamictal in November 2007. The titration period was hell, honestly doubted if I was ever going to get relief. Finally got up to 200mg about three weeks ago, and started feeling subtle improvement in my mood. Now I can honestly say that I feel normal again, and the depression is gone. No side effects.

I'm still at 25mg and my mood has not had any improvements. However, I feel very foggy during the day. And lately, I've started getting extremely agitated. (As someone with an incredible amount of patience, this is quite unusual). I've had some moments of severe confusion, (I wandered around a store aimlessly for nearly an hour). Even though I'm on Adderall for ADD and it's always done wonders for my concentration, on Lamitcal, I find it very hard to clear my mind enough to get anything done. I'm debating whether or not to discontinue this med. Having had so many failed treatments, I really hoped Lamictal would be the answer to my problems. A part of me wants to believe the side effects will clear up. But as of right now, I feel better off of it than on."

I am taking 150mg once/ day in the a.m. I have had no side effects. I took about 4-6 weeks for this to really start working and before I started to feel better. In my opinion I feel It has really helped me. It has helped stabilize my moods far more than another mood stabilizer or Bipolar med I have tried. I have tried- Depakote, Tegretol, Geodon, Topamax, Seroquel. I have also been on numerous antidepressants. I still remain on Effexor but since I started the Lamictal my dose of Effexor has been cut in half. My depressions have lessoned a great deal. I can handle difficult situations that may arise in my life much more easily. My thoughts are better. I am no longer dwelling on things which are out of my control. I love this medication.

I moved to 300 to help my irritabilty and noticed side effects, my mouth would go numb about 5 minutes after I took it and last for about 1/2 hour or so I would get really sick if I didn't take it at the same time every day. I moved to 400, I was still very irritated and getting depressed some mania. A half hour before the normal time I take my pill I get a feeling of being detached from my body and the world around me. I start feeling a sick like being car sick This gets worse and worse if I don't take my pill directly at 1pm, I get dizzy really sick I almost passed out at work the day after going up on the dose and was 10 minutes off from my normal time!

Have tried various drugs (mostly anti-deps which just drive my mania through the roof) in a day or two over the past 3 years. Lamictal worked great for 10 days - crystal clear thoughts, good energy level. And then I became s*l, and the clarity of thought went out the window.

12/2/2007 12:26:18 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"I was put on Lamictal for severe depression correlating to bipolar disorder. Initially I had headaches, lasting about a week, following each increase in dose, which were annoying, but bearable. Lamictal certainly stabilizes my mood. I never cry unless intoxicated and I'm never really happy. My blunted emotional reactions still surprise me. This dulled down version of myself is certainly preferable to self-hatred and extreme depression, but I miss my highs. I notice cognitive impairment, inability to find the word I'm looking for, and inability to complete thoughts. I also feel that Lamictal makes me extremely fatigued all the time. Adding Adderall to help with cognitive impairment & lack of energy has helped me innumerably, and the two seem to be an extremely promising combination. Lamictal also made me stop smoking marijuana, as the two do not interact well, causing extreme anxiety and paranoia. Overall, Lamictal probably saved my life."

I tend to have chronic severe depressive episodes with my BP2. Maintaining stability takes a constant effort. Within a month or so of starting Lamictal, several people commented on how much more ""grounded"" I appeared... first time I'd ever had other people notice & point out an obvious improvement (been on almost 20 different meds, dealing with psych issues since childhood). I still have symptoms, but intensity, frequency and duration have lessened. I do have side effects that I believe are related to Lamictal, including mild-moderate acne, occassional back /joint pain/discomfort, and trouble finding the right word sometimes. For several months, I experienced hairloss ... a deal-breaker for me if it hadn't stopped. Overall benefits outweigh side effects of this particular medication for me."

I have talked to a doctor about these symtoms just days before I started the 100mg dose and have been told that my symptoms are most likely from stress. My thought on that feedback is.....WTF...????? So far, I do not feel that the Lamictal is helping me at all. I do not have insurance and the cheapest monthly cost for this drug is about $200.00 to $230.00. And I got those prices from Walmart and Meijers. I have already asked the doctor to try something different due to the fact that the cost is more then I can afford, but I have been told that I have not been taking the full dose long enough to establish whether or not it will help me. So right now I have no choice but wait...I guess. Right now my feelings are that I would not recommed this drug for Bipolar ll Disorder."

The last of Depakote was in January.Depakote caused weight gain. The Lamictal doesn't control my depression. I quit Cymbalta in June and was able to sleep for the first time in months, and my depression got temporarily better. It was like being let out of prison. That lasted about a week. I am also on Topomax from my neurologist for migraines. My psychiatrist doesn't seem to know anything about it being used for bipolar. He also didn't seem to know that Lamictal is less effective when you take birth control pills, which accounted for my rapid cycling and nearly suicidal thoughts in June before I quit them and felt better 3 weeks later. I take 350 mg now, and he keeps upping the dose. I want to add Wellbutrin to the mix but he won't, saying it might cause mania. Well, you can't up the dose to infinity.

My mood has been improved with a major reduction in crying episodes, improved ability to concentrate without racing thoughts. I hope I can continue with the treatment.

9/7/2007 3:01:47 AM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"Lamictal is a pain to start because dosage must be increased very slowly to reduce the chance of the rare-but-fatal rash, so it takes a while to reach therapeutic results. The side effects have been very mild for me, and it has eliminated my manias and reduced the length and occurence of my hypomanias. My depressions are less severe and the length of time I am suicidal has decreased, but I still experience depressions and suicidal ideation, so my psychiatrist and I are discussing trying lithium. I am disappointed Lamictal did not work better for me, because I'm very apprehensive about the side effects associated with other mood stabilizers.

I am now on 300 mg a day.Lastyear I could not afford the lamictal so for a short period of time I had to take tegretol. When I returned to the lamictal at the same dosage I had been on for almost a year, my sexual desire completely diminished. I still feel balanced but I am unhappy with the impotence. I haven't found anywhere where the lamictal has that side effect, so I can't blame the drug. The other side effects I get are numbness of the mouth approximately 10 minutes after taking my dosage."

The only downside is the side effects. My pharmicist says this is unheard of, but I get extremely dizzy from this and cannot take more than 100 mg at one time, so I have to split this up three times a day. If I take 125+mg at one time, I have trouble standing up and my head will feel like there is a lot of pressure on it for a minute or so after I stand and that was a pretty big problem."

I went back down to 150 mg. when I was put on another medicine that enhanced the effects of the Lamictal, and I stayed at that dose when I went off of the other medication a week later.

It dissolves very quickly and the taste is unbearably bitter - impossible to swallow once you're above 25mg. I've solved this problem by buying gel caps, crushing the pills and filling the gel caps. I take 200mg which will fit in two size '3' gel caps. You do have to be careful about increasing your dose slowly and watch for rashes which indicate a life threatening reaction to the drug."

I am already on Lithium, Wellbutrin, Inderol, Trileptal and Klonopin (as needed, which is maybe 2x a month). I wish to be on as few meds at as low a dose as possible. Very afraid to try EMPower Plus (even though I bought it and it sits in my fridge). Very afraid for my physical health, psychological health, physiological brain health. Recovering from a manic/psychotic episode is like recovering from a brain injury for me. I am slow, sluggish, dopey for weeks afterward. I am afraid that one day, my brain is just not going to come back. But Lamictal has been really great for alot of people, so if you can't get your depression swings under control, do your research (www.crazymeds.org/com) and decide."

After my p-doc bumped my dose up to 125, I prompted got into a fight with someone in a drug store over NOTHING!!! I turned into a misogynist and would have as little to do with anyone with possible. These side effects, as well as severe acne, dropping stuff, tripping over stuff, and running into walls, etc., escalated with increasing doses. I noticed swollen glands at 150mgs. These weren't there at 100mgs. In 2/07 I was put on 300mg Wellbutrin and 100mg Lamictal and was one relatively happy camper. My idiot doctor wants to put me on 200mg Lamictal and take me completely off the Wellbutrin. I mentioned the swollen glands to him and he immediately mentioned ""oh, that's not medication-related."" Every site I read indicates that you should see your doctor IMMEDIATELY if you have, among other things including the rash, SWOLLEN GLANDS. Stupid doctor thought it was nothing. Oh, yeah - my eyesight is f****d up as well. Needless to say, I've taken it upon myself to decrease my dose and I'm getting another doctor.

I wonder if the Prozac contributes to the odd hypomanic days I have - perhaps I should wean off of it now that the depression side has been stabilized for about 3 months. For days when I feel hypomanic, pdoc instructed me to take some Zyprexa (5 mg) on those days - helps bring me down & sleep better."

I currently have to take Nexium/Prilosec to treat GERD. I am not sure if the GERD is caused by the Lamactil, or if it is something else. I also had this problem when I took Trileptal. I do read that one of the side effect is heart burn, but doesn't say anything about GERD. As far as the treatment of the med goes, I do find myself being more impulsive. If something crosses my mind, it will be taken care of or I won't sleep kind of thing. I do find myself lost in social situations, because sometimes I say things that shouldn't have been said because of the impulsiveness. I am able to hold down a full time job and finish school because of this and trileptal. I do recommend for those who are going thru school to add an antipsychotic (abilify, risperdal) because you will find it hard be motivated to do homework. I do enjoy not being cloudy and hazy all the time. I do seem to be in a trance sometimes when something emotional comes up, and I don't respond appropriately."

I cycle not as often as I would without it, but when I do it's very intense. I also still have problems with finding words to say in conversations and have to really try to concentrate to get some easy tasks done at times.

At that time the 100mg didn’t work so well for me.1) got a rash on face; 2) went from sleeping great to not at all; and 3) felt I started to become hypo-manic (ie, racing thoughts, not sleeping, wanting to spend again).We decided to bring me down to 75mg/day (3 x 25mg, @night).After 1 week I started falling into dark depression, anger was back, & wanted to sleep alot.So I dosed up to 100mg again but this time taken as 50mg twice a day, hoping the divided dose would help w/the insomnia & face rash.This is what I found when I divided the 100mg up into 50mg 2x/day: the hypomania (racing thoughts, spending) did not come back and the insomnia diminished. so in this regard dividing the dose helped eliminate those side-effects/issues.However, the facial rash came back & worsened w/ each dose.I stopped taking it completely to get rid of the rash (& used cortisone cream). Rash went away (again). I spoke w/ my Dr. & we are going to at least keep me on 25mg twice a day (total 50mg/day) since I had no issues at that dose(& it was helping) & then try & add something else like topamax or zyprexa or geodon, etc. Will keep you posted on what happens."

Since starting Lithium I have not had a manic episode, but I have been hospitalized 4 times in the past 2 years for depression. In the fall, after a long hospital stay, my doctor was considering ECT. But instead she put me on Lamictal and it pulled me out of the depression. It has been over 4 months and I am still asymptomatic. It's not that long, I know, but for me its a long time. I am so happy with what this drug has done. Besides relieving my depression, it has brought greater stability to my life. And while a number of people gain weight while taking it, I have lost weight.

While it helped with depression somewhat, it was ineffective for mania, even after two months of treatment. I switched to Depakote and began feeling better after only two days. Plus, the Depakote had far fewer side effects than the Lamictal. For those two months on Lamictal, I had horrible insomnia that didn't stop until I discontinued."
12/8/2006 9:59:01 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"It was good while it lasted I had some reservations about starting Lamictal. I read about that rash and I was terrified. It took me a year to actually convince myself to try it. Once I did, I felt silly for waiting so long. It was great! No side effects AT ALL...for a while. I take it with Wellbutrin and Klonopin (and as of last night Topamax). 2 weeks into it I developed a rash across my chest and I thought, oh well, this is the beginning of the end. However, that was as far as it went, so I continued the treatment. I started VERY slowly. I started at 12.5 mg (1/2 a 25 mg tablet) for 2 weeks and increased by 12.5 mg every 2 weeks until I got to 50 mg. Then I started increasing by 50 mg until I got up to 200 mg. My cycling stopped. Period. I was in La-la Land. I didn't have any of the brain fuzziness or anything. The only thing I noticed was trouble every now and then with word recall. No big deal to me. It's not like I'm writing a philosophical dissertation or anything. A couple of months went by and I started noticing mixed episodes. I brushed them off, thinking no med was going to take care of all my symptoms all the time. Then irritation led to rage. Before I knew it, I was yelling and screaming at my kids all the time and was constantly pissed at my husband. The thing that did it for me was the other night, I had a scary depression. I was planning suicide and was about to injure myself. I know this may sound cheesy, but writing what I was feeling in my journal helped. I also wrote how my death would affect the people around me, my kids, my husband, my mom having to bury one of her kids. It woke me up enough to know I needed help. My pdoc heard from me the next day. So although I loved the Lamictal while it lasted, it lacks the staying power that I need as an ultradian rapid cycler."

I have tried dozens and dozens of others, with little or no results. I have been on Lamictal for approx 5 years. The only side effect that bothers me is that I quite often have problems with my balance and coordination. Also, if I miss a dose, even for a day, I get the sick withdrawl symptoms. I've had rashes on occasion, but not serious. There are times when my skin itches also, but overall, definitely worth tolerating to get the benefits of the drug. It made me quite tired and fatigued so my Dr. split my dose to 200 mg twice a day. He also added Adderall to help keep me awake. Not able to ever get the Rx filled as a generic, and it's pretty expensive. Overall, very happy."

My symptoms seemed not to match up very well with the diagnoses, unless the majority were energetic 'agitation'. My dose of Prozac increased over time from 20 mg to 80 mg. Somehow, it did not seem to be helping. I switched p-docs, and was diagnosed with Bipolar NOS (although likely II) last month. I do not have any sort of ""lamictal rash"". In fact, it seems to be greatly abbreviating the range in which my moods swing. I do not get as irritated, nor as depressed, and what a difference.

It was odd at first, but not because of the medication or side effects, but because being stabile felt ""uncomfortable"". I'd had ups and downs since I was a teen, so being level wasn't something that I was used to. I don't think I will ever stop taking the Lamictal. Topamax added to it at a low dose also stops the increased appetite and weight gain. In fact, I was able to get down to my ideal weight. I am also on Abilify and Zoloft. I have been phased off of a few others because with the increase in the dosage of Lamictal, I no longer need them. I'm not even on the Topamax any longer. The next to go is the Zoloft.

With the withdrawals from the Geodon and only the Wellbutrin I was really irritable, easily frustrated, and easily pissed off... and then literally fuming (couldn't let it go after) most of the time. Pdoc put me on a mood stabilizer, Lamictal. I titrated up as directed with 25mg for 2 weeks and 50mg for 2 weeks. During that time, I had some mild to medium headaches- that would last throughout the day and even through the night; I would go to bed with a headache and strangely enough, also wake up with the headache. I was real itchy for some of this time, mainly on my scalp (like bugs crawling, mosquito bite itchy), but no signs of rash. During the titration period, the Lamictal did nothing to calm me down and even me out. I was probably even more agitated. Seems I read somewhere (psyched.org?) that Lamictal is more activating and therefore more useful for depression and leveling out from there, which I never seem to have to the full degree. Dr. Phelps on that site recommends Trileptal for the agitated bipolar.... In addition to the Lamictal, the Wellbutrin is activating too, so I was a walking timebomb, waiting to bite the head off my boss or my wife and kids or any other driver on the road. I also was sleeping poorly with getting up several times throughout the night and then getting up very early (not intentionally). In addition to the headaches, I occasionally have had REALLY bad neckaches for days on end-so much so that it would wake me up frequently at night! Tylenol/ Ibuprofen/ Alleve would only help a little bit. The neck aches are bad enough that I can barely turn my head to drive and can't lift it upwards very far. The Pdoc indicated I should have seen some beneficial effects in the 1st 4 weeks even at just 50mgs and so has me titrating back down. Update: Tapering was only 1 week back on"

This drug tended to increase manic symptoms and anxiety. I felt like a chicken with it's head cut off, responding to every thought in my head and acting on it. I tried depakote again, and realized that's a much better drug for me because I'm calm and in control. My advice to others is that just because it works for other people doesn't mean it will work for you. Don't try to ""fit in"" with your health. There's a big difference between the way you *think* you should feel and how you actually feel. As a result I stayed on this drug was longer than I should have. Knowing how I actually feel is a difficult thing for me, and that's why they have pdocs/shrinks to be a sounding-board for how you feel. Also, I recommend that people try to AVOID reading remedyfind.com or anything else you find on the internet BIAS how you respond to the drug.

I was on 50mg of Lamictal when I started having serious suicidal ideation and started shaving my pills down to decrease the dosage slowly. It precipitated a mixed manic episode the day I saw my pdoc and the next day I went inpatient to the psych hospital and was taken off Lamictal. It seems to have a rage component with me but in the deepest darkest hours of my bipolar depressions I wish I would have saved some Lamictal b/c I would take some. I had absolutely no side effects. No rash, nothing. If you call the rage a side effect then I guess I did have a side effect, don't know. My pdoc doesn't prescribe it to me anymore. Maybe in another combination of meds it would work fine but alone it caused rage and with Geodon did also and with Geodon and Lithium together it still did. It was expensive though even with insurance the copay was over $40. I like this med. Don't let the chance of the rash scare you away from it. Not everyone gets it."

Although Lamotrigine compares favourably to Depakote in terms of hair thinning, 6% of ppl on askapatient.com reported hair loss/thinning, thats high enough for me to link it to my thinning hair. Sooo, since having come off lamotrigine i've been able to review how effective it was for me. Lamotrigine gave me mood swings (!), made me agressive at times, tearful, and I don't think it lifted my depression. I felt MORE unstable if anything (weird but some epileptics have reported it causing mood problems). Its odd but I still have a feeling it somehow helped, praps coz it POSSIBLY lessened the mental fatigue/overstimulation I often feel. Or, praps more likely, due to all the glowing reports I read about it, so i'm trying to persuade myself it did help...when in fact the actual evidence generally points to it not really having done much. I'm confused to be honest! Approx 10 weeks: I think its stabilised my mood somewhat, I don't seem to hate myself/attack myself as much as previously. However, still a bit depressed. Hard to assess the lamotrigine in isolation as I have just recently been diagnosed with Androgenetic Alopecia (which is an awful thing, especially for a woman) and i'm unsure as to Lamotrigines contribution to this. I have looked on 'askpatient' website and 5% of people reported hair loss, 10% reported acne (have this too). So as a result i'm weaning myself down (hopefully not off as I do think it helps). Have gone down from 200 to 100 a couple of days ago. Day 55: Almost out of the danger zone, which is 2 - 8 weeks apparently (re Rash). Not sure if its doing anything as lately i've been traumatised by my hair thinning. Has anyone else had this as a result of lamotrigine?? Please email if so!

I do feel myself sliding downward the last few weeks. I live in Canada and I find the winters very hard. I struggle more with depression than mania. I was taking it with lexapro but turned into a slug and gained 15lbs. I have tried just about every anti depressant so I have decided to add natural supplements to the lamictal.

The last two and a half years I used every medication that was on the market except for the anti-depressants. I took haldol, seroquel, zyprexa, abilify, geodon, risperdal etc...Nothing worked as expected. Two gave me major weightgain, others would give me crazy anxiety and with some i would feel totally numb. Now for the lamictal, i take 200 mg in the morning and finally i feel okay. After two and a half years searching for the right med i finally found one that really works. No significant weightgain (like 4 pounds) I started doing a little bit of fitness and lost the 4 pounds in one week of excercising. So weightgain is not an issue.

This drug can produce side effects at higher doses than it does at the lower ones. Also my psychiatrist did not advise me to titrate up to the 300 mg dose and I'm sure the suddenness of the increase had something to do with experiencing the nausea and vomiting (uncontrolled without medication) at the higher dose."

I've lost all the weight I had put on with Zyprexa and have a lot of energy again. I still take 1,25 mg of Zyprexa if I get too hyped up, about every one or two weeks. I have the odd night when I can't go to sleep and take half a sleeping tablet (Midazolam 3.75mg) after an hour or two of trying. Happens about 1 or twice a month. Often I can overcome problems with falling asleep with visualizing a pretty landscape. My husband is very happy again since he suffered with me for about 15 years and through two stays in hospital (the cherry for him is having a sex life again), I'm patient with the kids, I hold down a part time job, I horse ride, play tennis, paint, play the piano and have a wide circle of friends.

It was great for 4 months (my normal hypo-mania phase normally lasts for 2 months), and the rest of the time felt a moderate depression, inabbility to focus at work, and fatigue. =========================================== I'm diagnosed as Bipolar II. Each phase is about 2-3 monthes long (2-3 up, 2-3 down). Horrible long depression periods.. Started 8 monthes ago at 25 mg a day, gradually increasing by 25 every week till 200 a day. At the begining I had some dizziness, headaches, pukes and fatigue. Also suffered of short-term MEMORY-LOSE! It was very embarrassing at work... Also started loosing some hair since using it. Some of these side-effects re-appear during depression phase. At the begining it has worked for 5 months, and I thought I've found the magic med for me, but then, started a MILD depression episode, though not that bad as before, but still disappointing. Due to my quit ""slow cycling"", I have to test it over longer period in order to have a better observation. Now increasing to 250 mg a day. Update - July 2006 ------------------- Still not helpfull. Very disappointed. Now I'm back to 100. I feel drugged during the morning, and my brain slowed down (I'm a software developer). At work it's noticeable that I function badly, and had a looooong depressive period, which breaks me apart. I don't know what shall I do. This search after the right solution is frustrating. I've lost weight and don't have energies to do anything. I'm glad for those of u who have found it working for u. Update - August 2006 -------------------- That's it. I quit taking this med.

Before it I tryed Amitryptiline Imipromine; Lithium; Nortryptiline Depakote; Prozac; and... several other antideperssant drugs for nearly 10 years[becoming hypomanic,one time manic,so haspitalised]. But LAMICTAL is another stuff,it eleminates deperssion completly without mania. Till now 12 months on it.No side effects;only itching on my legs and arms. So I reduced dosagae from 175 to 100; itching went away and then went up till 200.LAMICTAL changed all my personality aspects; like DEPRESSION, PARANOIA, LOW FUNCTIONING ; ;HYPOMANIA [have little some days but is not so bad. regulate it with low dose of ATIVAN.]; ANXIETY ; AGITATION.

I understand that it is quite expensive without insurance. I was afraid to try Lamictal at first because of the ""deadly rash"" warning. It took me quite awhile to get up the courage to try it, and I am grateful that I did. It has been an excellent mood stabilizer for me. For those considering Lamictal, it is important to understand that when you start, you are given very gradual increases in dosage over a pretty significant period of time (weeks). This enables your medical practitioner to monitor you for any of the side effects, including the ""deadly rash."" In addition to providing good stabilization of my bipolar symptoms, Lamictal has been an excellent antidepressant. An interesting issue: both my OB/GYN and my psychiatrist received a letter from the manufacturer of Lamictal stating that the use of Camila, a birth control pill prescribed for women over the age of 35 with a history of smoking (me!), reduces the efficacy of Lamictal. After consulting with both of my doctors we decided to discontinue the use of Camila. About four days later I started to feel wonderful! I hadn't realized I was in any way depressed because I'm so accustomed to feeling that way. It was an amazing transformation and I'm glad that the pharmaceutical company came clean about the drug interactions. I currently use Lamictal with Zyprexa and Klonopin as needed for anxiety. This combination of medications has kept me incredibly stable for over a year. If you are considering Lamictal and are afraid of the side effects, I would recommend giving it a try. As I mentioned, you will be monitored very carefully as you ramp up to the full dosage (200 mg)."

I was taking a large dose (1400 mg.) in order to be in therpeutic range, and I didn't like always getting blood levels checked. Also, if I was late with a dose, I started shaking and was a nervous wreck. Addictive, as far as I'm concerned. I'm up to 100 mg. of Lamictal, which in reality is only 50 mg. in my system, since the Tegretol & Lamictal bind to the same receptor site. My doc won't reduce the Tegretol until I'm at a therapeutic dose of Lamictal. The only side effect has been more energy, so I take it in the morning (helpful for my fibromyalgia & chronic fatigue syndrome.) So many of the ratings I've read have been positive, so I'm hoping it works for me, too. Maybe, I won't have to take another antidepressant, too, since I'm already on trazodone (for sleep (works great!) and an antidepressant.)

For the past three years I have been on and off various combinations of antidepressants and ADD medications. As of the beginning of August 2006, I was taking Wellbutrin, Zoloft and Trazodone (along with Adderall) and I still experienced days or weeks when just getting out of bed was an ordeal. But whenever the heavy black clouds lifted, I felt really good, and spent all my free time (and some work time!) on crossword puzzles, drawing illustrations for the children's book I wanted to write, acquiring and trying out all the best lures for big bass, knitting clothes for my niece, or on another of my multitude of hobbies (read: obsessions). If you asked me, I'd say I felt fine--but you'd never be able to ask me, because I'd bite the head off of anyone who dared to interrupt me. Since I felt so full of energy some of the time, it was hard to remember the days I was so sad and tired. But I knew something was still wrong, since my husband was hurt and resentful that I was constantly blowing him off or yelling at him (not that I ever noticed his feelings at the time). When I told my psychiatrist this, he brought up the possibility of Bipolar II, and said if I didn't improve in a month we should consider a mood stabilizer. Since the last thing I thought I needed was another Mental Health Diagnosis, I decided to really make an effort to pay attention to how I was feeling. I made a chart to track my moods, and goshdarnit if they weren't all over the place. And it wasn't even a bad month. So I started on Lamictal and dropped the Zoloft. It took 4 weeks to reach a therapeutic dose of 100 mg, but I noticed during the first week that I was more relaxed, patient, and engaged, and could actually stay that way for days at a time.

And hard to assess effectiveness I am 56 years old and have a 25 year history of bipolar spectrum (or bipolar II) and anxiety disorders with changing diagnoses and 5 hospitalizations for intractable depressions; twice including ECT. One course of ECT caused the fracturing of the C4 & C5 vertebra in mid course of 12 treatments. ECT trials were 15 years apart and not effective. I have also tried all classes of antidepressants,lithium,MAOIs, antipsychotics and now an anticonvulsant. In 1994 I quit psychiatric treatment and worked with an Osteopathic Physician versed in treating depression and an MD specializing in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia and for 8 years experienced significant improvement in my outlook and more energy with less pain. During this time I recovered the ability to engage in pleasurable activities. Using hydrocortisone, natural thyroid,Ultram, Meyers Cocktail IV's and supplements including high amounts of B vitamins, Omega 3 fish oil, St. John's Wort, minerals and niacinamide for high triglycides, etc.; unfortunately, the steroid use finally led to acute fungal and yeast infections and the regimen as a whole lost it's effect. I then experienced very severe anxiety and an unrelenting depressive episode that included hospitalization in 2004 and trying ECT again in 2005. This ECT resulted in having to have 3 cervical vertebra fused. I changed doctors to a Osteopathic Psychiatrist and after several unsuccessful antidepressant and antipsychotic trials she convinced me to try Lamictal. Her experience with a few patients and the approval by the FDA for lamotrigine use in increasing the interval of intervention in Bipolar I patients led her to recommend it. She also believes that it helps lift depression in some patients. I had suggested a compliance pact with her/that I would not discontinue use of a medication without agreement.

I'm diagnosed as Bipolar II rapid cycling and have had terrible mood swings since I was a teenager. These swings escalated during the years and I first crash landed at 35. Shortly after my 40th birthday I crash landed even harder and was hospitalized. Until my P-doc decided to put me on Lamictal nothing else had never really helped me to stabilize. When on Lamictal I was first put on 25mg but nothing happened. Then 50 mg, 100mg and 200mg (the dose increase was very slow and gentle). After reaching 200, nothing still happened. Then when my doc raised the dose to 400mg magic appeared! I take 400mg Lamictal in the morning (2x200) and 30mg Remeron at night. This combination works extremely well. Earlier in life I cycled several times a year, but since April 2005 I haven't had a single (abnormal) mood swing or even a minor mood bump. I have been on this treatment, at this dosage, for two years now and I now live my life as a normal human being. That sensation is fantastic. My family life works and I'm successful in my new job (I was thrown out from my last job - was constantly unstable; moody ,angry, racing and sad - impossible to work with). Lamictal is very expensive but it's worth every penny as living without it isn't a life for me. There is one thing that came with Lamictal, and that is that I'm sometimes very absent-minded and have to concentrate very hard so my thoughts doesn't fly away, when I for instance drive my car. To conclude: This treatment-combo actually saved my life. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my new medication. The future is bright. The future is now."

I believe it should be the first drug prescribed when a doctor suspects a patient might be Bipolar rather than Lithium because Lamictal has proven to be just as effective as a mood stabilizer but has fewer side effects than Lithium. It is also effective on depression as Lithium is, but not as effective on mania as Depakote. I take a combination of 400mg Lamictal, 500mg Depakote ER, 200mg Topamax, and 300mg Wellbutrin XL, which is very effective for me."

The only downside I feel more anxious as we increase the dosage. My doctor is still working on the dosage to correct the increased anxiety. The reason I love the medicine is the only side effect is skin rash if dosage is increased too fast(which I never experienced). I tried depokate and lithium with terrible side effects. I was able to discontinue my Zoloft. I'm still taking anxiety medication. Unfortunately I had to up the dose since taking Lamictal. The is what I mentioned earlier.

I have been challenged by depression all my life. Probably a combination of genetics and nurture. My parents were alcoholics and my brother died at 33 of a drug overdose. My parents died at seperate events when I was 17 and eighteen. I was physically and sexually abused by age seven and on my own at age thirteen. I have had difficulty with relationships all my life. I married for twelve years and had two beautiful children, unfortunately that came to an end some five years ago when my x-wife stepped out on me. Since then my depression has deepened into a state that is nearly unbearable. I also suffer from chronic pain from a fall seven years ago where I fractured my spine in numerous places and hip. I am able to walk and while having been on disability for a year couldn't stand not working and went back to my profession. Thanks to the kindness of others I have some hope for this medication and wished to pass on my story, that it may be of some benefit to others.

I also take Celexa and Wellbutrin. I'm thinking about stopping the Wellbutrin. It doesn't do much for me.

8/7/2006 5:11:49 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"Lamictal for Depression? Almost better than SSRI's Summary: Let me start by saying Lamictal really works. In my opinion it had a very distinct effect on my mood unlike SSRI's that tend to be less pronounced. It worked good-- I probably would have stayed with it but side-effects were an issue. For me the big side-effects were acne flare-ups (doctor denies this should be from Lamictal) and extremely rapid weight gain. It took me a while to realize the Lamictal was giving me a huge appetite, and I gained 10 pounds... and fast. Have since lost the weight after going back to Prozac. Original Review with updates: Very GOOD!! After six months, I can honestly say this is the most effective antidepressant I've ever tried. A welcome change from the typical SSRI. I started week one at 25mg daily (starter-pack). I felt nothing at all and was worried this medication would be a failure. Then increased to 25mg x 2 for about two weeks as per the starter pack. There was a very subtle improvement in my mood. I did have a few occurences of double-vision during the second week. I was also really tired. Upon switching to 100mg at week four my mood continued to improve and side effects disappeared completely. Doctor now has me set at 200mg and I'm feeling the best I have in a long time. Rarely have a blue day. Update at month six (November 2005) I asked the doctor if he would let me take 150mg Wellbutrin because I was having a big appetite and gaining weight. Positives: 1. Greatly improved and stable mood. 2. No emotional blunting. (e.g. Laugh & Cry). 3. Very few side effects. 4. No reduction in sex drive or performance. Negative: 1. Increased appetite. 2. Caused my old acne to flare up a bit."

I find myself with a normal spectrum of emotions for the first time in my life. I always thought that I was totally normal, despite bouts of major depression involving some self-mutilation and 2 suicide attempts, one of which landed me in a hospital for 2 days with seizures and dangerously rapid heart-beat. After getting into a steady relationship that was as stable as I was capable of keeping it, I realized that I was an emotional wreck. With a lot of encouragement and affection from my partner, I was able to go in for talk therapy and eventually for a psychiatric evaluation. I was completely taken by surprise when the psychiatrist told me that she thought I was bipolar - I thought I was just depressed. I resisted the diagnosis for a while, then tried Geodon. Geodon did not work for me - I became sluggish, anxious, and had really drastic mood shifts (even for me, which is saying a lot!) that almost ended in a 3rd suicide attempt. Once I reached the point of serious suicidal thoughts I immediately discontinued the Geodon after only about 2 weeks of treatment. I did some research and asked my psychiatrist if I could try lamictal - she agreed and things have been really good ever since. I am finally able to take positive steps with the advice given to me by my therapist - I'm finally under enough emotional control to be able to try things consistently, and to be able to see when things are shifting one way or another and need some kind of attention / preventative steps. I am so, so, so happy with the results I have had from Lamictal - I hope that it helps others as much as it has helped me!"

8/2/2006 4:56:05 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"If you're frustrated with weight gain, try this... I'd been taking Depakote for 9 years, and have attemped other meds which haven't worked out. While the Depakote had been effective in managing the bi-polar condition, I'd also gained close to 60 pounds in those 9 years. I'd tried everything to combat the weight gain but nothing worked short of starving myself, which can also push me into a manic spin. Since beginning the switch to Lamictal, I have lost a total of 15 pounds in the last three months. The stability that I experienced while taking Depakote has remained. The only other side effect i've noticed is a dry mouth but it never hurts to drink more water. The titration period can be a pain but once up to speed, ease of use is excellent. This has been the best experience I've had yet with medication treatment for bi-polar condition. For those who think that weight gain is a 'vanity' issue, I'd say that obesity also poses a danger to health and self-esteem. Hard to feel positive about yourself and the world when you are feeling like Jabba the Hutt. Check in: 8/02/06 I've now been taking lamictal for over a year. I've lost a total of 45 pounds. The symptoms of bi-polar disorder have continued to be manageable although i do notice more of a feeling of slight mania than when i was taking depakote. That might just be my natural state of being without the 'depakote head foggy brain' thing. A friend has commented to me that not every feeling I have can be attributed to mood disorder. Some of my feelings and behaviours are actually part of my psyche and/or due to actual situations. My life and sense of self-esteem are noticeably improved due to switching to Lamictal. Family, friends and acquaintences have all remarked on it. I feel as close to 'normal' as i can imagine feeling. It's a miracle, as far as I'm concerned."

I told the pdoc I needed something else and she mentioned Lamictal but said it would be a last resort and put me on Depakote which I'd hated from back before I got on the zoloft. I researched and at my next visit (after stopping depakote and slowing ramping down off lithium up to my next appointment) I told her that I wanted to try Lamictal. I'm in my 7th week now and finally am at 100mg after moving up 25, 50, and 75 for two weeks each. BTW, no rash here. There is a tremendous difference in my life. Though I'm currently rapid cycling big time (days now instead of weeks as before) the peaks and valleys are not nearly as high or low, and they go away faster. If this is as good as it gets, I'll take it, forever. I'm hoping that stabilizing on 100m or a little higher will stop the rapid cycling. But as noted, my illness is bearable now that I'm no longer an unpredictable stranger to my family.

I am med sensitive so my pdoc started me out at 12.5 mgs and I increased by that amount every 4 days until I got to 200 mgs. I've tried increasing it beyond 200 mgs. in the past, but get a lot of anxiety/agitation (probably due to the anti-depressant properties). 200 mgs has been my mainstay. I've been on just about all the meds in conjunction with Lamictal. The best has been Depakote at a low, low dose. It increases the Lamictal levels and I'll take all the anti-depressant effect I can. Give it a try and stick with it while you are titrating. I owe my life to this med."

They used to give me valium, frissium, librium, homeopathic medicine etc for my ""bad nerves"". More recently I was prescribed Prozac alone which made me manic. The combination of Prozac (20 mg) and Lamictal (200 mg) has made me feel what I think is close to normal??? - whatever that is. I also take Provigil/Modifinal (100mg) which keeps away the drowsiness caused by Prozac and is really the last piece of the cocktail jigsaw. Lamictal has made short term memory deteriorate and I have to re-read short passages of text more than once to get the meaning - but this is an acceptable side effect and I know that the alternative is to exerience those very painful depressive periods.

5/30/2006 12:32:07 PM,0.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Itching, itching, and more itching Having been resistant to other front-line meds, my psychiatrist suggested Lamictal. He gave me the starter pak, which starts you at 25mg once per day for 2 weeks before moving up to the next higher dose. Prior to taking this drug, I did a lot of research and was fully familiar with the rash potential. Against my better judgment, I decided to give it a shot. And, I even cut the 25 mg pills in half, so my initial starting dose was 12.5. On the first day, within a few hours of taking the 12.5 mg dose, I developed a mild itching all over. Checked with my doc, and he said to monitor myself, but not serious enough to discontinue. So I continue with the 12.5 dosing regimen. Little by little, the itching increased, to the point it was keeping me up at night. On the 8th day of treatment, I woke up with red, puffy eyes, intense itching (so bad I wanted to tear my skin off), coughing, and red blotches all over my chest and arms. I contacted my doc who recommended discontinuing the medication as I clearly could not tolerate it. If I continued treatment, I ran the risk of developing a very serious rash. So took the remaining pills and flushed them down the toilet. Good thing I didn't pay for this starter pak (sample from doc) or else I would have been really mad at wasting my money. I know that when this medication works, it really helps people. However, for those who get the rash, it is an awful medication. When it is bad, it is really bad. It is a shame that a medication that has the potential to really help people has such serious drawbacks. I wonder if the manufacturer downplays the number of rashes caused by this medication? Anyway, tread cautiously with this medication. I will never use it again. Try to use other meds if you can and use this only as a last resort. It is no joke!"

I decided to stop the Zyprexa and try monotherapy with Lamictal, and, roughly two weeks later, packed all of my husband's things in trash bags, and attempted to throw him out of the house. I was crying constantly, and paranoid of everything. I didn't realize I was in the throes of a ""mixed state"" until my therapist told me I was in trouble. I stopped the Lamictal soon after that. The other problem that I had with this medication was that I spotted while on my birth control pills. If you're taking birth control, be careful with this med-it could make them not work. (My doctor told me then that Lamictal was safe with birth control, but I was paranoid anyway, and now they're saying that it could cause them to be less effective.)"

I tried Lamictal, and have been on it for 2 months. In less than a week, I felt my depression lifting significantly. After a few weeks, I find myself feeling better than I have in many years. I am experiencing happiness and relearning joy in living, after fearing I would never feel these things again. My social withdrawal has vanished.

It has been nothing short of a life-saver. Since the initial stablization, I have increased to 300mg a day. Over time, I needed a little more to maintain efficacy. Apparently that is very typical. The real beauty of Lamictal, though, is that it doesn't require you to take all sorts of anti-depressants with it. Just one med does the trick. In my case, I continue to take the 200mg/day of Topamax that I was taking before beginning Lamictal. Didn't want to mess with a combination that seemed to be working. I'm also taking various herbal and vitamin supplements: a multivitamin, omega 3 fatty acids, B complex and maca (female hormone balancing supplement). I take everything at night now. I was finding that the Lamictal, at the higher dosage, was really making me sleepy when I took it in the morning. I also find that I tend to just nod off easily throughout the day, like when I'm working at the computer, etc... so I have to really be alert to that when I'm driving. Not been a problem thus far, but for long trips, I would be extra careful. I still have some real difficulties with major depression right before my period, so my pdoc just prescribed Prozac, to be taken just for the week before my period starts, if I feel really depressed and suicidal. But last month I was okay. So I'll have to see... I'll probably put that into a separate rating. Overall, my life has been transformed.

This drug is a miracle, and I would know, because I have tried so many. It is unlike anything else. There are some headaches in the beginning, but STICK WITH IT! They go away. My doctor described bipolar like little seizures going on in the brain, and if you can catch them soon enough and stop them, they won't get worse over time or damage your brain. If you treat them early, you are better off. Don't waste any more time!!!! (note: i am not a doctor) I would recommend this even for people with treatment-resistant depression. I think some people's brains are wired in a bipolar manner and just haven't experienced the other side enough to know it's there. Just know that this stuff rocks.

A couple days later I was very itchy on my head (under my hair) and back. The next day is when the burning began. My skin burned, as if it were really on fire, from the inside of my body. The only thing I can relate it to is a really bad sunburn, when you can feel the heat of it after, but this was much more intense and much worse. There was no redness like a sunburn has, either. This burning took place on my head, face, nose, ears, back of neck, front of neck, upper arms, lower arms, back, and upper legs (very occassionally). The location would change throughout the day and be either one place or multiple places from the list I just gave. It was absolutely awful! I did not take the med again after that, as it may have been a precursor to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The first many hours after my first missed dose the burning turned 180-degrees to the complete opposite: extreme freezing! I hate the cold, so that was even worse than burning. :-P I also had blurred vision. In the morning, the burning was back - I'd rather have that than the cold, so it was relief to some amount - and the blurred vision was gone. It took a week for the burning to go away."

The recommended minimum dose is 200 mg, so I went up to 200 mg and am waiting to see what happens next. My verdict on Lamotrigine: so far, so good, but maybe Carbamazepine was better at keeping generalized seizures at bay. Time will tell... Mind you, it seems to be a fairly mild drug whose main selling point is the lack of side-effects and a slight anti-depressive effect as a bonus. The manufacturer can't boast any improved anti-seizure effect compared to established drugs.

4/24/2006 8:30:05 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"Great, but I had rare, dangerous side effect Lamictal worked great. We added it after trying so many other things in combination with my Wellbutrin XL. Unfortunately, Lamictal has a ""black box"" warning about a skin rash because it can lead to a serious, often fatal condition. Getting the disease is extremely rare, and usually on very high doses, but if you get any kind of rash from it, you are supposed to stop it. Well, I am the rare side-effect queen, and I began developing a rash on my eyelids. No more Lamictal for me. I was really disappointed I could no longer take it. It is definitely worth a try, especially if your depression is resistant to medication, as mine is."

Because Doc says it's only effective at higher doses. I eventually got up to 250 mg. I developed severe dsylexia in speach and typing. I would intend to open the fridge door and consistantly opened cabinets instead. Developed severe hand tremmors and head bobbing. I stopped taking it. Several months later, I thought why not try just 25 mg. It's fine so far. Racing thoughts gone depression lifted. Perhaps I'm a low dosage responder? Hope so!"

I had to stop taking it because I noticed I was breaking out in a rash on my back and face. I slowly tapered off the drug and a few days after I finally stopped taking Lamictal, I went into such severe mania and panic attacks that I thought I was going to rip my hair out. The weird part was though, I went on the medication for extreme depression and I had never had mania before. I am now on Topamax, but the anxiety and lack of energy is really discouraging."

Within an hour of the first dose, I felt lots of itching all over my body (although no rash, thankfully). The itching kept on quite frequently throughout the day. It was pretty annoying. On the second day, within about an hour of taking the 12.5 mg dose, the itching resumed, but this time was accompanied by feelings of agitation. By nighttime, I felt rather nauseated and headachy. I got very little sleep. By early morning I was vomiting and had a big headache. I ended up vomiting several times. Spent the day in bed, weak as could be and suffering from a monster headache. The next day, I did not take lamictal. The itching and agitation went away, and the nausea and headache were subsiding. My doc and I have agreed that this drug is not for me!"

4/17/2006 1:49:55 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Positive Experience I had suspected that I was bipolar. A psychologist examined me via a battery of test for some five hours. Her conclusion was that I am not bipolar, but perhaps have depression. My psychiatrist, on the other hand, claims that I am bipolar. What to believe? Well, I've come to the conclusion that it's more imporatant for me to find a med that works that put a label to it all. In January, I had my family doctor put me (temporarily) on Lamictal until I could be evaluated. The psychiatrist has kept me on the drug. It has been highly effective. I am also on Omega 3 fish oil. Have been since January as well. (Spring Valley, 1700 mg per capsule, 480 EPA, 400 DPA. I take 3 capsules per day, with meals). The combination has helped me greatly. I'm currently on a low dose of Lacmictal (100 mg), and it seems to do the trick. I broke out with a rash after only a few weeks on the med. I went in to see my family doctor the next day. It turned out to be a staff infection. I never thought I'd be so happy to have a staff infection! I wanted so badly to stay on this med! I've always had trouble sleeping. That is no longer a factor. I take my tablet, and my head hits the pillow and I'm asleep in a matter of minutes. That's never happened before. I've always been a light sleeper until taking Lamictal. I have had no periods of hypomania or depression once I reached 100 mg. My moods are quite stable. This is a very different feeling. I'd been taking a number of antidepressants over the years (Zoloft, Effexor, St. John's Wort, SAM-e), but experienced hypomania as a result (misdiagnosed as depression when I believe I'm bipolar). My other issues have been obsessiveness, anxiety and rejection sensitivity. All of these have improved greatly, especially the obsessiveness and anxiety. This has been the most effective med that I have ever taken for my issues. It's been a God send."

I have had no noticable side effects. Im taking lamictal because of the side effects lithium is causing me (getting fat) and all the other side effects. Ill have to wait until february 2006,so the lamictal gets a good working start. My doctor also started me on abilify 10mg at night to help with protecting me against manic-psycosis episode, to avoid a hospitalization if a manic episode trys to occur. Lithium works well on the mind, I hope lamictal and abilify does the job for me, my history in the 24 years I have had bi-polar has been that I have had manic episodes once in every 4 to 6 years and it takes 6 months to a year to heal and recover. Well thank God for new medicines. I also need freinds like all of you for support, because this could be an isolating disease. I saw my Dr, today Jan16th,the babilify did not work, it made me feel like I wanted to jump out of my skin, i am off the abilify. My Dr.is letting me go off the lithium and he is going up on the lamictal I will be taking 200mg of lamictal and in two months my Dr. wants to talk about taking tegratol possibly to start taking it to go along with the lamictal, because I do not do good taking antiphycotics and the lithium works but theres been to much weight gain and lots of bloating and I dont want to live like that, the whole goal is to be on the right medications to keep me from having a manic episode and to keep me out of a hospitalization.Up date: Im off the lithium and up to 200mg of lamictal a day.I will se my Dr.in two months.The abilify is not for me. Im off of it now.On my next visit the Dr. wants to talk about putting me on another anticonvulsant along with the lamictal, he says the lamictal alone is not enough,so far Im doing great.I saw my dr 3/14/06 and i will stay on the 200 mg lamictal once a day.

4/15/2006 3:02:31 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Are the side effects worth it? I have been on several anti-convulsive drugs since I was diagnosed in 1997. I've been on this one for a couple of years, but according to the doctor the dosage is high at 300 mg in the morning and 450 mg in the evening, but it controls the seizures. All of the meds I have tried cause pretty much the same side effects: short-term memory loss, vision impairment and loss of balance. Almost, an intoxicated like feeling. I have found that taking this medication on a full stomach does ease the effects of vision and balance. It is best to take with a meal when possible because a snack just doesn't seem to reduce the side effects. Because if they're really bad, I can't see to drive, I'm off balance, or I just can't keep my eyes open. Sometimes I feel like I'm not talking straight. It does make me feel ill at times. Since I still struggled with the side effects for so long, I came to terms with the possiblity of surgery which had been recommended several times. After much research, consideration and prayer, I have been evaluated for surgery. However, my neurologist informed me at my last visit that there is currently not enough information to make me a candidate for surgery. However, he is adding Zonegran to my daily meds so he can bring the Lamictal down from 750 mg to 450 mg total for the day. So far, so good. I'm not all the way down but I'm sure it'll work because when I was in for my video eeg I felt great on the lower doses. Only problem with lower doses is seizures occur, so the Zonegran is to help prevent those from occuring. So, for the time being, I'm in a holding pattern with the new plan of action. Hopefully, the lower dose will alleviate the side effects and give me a better quality of life. I do believe the side effects are probably different for each person. So, each person will have to decide what works best for them. I hope you find one that works for you. Update 4-15-06: I have reache"

The last couple of days I've actually been a bit depressed, but this doesn't happen very often anymore. And, I know that it's not going to last long, whereas a year ago a little depression like this would turn into 2 or 3 or 4 weeks of hell! I'll be right in a couple of days. It's great to know that that is going to happen. My grandpa died on the 4th Feb. I watched him die for 3 days in hospital as his heart was failing, hardly having any sleep, sitting by his bedside watching him breathe, wondering if each breath was going to be his last. After he died I had to help organise the cremation, and a thanksgiving service with myself making a speech, and it was quite stressful. I was obviously very down during this period, and it took a number of weeks to pick up. But, it was grief, and I felt it like anyone else would feel it, and I've been dealing with it just like everyone else in my family. The wheels didn't fall of the cart. I think it was a very good test for how this drug is working, and the result is excellent. I've got more faith in it now, as I've had so many meds not work for me, I've been very skeptical with anything new. Still, the only gripe is that this is *so* expensive here in Australia. It's rediculous. I just hope that I don't have to increase the dose. Anti-convulsants doses go up and down - that's the nature of them, or so I've read. Waiting for the day our govt gets it act together with this drug. [21/12/05] I've not long gone up to 200mg, and that's where i'm going to stay. I really don't have a bad word to say about this drug.

I also was taking 20 mg of Prozac until last week. I fear my Lamictal dosage is too high.

BUT I didn't fall as long down as before, and the downs were much shorter. Until recently, after 2 years use, where I started rapid cycling... Probably set of by stress.. I am still using the medication and I will continue, it certainly has stabilized my moods somewhat for a time. And I have not had any side effects. I take the tablets once a day, and except the horrible taste of the tablets if I don't swallow them quick enough, it is convenient.

4/6/2006 8:12:35 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"One of the best psych meds out there!!! This is a great medication. It has helped even out out my mood, dampened my GAD and lifted my spirits to the point that the everyday tasks I used to loathe have become almost automatic. I would highly recommend it. I have a long relationship with psychiatric medications and this one comes out as one of those that can do the job. I would say that it is going to become a useful tool in unipolar depression and ADD. My sense of clarity and task efectiveness has greatly improved along with my memory. The return of my memory has been a welcome surprise after all the years of benzo and SSRI memory blunting. My current Bipolar I cocktail is Cymbalta 60mg once daily (would like to increase it 60mg twice daily for more NE) Lamictal 100mg twice daily and Klonopin/Rivotril 2mg at night. Over the years Lamictal has become a core drug in my regimen. Once you get to an effective dose you'll be amazed at the consistency of mood and mentality that can be experienced. It's great to feel stable again. I rate Lamictal as one of the best drugs on the market. It brought me stability for the first time in my life and helped me to understand and deal with being bipolar. Left untreated, bipolar disorder has caused great pain to myself and those that had to endure me. I have been to the heights and depths of life more times than I would like to remember. This has not been proactive except that the experiences of the past have allowed me to learn what was needed to be done to change myself. So, in a sense it has served me for the better. It does seem to have been an awful waste of time though. It has also destroyed too many relationships with partners and friends over the years. This I am not proud of. This is where Lamictal has been a godsend. From someone that has lived like a king and a pauper I would recommend this drug if you're looking for stability in your life.

I remember movitation and drive and hopefulness and enthusiasm - but they seemed to bleed from my life at about 30. The past 11 years have been a downward spiral with only brief periods of partial relief, but I never experienced improvement like this. I've been on Lamictal 2 months, working up 25 mg/wk the first month to hold at 100 mg (no side effects). I'm also on Welbutrin 300 mg. With a diagnosis of major depression, I've been given Prozac, Selexa, Lexapro, Effexor, Xanax(for anxiety), finally landing on Wellbutrin (which I still take) a year ago. Everything seemed to help somewhat for awhile and then the depression and anxiety would creep back with an inability to experience pleasure - chronic insomnia - irrational fear that seemed to paralyze my actions - inability to control emotions - a lack of energy. I knew there had to be something out there that would make this better. My pdoc thought I could have bipolar disorder and suggested a mood stabilizer. I resisted (fear of the side effects) but was desperate and agreed. Within a week of reaching 100 mg, I seemed to change overnight. I feel energy, hopefulness, motivation, emotional balance. I haven't had a Xanax in 6 weeks. I've accomplished more at work in the past 3 weeks than in the previous 3 months. I feel like someone's lifted a heavy blanket off my soul. I can't believe I was stuck like this for half my adult life! At least I finally have what I believe to be a correct diagnosis and have experienced the relief that had eluded me for over a decade!"

It worked for me on a subtle level, a low level cage of tension and nervousness. It allowed me to understand my emotions, so see the patterns, and to adjust to change them. It allowed me control and perspective. However, Lamictal is known for its side effects. I wanted to put my experience out there for those who may be deciding whether or not to continue with the drug up to a therapudic dosage. My advice would be, give this drug a chance, but if your side effects are crippling, it is probably not meant to be. Even though I overcame my side effects and the drug worked for me, they returned. I tried Lamictal twice, the first time stopped after 2 weeks since the rash was incredibly itchy, to the point of tears, all night long (Allegra may have helped, but it works the best as preventative. Once the side effect starts I don't know how to stop it). The second time however, I was determined to see it through. I went up a half a pill (12.5 mg) every week, combined with Allegra/Fexofenadine. The first day I had a rash (no blisters or broken skin, no itching, only redness all over my body), sollen face and lips, sensitive skin, and headaches. This went away in a couple of days, like any other swelling. A week later when I went up again I got 3 itchy hives on my face and neck, again these went away in a couple of days. The next week I had extreme sleepiness; I had to take a nap 30min after I took my dose. I now take my entire dose at night. The week after that was probably the worst with canker sores all over my mouth, about 7. I could hardly eat, talk, or brush my teeth. I waited until those went away, about 2 weeks before increasing my dose again. For this entire period my skin remained sensitive. After 4-6 weeks the side effects completely went away.

It turns out I have bipolar II and have been on lamictal for 30 days. So far, it has pulled me out of a suicidal depression and reduced my crippling migraines to an occasional headache. I have more energy, am calmer, happier and am better able to concentrate. My menstrual cycle which was always all over the place seems to have regulated itself. I am also strangely tidier and more organized than I have ever been in my life. My husband is wondering why the house is suddenly clean but is very happy with the changes. It has also pushed my libido up to a new level which is really nice. So far, no rash and I am very happy to be on this med. My Pdoc will add Wellbutrin to the mix to boost my mood a little bit further up and now that I am on Lamictal I am hoping this won't make me switch.

3/9/2006 10:24:29 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"It made a big difference for me! I take this drug for treatment of partial seizures. I was taking it exclusively for about 5 months, then my doctor added Keppra (which I reviewed elsewhere on this site already). The Lamictal made a huge difference for me. I've had simple partial seizures for years, but they eventually progressed into complex partial seizures, which prompted me to seek treatment for a second time (more on that in a minute). When I was put on Lamictal, the first thing I noticed as a side effect was that I was EXTREMELY tired the day after taking the first dose. That was only with the first dose, though. The only other thing I noticed was that while stepping up the dose once, I had a few small panic attacks for about a day and a half. But that was an isolated incident, and I had only been on this drug for a couple months at that point. Since then there have been absolutely no side effects. This drug totally eliminated my complex partial seizures...bye-bye, blackouts! Unfortunately, it hasn't been entirely effective at eliminating my simple partial seizures. I'm still fighting an uphill battle with those, but I'd consider no more blacking out to be signifigant progress. This is one of those drugs where you need to start out on a very small dose and work your way up to a therapeutic dose. I was initially put on a starter kit and worked up to a regular dose over the course of about 3 weeks or so, and have increased a bit more a few times since then. I've suffered with partial seizures since I was 16, but I wasn't diagnosed until 1997, when I was 23. I tried Tegretol and Neurontin at that time, which did little for me. My seizures were minor back then, so I decided to stop taking the drugs, stop going to the doctor and just live with it. BIG mistake! I should've stuck with the treatment. Instead, I foolishly let it go and it progressively got worse to the point that I had no choice but to seek treatment again. Let this be a lesson to you...if you're di"

I am writing to assure you to be patient and that like most medications for Bipolar Disorder they do take time to be the most effective. I have been on Lamictal for over 4 years now and only because of this drug do I feel like my old self and have my life back. I am ultra-rapid cycling bipolar. I am currently taking 300 mg twice a day which is the highest dose recommended but the severity and frequency of my symptoms is probably a factor. At the height of my mania, I was screaming at my husband over anything and everything. I spit in his face on Thanksgiving over something so trivial I dont remember what it was. I was so low that I was curled up on the floor crying since the vacuum cleaner wasnt working properly. These episodes were within days of each other. I tried lithium and it helped tremendously but after several months I could tell that it wasnt stablizing me properly and my shrink added lamictal. It didnt seem to help much right away but after a cpl of months the change was amazing!!! I finally felt like myself again. Granted I had (and still do)monitor my sleep schedule which is very important. I am not being melodramatic when I say this but if I wasnt for Lamitcal, I would most likely be dead.

I was out of work for three months due to these dibilitating disorders. It took a few weeks to see positive results. The starter pack took 5 weeks to build up to the 100mg per day theraputic dose. The worst side effect for me was that it caused insomnia, but that eventually subsided. I was given Lunesta to help with the insomnia, but I only ended up taking it twice and then I was back to a normal sleep cycle. Another side effect I encountered was dizziness. When I turned my head it felt like I was drunk. I refrained from driving until that subsided after about two weeks. The constant dizziness also caused some nausea. Dosage was increased to 150mg after two months of use. Was working wonderfully until additional stresses were encountered in my life (both parents with chronic health problems and workload increased) all at the same time. Dose was increased to 200mg. This helped with the heart palpitations, but was not effective in my mood swings. I felt like I was out of control. 5mg of Lexapro has just been added this week and I'm already feeling much calmer and relaxed. Still having OCD tendencies, but my mood is more stable.

It eases once I am on a new dosage for a few weeks, but has affected being able to work. I am currently in process for Social Security Disability because my anxiety is still horrible, and I hang in the hypomanic.

I have a history of almost eighteen years with my disorder, and it was not treated til I was in my thirties.

It has truly helped my depression/bipolar II diagnosed self to pull up out of the depths and think more clearly. I also take lithium, Zoloft, and Provigil. The Provigil is a fairly recent addition. when the Lamictal was started, it seemed to make me more depressed as I was taken off another drug. The Lamictal is started at a very low dose (25 mg) and slowly built up by doubling the dosage every 2 weeks. When I had built up to 100 mg qd, I was still somewhat depressed. My psychiatrist was concerned that my Estring insert was interfering with the Lamictal, and he ordered a blood test for lamotrigine level. He then increased my dosage to 200 mg q.d. Since then, the depression is much better. I did have a mix-up with my medications and was not sure if I'd taken the medication for 2 days or 4 days. I had to start the build-up all over again. The deadly skin rash is still a possibility when re-starting, even though it did not happen the first time.

I told my doc I wanted off the Lamictal due to nightmares/disturbed sleep and increased anxiety. She told me to taper down over 2 weeks, and I started Prozac...and was going to start another stabilizer at my next visit. I have been on 50mgs Lamictal for the past week. I've been quite depressed. Not sure if it's normal cycle, etc. The Prozac has been helping with my obsessive anxiety, but not too much with the depression. Yesterday I got into a deep-hole depression with some major irritability/agitation. Out of desperation, I took 100mgs of Lamictal instead of 50mg. About 45 minutes later, I felt myself being lifted out of the abyss I was in. The depression eased and the irritability waned. So I am convinced now to stay on the Lamictal. I think it was helping me more than I realized. And ever since I started the Prozac, my nightmares have been completely eliminated and quality of sleep has been improved. I still need to take a smidgin of Seroquel (only a 1/4 of a pill - 6.25mgs) for some of the insomnia Lamictal causes. So the Prozac has literally enabled me to continue the Lamictal, which was helping more than I thought.

Lamictal takes care of my ever present depression just fine. I cannot take any anti-depressants under no circumstances unless I want to become hospitalized with psychotic mania. Lamictal also controls my severe manic episodes. I did experience 2 mild mixed episodes while I was titrating but then I quickly stabilized with the help of Abilify for a few days. Since I have been on theraputic dose, no depression, no mania. Along with Seroquel that helps my OCD and rage I am finally stable for the first time in my life. Praise God for Lamictal. For the first time in my life I know what it's like to be pleasant and in good moods and happy to be around people and no depression and to be this way ALL THE TIME. My emotions are not dead and blunted but I can feel all my emotions appropriately. Again praise God for Lamictal."

When he was first diagnosed BP, we had no insurance, so now, no insurance companies will cover him. I called several pharmacies in the U.S. and was shocked to find the cost was so high (upwards around $500 and more). I went to Canadapharmacy.com and found the same drug (both brand name and generic) for about $60 for 84 tablets. I paid a one time shipping fee of $50 so now my shipping is free for the remainder of my life! It takes approximately 7 days to get the medicine in the mail. You do have to have a valid prescription, which you must fax or email to them before they will fill your prescription. It's a great service and has saved me tons of money -- not to mention my sanity! I don't know what I would have done if my son had to go w/out the meds... I wouldn't have been able to get them for him otherwise... One other thing about them... you can request that your meds be sent to you in their original packaging -- if you are like me and concerned about the legitamcy of the program. I did a lot of research and found Canadapharmacy.com to be the best, most reliable out there."

I also can't sleep without a sleeping pill (zopiclone) which my doctor doesn't want to give me any more after these run out. I was wondering whether anyone else has had these effects. I will stick with it for a while to see whether it stops otherwise I will have to stop taking it which is a shame because apart from the pain and discomfort and the sleeping problems I am feeling much better in myself and more motivated. UPDATE 11/11/05;I increased to 100mg about 3 weeks ago and have felt great since.Had a minor high while on holiday and split up with my long term girlfriend, which is a shame as she has put up with me for so long when I was down. No more pains in shoulders or neck and sleeping ok but waking early. I have had ear ache and a swollen neck for about 2 weeks and now on my second lot of antibiotics don't know whether it has any conection with lamactal, time will tell. All in all I am happy with the result of taking lamactal as I was in a v poor state on lithium for a year.will keep you all updated. UPDATE: 2/2/06.

If anything, I MORE moody than I was before, and it doesn't do much to curb the anxiety. I think I'm agoraphobic because I don't feel comfortable leaving the house alone. I also have trouble concentrating, which is difficult because I'm trying to finish college. One of the worst side effects is that it dries me out.

At first it was like a miracle -- I didn't believe it was possible to feel so good. In one week, depression gone, able the think clearly, slept through the night (amazing). I was literally skipping down the street. I was on top of the world! Unfortunately, the effects waned and the dose was increased. My doctor swears it couldn't happen because of this drug, but I gained 15 lbs in four months. Gradually my depression came back, big time--along with my insomnia. I was finally forced to quit it cold turkey 5 days ago, due to serious side effects -- I won't go into detail here, as it may have been complicated by another drug that I was taking. I do believe that the Lamictal ultimately left me feeling weak and with shortness of breath. Curiously, now that I am off of it, my depression is gone (of course that won't last for long!) but now I'm suffering tremendous anxiety. So, need to get back to my REAL body....then start over again. So disappointing!!"

I had headaches constantly until the day I got to 200 mgs when they suddenly disappeared. My shrink said that was somewhat common. Mega doses of Tylenol seemed to be the only drug that worked well on the headaches. My doctor didn’t stop at 200 mg, but kept pushing up my dosage until it made me dizzy and then backed back down. Now I take 400 mg a day, once a day. He was very clear about taking it just once a day, although I’ve never asked him why. Lamictal has erased years of swinging between depression and anxiousness. I have a hard time remembering what those times were like any longer. It is almost like Bipolar type 4 cracked my foundation and Lamictal has repaired it.

I experienced twenty years of severely treatment resistant bipolar I (rapid cycling with two episodes of major depression each year of 2-4 months duration. Occasional but severe mixed manias.)I had pretty much given up hope that medication could ever be helpful for the depression at all. And the depression prevented me from being functional for six months of every year. Lithium easily controlled the mania but actually made the depression worse. Wellbutrin was the first antidepressant to help and Tegretol was helpful for Mania. However, when I added Lamictal to the wellbutrin I began to have my first sustained periods without depression in 20 years! Most importantly, the cycling has diminished so much now that the depression--when it appears-- ususally only last a few days every couple of months."

And had no side-effects, no flat moods, no limitations to my feelings, intelligence or anything else. I can be still sad and cry, or be happy and enjoy things according to what happens in a natural way. But I never went down like it was before. The only thing that surprises me is that I read here that Lamictal is a mood stabilizer. My own experience is that it prevents me from getting depressed, but I did have one episode of hypomania. I slept only very little without needing more sleep, was very nervous and my thoughts where running. I had obsessive thoughts (was in love with someone who was playing with me) and though I could clearly see and analize the whole situation I just couldn't stop myself..also heard a lot of hard, loud music. Well, doing just the oppsite from what I wanted to do in my state, helped so much. I started to listen to soft, classical music, urged myself to bed at a decent hour (after doing some relaxing-techniques) and so on So Lamictal has helped with depression, but cannot prevent hypomania in my case. By the way, I found out that I go hypomanic when I'm heavily in love and cannot get in relation to the loved person. Would like to know if anybody exprienced the same thing."

I don't experience any side effects on this medication but i don't know if it's working. I was on Zoloft (200mg per day) before and because I have symptoms of binge eating disorder, I noticed results with the Zoloft. It really helped me control the episodes of bingeing.

I have also been hospitalized related to the symptoms that come along with depression, which i'm sure you are well aware of if you are visiting this website. I chose to discontinue the meds when I became pregnant. I had a rough time without the meds, but I had a healthy baby and that all that mattered. Six months after my daughter was born the symptoms came back and it became very difficult to function. I then went to a psychiatrist (a new one because my family had relocated). After a couple of sessions he diagnosed me with BP. He then prescribed Lamictal. I have now been taking Lamictal for 5 years. I still cycle but not at the extreme as before. At one time I lived in fear of ""going there again"". It has been over six years since I have been hospitilized. I take 200 mg of Lamictal every day.

I am on my fifth week, doing the standard 25mg for 2 weeks, 50mg for 2 weeks and then 100mg the fifth week. I noticed such immediate benefit from 25mg that I couldn't imagine going up with it. I became more social, more spirited, more relaxed about things, more positive all around. I also am taking the minimum amount (because SSRIs make me sleepy) of Zoloft (25mg/day) and Neurontin (400mg/day) for anxiety. These were minimally effective but when the Lamictal started things changed dramatically, so I know it was the Lamictal. My doctor says he might dial down the other meds and eliminate them if the effectiveness of the Lamical continues. Side effects are minimal: dries my upper respiratory system out a bit, headachy the first week of taking it and slight insomnia (which was good because I also experience hypersomnia). Considering the benefits, I think the side effects are well worth enduring."

I have had great success at doing everything possible to avoid the damaging effects of Lithium. This along with other convulsants is the new age of mood stabilizng treatments which can prove to yield lower risk of toxicity in the hepatic and kidney function. This is one other reason why I am in great favor of this drug.(Hepatic-Acting on or occurring in the liver.) I have encountered a rather uncomfortable feeling of hot flashes and nausea. These usually pass although quite distressing they don't occur frequently enough to cause any significant hinderance. I reccomend consuming lots of fluids while on this medication and avoid over exertion for this can raise the body temperature to a very malignant level. Overall this medication has proved quite useful in my treatment plan. Medications work differently for each individual. Your results may not be as promicing as mine. Remember to always take your medication. Failure to do so can cause a manic or depressive episode. I have had experiences which were quite undesirable from even just skipping doses here and there.

The first evening I took 25mg I seemed to be aliviated of depression symtoms. This lasted one evening and into the morning. Now and then it still produces short lived relief. I am hopefull that the 100mg may produce sustained relief. I have had some weird memory lapse sensations, loss of balance and been very tired with exessive sleeping. My job is intellectually demanding so if the memory problems continue I will have to try something else. I have been just as depressed overall if not more than before beginning and still ponder the possibility of suicide though I have not gotten so far as to make a concrete plan. My biggest complain is lack of mental and physical energy which has been increased by the medication though was present before to a lesser extent. I cannot get myself to exercise either though this was a problem before starting as well. I am wary of the affects this medication has on L-carnitine (amino acid required for fat metabolism) reduction and folic acid processing affects.

I wish I only needed to take it once a day, like I did with phenobarbital. I have only taken it for a year and a half, and I think it might be slightly less effective than a couple months after starting it, but it could also be due to stress and being late taking it sometimes.

No sexual side effects, or if any, a slight increase in normal libido. The first two months I felt much more calm, almost a little distant.. but not in an unpleasant way whatsoever. A rash appeared on my wrist and collar bone after 1 month when I increased the dosage slowly as directed, but this caused no discomfort other than a mild itching and temporary scaring when I scratched. It lasted about 2 weeks or a little longer. I take it along with lithium and am doing so much better than with any other medication combination. I now understand why my Doctor at the hospital was so enthusiastic about Lamictal. I only wish my regular Psychiatrists had tried it earlier. I give it a rating of 9. Very high, though I still ""tilt"" a bit fairly often. I don't get those wonderful feelings I occassionally had as a child and teen before developing full-blown bipolar symptoms.. but I certainly feel better and more stable in general with only occassional episodes that are relatively mild and short-lived. With excersize and fresh air I suspect I'd feel 90% normal... whatever normal is."

I have taken Lamictal for over two years and I can honestly say that my life would be completely different without it. In fact I doubt that I would be alive, and if I were alive I am sure I would be miserable. I have been on several different drugs for bipolar/depression. Seroquel, wellbutrin, zoloft, celexa, lexapro (after the craziness of SSRIs they diagnosed me with bipolar II), and klonopin. I have also been in a mental institution after severe depression. I have to say after taking many different drugs I was convinced nothing would ever work and I would never be happy. SSRIs made me absolutely INSANE. Seroquel made me jittery and also made me feel like a zombie. One psychiatrist prescribed me lithium, but I never took it (was too scared of the side effects). I was prescribed those once I was already on Lamictal, though. I have to say Lamictal is the only drug that has worked for me at all. I don't feel perfectly normal, but I can FUNCTION. I can get out of bed in the morning and to me that is impressive. I also take concerta for ADHD and I take sleeping pills. The only side effects I've experienced with Lamictal are 1. it makes it hard for me to fall asleep. I have to take it right when I wake up or I have a lot of trouble sleeping even with sleeping pills. 2. It gives me dry mouth so I am always worried about bad breath. Okay, small prices to pay. (Note: I will also add that I take 275 mg a day, but that isn't an option listed for dosage.) I still get depressed sometimes, but NOTHING like how I used to be. I've only felt really manic once since I've been on it. That's when someone prescribed me seroquel, which I really didn't like. I've accepted that I'm never going to be completely happy so to me the way I feel on Lamictal is good enough. This drug is expensive but I HIGHLY recommend it. It's worth the money.

I wish I knew from point one, that the reason I was having flashbacks, strong memory senses, how the smell of certain fragrances would throw me back to a certain year during a certain scene etc. Then no matter the dose I was at, grand mal seizures. All of this happened due to the drug Lamictal. I suffered through heart palpitations, anxiety, what felt like heart attacks. They would come on strong the moment I popped the pills. I couldn't walk a small distance without losing breath and my heart pounding. I am a young 28 year old mother. Whenever we took me off of it to have my seizures studied at the Mayo Clinic epilepsy monitoring unit, I would ironically begin to feel great, heart wise. My flashbacks would subside etc. The moment I started the drugs back up, I would get the worst seizure feelings again. Needless to say over the course of the two years, I was beginning to really feel where it was coming from. From the suffering it caused, grand mal seizures and complex partial seizures from stress and anxiety and complete lack of sleep, I became very introverted and unhappy.I will say this, before the drug was increased and caused this much stress, I was still more open and happy. Just when the stress and seizures and crazy feelings wouldn't subside, that is when I became so introverted. So I don't feel the drug is to blame for that fully, more my situation. We finally looked into a second brain surgery. I had that done April of 2005. Which took out a significant amount I will need to have out for any pill to ever work for me. I was always on Phenobarbital, and my body continues to require that. About a month and a half after surgery, I seized. I decided no more Lamictal. The moment I stopped that pill, all the weird sensations left. No, anxiety, no heart problems, no weird smells, no flashbacks or strong memories.

At 25-50 mgs, Lamictal lifted my depression without spinning me into a manic high: I could come home from work, cook dinner, go for a walk, etc. I wasn't just crashing into the bed immediately as I had been doing. I did have the memory loss problem for about ten days, but that went away. Overall, I felt alive for the first time in a long time. Food had taste again, music sounded good. But then...(ominous music)... at 100 mgs, I became completely insensitive. I was really rude to everyone in this very quiet emotionless way. Then, I started getting aggressive: picking arguments, obsessing over little things. I really insulted several people at work, and had to take a day off for fear of saying or doing something really irreparable. I had to decrease my dose to 75 mgs. We'll see.... [Time passes] SO--It's a year later and I must say my mood swings have leveled out over the past year. I take 75 mgs of Lamictal with 25 mgs of Lexapro every day.

The more recent major depressive episode was much worse and prolonged, lasting nearly a year. I was undermedicated and my former psychiatrist had not picked up on how bad I was getting. Second hospitalization lead to current Lamictal/Celexa/Klonopin combo. Lamictal has definitely helped me to continue to be mood-stable and dosage increase to 250mg twice a day (from 200mg 2X/day) has made a really noticeable difference. Combined with low dose of Celexa (20-40mg) i have been mostly well, and for the first time in my life, really hopeful and healthily positive about my life. I didn't know what hopeful might mean since I can't remember ever feeling this way. Now I have a more realistic and hopeful attitude during a downturn, and am better able to take care of myself in other ways than just meds. I can't stress too much how continuing to learn about my disorder, and tackle behavioral and psychological traits and habits that work against me, has been as essential and necessary as meds. Very recently after considering the potential pluses and minuses of taking an antipsychotic, with my psych(s) (I'm seen both by resident and attending at each session at UCLA, which is teaching hospital) I chose Seroquel for hypomania since Klonopin alone didn't seem to help enough with hympomanic symptoms.

I spent almost ten years on antidepressants with little to no relief, and was recently diagnosed as bipolar, and told I had been misdiagnosed with depression. I have to say now that I am on this, and not antidepressants, I see my mood swings are extreme. I do not currently notice any difference, but after reading through all of the entries about it, most people don't notice it working at this dosage. One great thing about this medication is that the side effects seem to be minimal to most other medications I have taken. I notice that after I take it, I feel slightly nauseated, I get a headache, and I notice that my eyes have been somewhat blurry when trying to read. These are all not bothersome enough to go off of it. One positive thing about it so far is that it doesn't affect my sex drive the way antidepressants have in the past. For some, this is a huge plus. I will update again when my dosage has been increased."

I never got above 12 mg and didn't need it as it had a therapeutic benefit for me at that low dose. But I have a hx of autoimmune disorders with + ANA that may or may not have been lupus. Those were in remission for a long time. Lamictal turned it all back on, including messing up my bloodwork and throwing everything out of normal range again. I have been off Lamictal now for several weeks but am still having what is essentially a lupus flare - BAD. The infamous Lamictal rash appeared after about 6 weeks on the drug; we withdrew the drug, rechallenged, and the rash reappeared. It took a long time to go away. The only person who could dx this correctly was my rheumatologist. The derm MD and psych MD both blew it and encouraged me to continue using this drug, which was clearly not safe for me.

I was on Depakote until 2004 when a new doctor switched me to Trileptal which totally did nothing for stabilizing my moods. I went to a different doctor who actually knew her stuff and she put me on Lamictal along with Effexor XR. My moods are much more stable with Lamictal and I've lost a significantly noticeable amount of weight since starting the switch this September. People who saw me at Thanksgiving were surprised to see that I had lost so much weight! Don't bother with Depakote or Trileptal - the first drug causes weight gain, and the second drug barely does anything to stabilize moods. Lamictal rocks!"

I stopped the treatment due to the major side effects I was receiving. At the time I began taking the medication, I became increasingly irritable and frustrated with anything and anyone I came in contact with. I became extremely depressed and avoidant of everyone. I've always been a very social person. However, during my short treatment of Lamactil, I felt like I just wanted to be by myself all the time. I didn't want to go out with my friends, or even go out at all for that matter. Well, turns out that only two days ago, I received a correction from the doctor I had seen regarding my tests, and I don't have bipolar. This definitely explains the reasons I was experiencing almost every rare side effect of the medication. I do know how it feels though, I'm here to support anyone who needs some, whether its sticking in there with the medication, or just whatever."

Even on just the fourth day, I have an insatiable desire for alcohol. I have done very well in controlling this urge, but I find it very odd. Part of the reason this drug was prescribed was to help with my ""rage"" symptoms, where even the slightest adverse event would set me off (i.e. following someone on the highway if cut off, or punching a hole in the wall if I stubbed my toe -- you get the idea). At this low dose, I actually feel MORE prone to these feelings, as well as the experience of even the slightest offenses shutting me down completely. I have never been more afraid to leave the house or deal with people. My emotions are running wild... someone who raised their voice in a telephone conversation resulted in a COMPLETE mood change to the point of sobbing uncontrollably (this is unlike anything I've experienced in the past). Maybe I will break out of these feelings as the dosage is increased, but I am a bit disturbed that the medication seems to exacerbate the very symptoms it was intended to resolve.

I have been on this medication for coming up to two months. It was frustrating to begin with as I had to increase by 25mg every week so it took 3 weeks to get to 100mg. It is best to start this medication slowly as it can result in a serious rash. Going slow when depressed is difficult, you want to get to the theraputic dose ASAP. Anyway, enough of how you take this medication and onto what everyone wants to hear... does it work? This is where I don't want to tempt fate but I have to say I have now had 3 weeks depression free. This is after 18 months of depression. I am unipolar major recurrent depressive. In combination with 30mg esCitalopram I am doing well. They work well together for me. When I was on just esCitalopram I was up and down, one week up one week down or there abouts... and when I say up I mean normal. The lamictal has suceeded where the lithium failed. I also feel that it is a nicer drug than lithium, no more 3 monthly blood tests, no more weight gain and no more having to pee 3 times in the night. This medication has been described as the silver bullet for bi-polar. I think with time it's usefulness in unipolar depression will be realised. It was recently written about in the New England Journal of Medicine which praised the drug for depression.

Instead of feeling ""blah"" all the time, my mood is neutral for the most part. I feel normal. Little things don't send me spiralling anymore. I still get depressed now and then, but it takes a lot more to get me there (and that may improve as I stabilize on 200mg, which I understand is the minimum therapeutic dose). I have noticed that my appetite has also become more normal (I used to be a voracious eater). I also used to have a lot of anxiety (knot in chest, jitteriness) which completely disappeared as soon as I started taking Lamictal. I started on 25mg in the morning and worked up to 100mg raising it by 25mg a week. After I made it there with no rash, my doctor started increasing the dose more quickly. I started taking 100mg in the morning and 50mg at night (after 10 days, raised to 100mg morning, 100mg night). With each dose increase, I felt woozy for a couple of days but then that cleared up and I felt fine. On the topic of price, I only pay $20/month after insurance, which I find to be quite reasonable. However, Lamictal can be quite expensive (~$185/month) if you are uninsured. I have only noticed two side effects, both of which I consider to be very mild. First, I have noticed a headache that comes and goes (I never got headaches before starting Lamictal). It isn't very severe and seems to go away with aspirin. Second, I wake up hung over if I drink at all, even a half glass of wine. I don't seem to experience alcohol differently, my body just has a hard time recovering from it. When I first started (25-50mg) my legs sometimes ached as if I had exercised a lot the day before, but that has completely disappeared. On the whole, I highly recommend Lamictal if you have problems with depression but SSRIs make you manic. As someone whose problem is primarily depression (i.e. mania/hypomania is quite rare) -- I can't really s"

I ended up punching someone at a night club one night! I hadn't hit anyone since public school 30 years ago! I couldn't get ahold of my doctor so I just cut back the dosage and things began to get better fast. My appetite started coming back, the paranoia vanished, and the irritability went away. I guess when you give this drug to a mildly depressed person some strange stuff can happen! I am now at 150mgs./day and staying at this dosage till I get in to see the doctor.

The stuff below is still true, but I am slightly changing things now that I have been on the medicine for almost a year. The medicine is not controlling my seizures. It is helping. My EEGs are much better but not normal. I have been up to 450mgs of Lamictal and am currently at 350mgs. What I have noticed since I began is insomnia, occasional lack of balance, an itchy rash each time I went up in dose and a slightly fuzzy state of mind. This fuzzy state of mind increases with each AED (anti epileptic drug) I add to my pill box. My husband and I are looking at having a child in the next few years. They said that this is the best choice for people like me. I currently take 200mg in the AM and 100 in the PM. The heavy dose is in the AM to reduce the chance of insomnia. I only get the insomnia a few times a week. Any caffeine after 10 AM makes it worse (this is also Lamictal related). Melatonin is great for the nights I do have insomnia and you dont need an RX to get it. The balance thing isnt too bad, I am just more likely to lose it every once in a while in situations I would never have before. The fuzzy state of mind seems to primarily affect my pronouncation of words. I know very well what the word is, but how to pronounce it can be problematic to me. This does not happen all of the time, maybe 3x a week. Overall I really like the drug because after doing tons of research, the other drugs have much worse side effects than this one. I am not interested in the weight gain or bone loss. One other thing -being young, I am very sad not to be able to drink with my friends anymore."

I'm also using 1mg of Klonopin (AS NEEDED) for sleep. They work great together. Very happy. UPDATE 4.28.05 I have almost made it to six months on Lamictal 100mg at bed. I have to say that I am so amazed how well it's still holding up. My doc also uses .5 - 1 mg of Klonopin for sleep/anxiety at bed only. The combination seems to compliment the effects of the Lamotrigine in stablizing my BP quite well. I did notice, however, that about a month ago I did fall back into a slight period of mania.

I thought it was either low blood sugar, stress, not enough sleep...etc. All of you that have experienced a full blown mania accompanied with panic and anxiety know what I'm talking about.

I had to read through 57 pages of drug company instructions to the doctor to find out that pain is one of the infrequent side affects. My opinion is that it should be prominently listed as a side effect because I believe the drug caused the increased pain level. I had thought that maybe it decreased the level of the painkiller (percocet 7.5) I take on a consistent basis. that may be the case.

I met with my psychiatrist last week and we have decided that I do not need to increase my dosage to 200mg as previouly planned. 9-30-05- I have just completed my second week of 50mg. It has been a very unstable two weeks for me. I was either very agitated or extremely talkative with racing thoughts. Towards the end of the last week I began to feel somewhat even balanced emotionally. The pimples I noticed on my cheecks had gotten a little worse. Two days after I noticed the pimples, I woke up and had what looked like a heat rash on each cheeck,(not my entire face). I then was thinking about not continuing my medication but the next day the fine bumps on my cheecks began to clear up.So as for the last four days I have been feeling balanced and will be starting 100mg tonight. Hopefully things will begin to get better from this point. 9-23-05- I have just completed my first week of 50mg. I have noticed a small number of pimples on my face and upper chest. I have about four small pimples on each cheek,and two on my upper chest area. At this point they are not very noticable and I plan on continuing as planned. I have also been dealing with my mood swings. Unlike when I started at 25mg and felt very balanced I am becoming concerned about how unbalanced I am feeling now. Since I have started at 50mg I have been very very irritable and agitated with very short moments of being extremly talkative. I have not had any depressing moments but I have isolated myself from people because everything seems to be very upsetting and frustrating.

After months of trying random things (alternative stuff since i dont have insurance) I am glad to be on medication. I must say, I havent felt like this for three years (i was prescribed SSRI's for depression at first like many of us are when this i first started having trouble) My interests are coming back, I can read for hours on in just like I always used to, and I can stay motivated. My family has noticed a huge difference. But this barely started happening so I know not to get too excited yet.It is pretty expensive and I would be in trouble if I didnt have my parents. Remember there are alternatives though. (mexico..canada)I will keep updating this as I move up in dosage. Works well with proper diet and exercise. I take vitamins and I suspect this has helped me from experiencing side effects. 5-9-05 AWESOME!!! Nothing like it. I am slowly going up the dosage ladder. Everytime I up life seems to be more normal. I am pretty productive now. The only thing that kinda sucks is the occasional insomnia. I still get periods of racing thoughts and irritabilty but I am sure this can be corrected with another type of medicine. This happens after I up a dose or if i take it too late in the day. I really hope this doesn't stop working. I like having my life back. 5-26 Everytime i move up....life gets more normal.

I even started to fight with my fiance because every little thing annoyed the hell out of me!!). I have leveled off to a point where I have no anxiety at all now, however, I am really scared that I will experience the anxiety and irritability again when I increase to the 100mg and then really feel it when I increase to the 200mg next week. I am hoping that I only experienced it before because it was being introduced into my system and that I am now used to it so my body won't react that way.

At this point, my son is on 100mg a day, and his seizures are worse in number, however, the drop attacks have stopped, and he is dealing with myoclonic seizures.

I became very depressed and was using many sick days at work because I just couldn't function. Increasing zoloft only gave me awful side effects but no relief from the depression. Lamictal was suggested. The zoloft was reduced as my doctor slowly introduced lamictal. I began at 5mg and increased by 5 mg each week. I continued to suffer. This process seemed to take forever. I finally got up to 20mg and saw a difference. My energy was back and I could do several things in a day without feeling overwhelmed. I am continuing to increase by 5 mg. every 3-4 days until I reach 50 mg. I will see my doctor at that time and decide if I need to continue increasing. I seem to have no side effects. The worst side effects were from the zoloft when the lamictal was introduced (tremors and blurred vision). It seems the lamictal intensified the zoloft. The side effects disappeared once I was down to 50mg of zoloft. The doctor seems to think I may discontinue the zoloft and only use lamictal.

Now extremely fatigued about the last 2-3 weeks - after I get to work I can't keep my eyes open. Primary physician ruled out everything physical, so now thinking these are Lamictal side effects. After reading some reviews on this site, I went back to the PDR and sure enough, under the main AE tables, in text these are mentioned (for < 5% and > 1% of study subjects). Thinking I need to talk to psych Dr. about decreasing the dose. From what I've read on this site, it looks like my 400mg dose is fairly high - maybe ramp down to 200-300mg.

I have been taking the two drugs together for over 10 years now & have been seizure free for 14 months. I've had epilepsy for 37 years and this is the first time that I have ever considered myself seizure free. I take more of the medication than is normally prescribed for someone new to Lamictal, but being involved in the study I started at a low dosage that was gradually increased over 5 years. I have been on Lamictal for 15 years and keppra for 10 years. I've had Cat scans, wada tests, MRIs,depth electrodes, spinal taps and numerous other tests, some more than once. In 1981 I had brain surgery where part of my right temporal lobe was removed. This was believed to be the source of the seizures. I really had great hopes that this would resolve the problem, but this was not the cure for me. Not one particular drug is the solution for everyone who has epilepsy. You need to take whatever your doctor suggests for you in order to see if it works. There are new drugs being approved every day. Hopefully, you'll find the drug that works for you.

I'm currently at 100 mg and hope to be at my goal -200 mg- w/ in the next month or so. So far I can't say for sure if it's helping my mood. I'm also currently taking 30 mg of Lexapro.

Will continue to keep you all posted 8/25/05 I'm still only taking 100 mg because I feel as though I'm not ready to increase my dosage. I'm having horrible sleeping patterns - especially vivid, high emotional, exhausting dreams. I feel as though my brain has worked out all night long. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of the Lamictal or the Lexapro. My mood, currently, is low. I've been feeling generally depressed. I'm feeling discouraged with my drug combination and its ability to treat my symptoms. I will continue to try to increase my Lamictal dose, but am concerned that I may not be treatable - I've had rather treatment-resistance depression/anxiety and was hoping this might be my ticket out.....

This medicine has helped me so much. I have no idea where I would be now if it wasn't for Lamictal. I was having an extreme amount of trouble during 8th grade and 9th grade. I was not focusing in school and missing a lot of school because I was never feeling well. I was also having small seizures on the school bus, so I would have my mom pick me up after school because I didn't want to take the chance of having seizures in front of everyone. I was having frequent seizures daily (which we did not realize were seizures until later). By the time we realized what they were, it had already been a couple years. I had already distanced myself from my friends because I did not want them to know that I have Epilepsy. I used to always worry that I would start having a seizure in public, so I just stayed in my room all the time. I did homework and slept. I was always incredibly tired. I also played sports, and I used to always worry about having seizures during games or practices. I was ashamed. I decided early on that I was not going to tell anyone about my Epilepsy unless it was on a need to know basis. For instance, I told my teachers, coaches, boyfriends, and really close friends. I didn't want anyone else to know because I thought they would treat me differently, which a lot did when they found out (for example, my teammates eventually figured out something was different with me so they asked and I told them). Well I was put on Lamictal (it was the 1st drug they tried on me), and it worked. My seizures were becoming less and less frequent, and eventually we got me up to a dosage where I was completely seizure free. I was no longer having seizures on my school buses, or in cars, or in any situation. I finally felt free to hang out with my friends and not be worried that I'm going to have a seizure. I have been seizure free"

I have been prescribed lamotrigine to stabilise my mood and hopefully reduce anxiety. I started lamotrigine at 50 mg and the notorious rash appeared within four days of starting it. I asked my psychiatric nurse for advice and we both agreed that it would be best to continue with the treatment as I was feeling well and had no other symptoms. The rash was not irritating, though it spread to over my abdomen and down to my right knee -- that particular rash looked like prickly heat and was raised and pink. I also had a different type of rash along my right elbow and up to my wrist which was flat and looked like dark flecks of blood beneath the skin. The rash lasted for approximately two and a half weeks, and disappeared two days after increasing the dose to 100 mg daily. I do take the antihistamine levocetirizine (Xyzal) for hayfever anyway, but I decided to take chlorpheniramine (Piriton) in addition to that in an attempt to reduce the rash. I'm not sure if it really had any effect, since the rash appeared to fade of its own accord. I understand why the manufacturers and most doctors advise patients to discontinue lamotrigine at the first sign of any rash, however, I think that this may be mainly down to the fact that doctors fear that they will be sued if they do not give this advice. In reality I think that most people who get the rash develop the non-serious form and have nothing to fear. The real danger signs are when you have the rash and start to feel flu-like symptoms. Up until now I have yet to feel any effect from lamotrigine. Actually, only today have I felt a subtle change -- I can't quite describe it and in fact it might not be related to lamotrigine at all, but I'm hopeful that this drug will be useful either as a monotherapy, or at the very least I'm hoping it will form the ba"

My psychiatrist had put me on Geodon which I thought was a miracle drug for about six months or so. Then the muscles in my mouth started to get very rigid and stiff. I found that I would have uncontrollable tongue and lip movements. Then my throat began closing up. I cut down on my dosage from 120 mg a day to 60 mg a day and then to 40 mg a day. I did not want to get off the Geodon as it was working quite well for me, stabilized my uncontrolled spending (actually have saved quite a bit since beginning it) and my mood swings made my home members happy and content. My breathing got so bad that I had to sleep with my pillows propped up just to breathe. My husband did not want me to get off the Geodon and said, ""honey, every drug has side effects."" Good for him. Unfortunately, he is not me and I could not handle living like this and day to day my life became dreadful. I saw my psychiatrist who started me on Lamictal 25 mg. I titrated up until 200 mg. Along with the Lamictal I am taking Wellbutrin 300 mg and Effexor XR 300 mg for depression and bulimia. (Yeah, I'm quite the deck of cards, huh?) Well the Lamictal has brought back my old personality, minus the mood swings. I realize now that the Geodon made me very quiet and unemotional... to the point where I didn't have an interest in anything else but working. Didn't really care about my finches or cockatiel and fed them just because I had to. Now I appreciate my hobby and can actually ""feel"" emotions once again. I stopped reaching out to my friends on the Geodon and was actually a very logical individual. My husband loved the logical wife. Now on the Lamictal I love myself and again and appreciate my husband and daughter more naturally. So, all in all, I am very pleased with the Lamictal, a mood stabilizer.

At 50 mg twice daily, I started with the nightmares. But I was ok with that...That is, until I was admitted to the hospital for rebounds (off of OTC's and Zonegran). While I was in the hospital for steroid treatment, the doctor upped me quickly to 400 mg (200 twice a day). The first week or two, it was great. I went from a 8+ migraine EVERY day to a slight nagging headache every other day or so. Then, the side effects started kicking in. I started with a wierd shifting of my eyes back and forth when I was reading, which developed (within days) to blurry and double vision (listed as a ""not likely"" side effect). It got SO bad I couldn't see across the street or even my children. IN THAT CONDITION, I went to the eye doctor to find out what was going on. After a lengthy and uncomfortable examination, he told me my overall vision is fine and that I'm suffering from accomodation spasms. One eye is trying to accomodate for the other. He said this is one of the side effects referred to in the desktop reference all of the doctors have. I also got insomnia and drowsiness (I never knew you could have both until I actually experienced it...not fun), weight loss (minimal only), thirst, and the 'shakes' in my hands. My balance was all messed up from the accomodation problem. I had paged my neuro for help, but he didn't call back (imagine that, he never does and I'm going back to my primary who actually HELPED me and calls me back!). So, on my own and after talking with my Primary's office, I am tapering off and going back to Topamax. I left that (although it was effective) because of the crazy tingling in my toes and fingers. I'd rather feel like that than to not see. I can still function with tingling toes, but I COULD NOT function without sight very well (especially since it was scary fast and sudden). 200 mg a day was not enough, so this drug will not work for me."

I'm still itchy, but a bit better. Update - I wasn't given the appropriate ""pack"" by the pharmacist.

After a few weeks of not feeling much different. I decided to reduce the dose back to 200mg a day. Bad choice, I was depressed to the point of thinking about self-harm and suicide. My Dr agreed although that, even if it sent me 'down', that it was worth trying to reduce the dosage considering the huge costs involved. He then decided to put me up to 400mg a day. I tried to increase the dose, but ended up extremly dizzy to the point where I could hardly stand up, nausea, vomiting, a mind splitting migraine and generally feeling so horrible, I couldn't bring myself to take the 400mg dose today. I went back to 300mg. I am also taking Edronax, so I am hoping, that with time, it will increase the effects of the Edronax, and make life a bit more liveable. Til I feel 'well' again.

But I did it, before I didn't want to do it, if you catch my drift. Having overdosed before, I didn't want to wake in the middle of the night, and decide to take the whole damn lot! I also take Tegretol and Seroquel as mood stabilisers and to help me sleep. I take Serepax for severe anxiety and panic attacks.

I was so convinced Lamotrogine was the best bet, I was determined to tough it out, believing this would pass. Couldn't eat or talk. After five days of excrutiating pain the muscle tension was so bad I went to emergency because eventually I could barely open my mouth. They gave me cogentin to get it out of my system ASAP. When I told my Psychiatrist he was skeptical and pursuaded me to try it again. I so desperately wanted this to be the one, I tried it again. Same thing happened. He said this side effect had never been reported and he would have to report it."

From the first 25 mg., my head felt like it was exploding with anxiety/agitation. I thought it would get better but it never did. By the time I got to 200, the depression was worse than ever and the agitation made it 100x worse. I've fought bipolar for 15 years and that's as scared as I've ever been. Particularly when knowing that this drug is a miracle for others. Anyway, I think my reaction was unusual but don't just keeping increasing the dosage if things are getting worse while thinking they'll just magically disappear."
7/25/2005 4:28:20 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"Trying Lamictal July 25th - Update: Well, unfortunately Lamictal did not work out for me. I started to feel more irritable/emotional than usual and then started experiencing abnormal spotting/bleeding problems, even though it was not my menstrual cycle time. I do take Estrostep (birth control) pills to help regulate my cycles, so I guess this type of spotting/bleeding in between cycles can happen with Lamictal and birth control. However, since it took me over a year to find the right birth control pill to get me regulated, I decided not to stop taking the Estrostep. And decided to stop the Lamictal instead. I saw my doctor last week and told him all this, he said it was up to me and ok if I just wanted to stay on the current regimen of Lithium and Wellbutrin. I was kind of hoping to get off the Lithium, mainly for fear of long-term side effects...but at this time, it is working and I do not have any bad side effects from it. So...I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but just an FYI: if you are on birth control and taking Lamictal, let your doctor know if you have breakthrough/abnormal bleeding. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 9 years ago and was taking Lithium & Wellbutrin for the last 5yrs or so. My new doctor wants me to try to wean off of the Lithium, due to all its long-term side effects and the need for labwork/haven't had any major manic or depressive episodes for several years, so he said Lamictal would be a good fit for me. Well, I'm on my 17th day and so far, not too bad. I am currently up to 50mg a day...slowly working up to 100mg/day. The only real noticeable side effect was sleepiness. I switched to taking the pills at night and that seemed to help. No rash or any other major side effects. I just worry about stopping the Lithium...its been good for me over the years at keeping me stable. I know that he will take me off of it gradually...but still a little scared of that.

First, it took most of the depression away, I am also more patient and open with my family, less angry with the world in general, and the OCD thoughts and habits have lessened. I was diagnosed as Borderline 10 years ago and dismissed it as misogyny, but recently went back into therapy and was diagnosed as ""somewhere in the bipolar spectrum"" with OCD and anxiety issues as well. I tried an antidepressant which made me feel like an ungrounded electric wire, then Seroquel whose side effects outweighed it's benefits, then finally Lamictal with Lunesta for my anxiety/insomnia (which got me off the Xanax I've been taking for years). So far, so good, I wouldn't say I'm cured, but things are definately looking better. Side effects I've noticed are slight acne and increased sweating."

I'm 40 and haven't felt this capable and hopeful since my 20's. First time to be diagnosed BP II and still learning a lot -- was skeptial till reading more. Over the years have tried Tofranil, Pamelor, Zoloft, Effexor, Prozac, and Paxil ... maybe more. Xanax as needed for anxiety. Antidepressants never worked or did for a few weeks. (Did it really work or did I just cycle out?) This is my modified diary: Felt a small lift first few days. Day 4 had the worst depression/sadness EVER. Days 4 & 5 had horrible, debilitating headache all day. First few weeks very gasy, but getting better now. Had some itching around mouth and lips days 6 & 7 but went away quickly. Small rash on tops of feet after 2 weeks -- may have been from sandals. Periods of sleepiness and insomnia with no rhyme or reason. Adjusting dosing time seems to not make a difference -- still too early to tell. Pressure/fluid in ears after 2 weeks and continues some (BP on the Bay mentioned this -- was wondering if I was the only one -- haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere). Results in noise sensitivity. Menstrual cramps have come several days before ""time"" and hope this isn't a problem that continues. Some trouble focusing eyes -- just takes a minute. Not craving sweets as much and when I do eat something, it's not as satisfying. Appetite is down but no weight loss. GOOD STUFF: When engaging with public: not too talky, not talking over them, all very appropriate exchanges and not ""why did I just divulge all that/hold that person verbally hostage!"" More playful with spouse and not hypersensitive to perceived criticism. Not seething with anger and resentment from past betrayals. Still able to feel emotions appropriate for situation. Less withdrawn and not as overwhelmed. I actually BBQ'd today and didn't ask for SO help. Just went out there and did it, not being afraid of messing something up/doing it wrong. (It's the small st"

Update 10.Jul.2005: 20 months so far, and Lamictal is still amazing: it works, with no side effects on me. Interesting: A stormy relationship and breakup with a girlfriend (also suffering from a mental condition) six months ago caused the need for a 1-month temporary increase in dosage (100mg AM + 200mg PM, 300mg total). After two months on the temp dosage, the original dosage (100mg AM and PM, 200mg total) was returned to and still works like magic. It's a true God send! Update 01.Nov.2004: Lamictal is still amazing; it works, and no side effects. A true God send! My Health-Insurance Provider, original and present, covers the med, which helps greatly. Oct 2003: This med is nothing short of amazing; it has completely eliminated my Ultra-Rapid-Cycling Manic-Depression Type-II, at only 200mg/day (taken as 100mg 2x/day). It is especially effective eliminating the paralyzing depression that would last for days (or sometimes longer). The anxiety and irritability have all but vanished. As for the hypomania, it is now only very mild and lasts for only an hour or two: long enough to help with creativity, but not long enough to cause problems. It also eliminates the dreaded crash that would always immediately follow the hypomania. Titrating upwards to 200mg, in 25mg increments, starting at 25mg, was a drag. At 75mg I developed swelling of the Parotid Glands, which required me to titrated downwards to 12.5mg until the swelling reversed, and then titrate upwards a second time (but at a quicker five day titration period rather than the initial seven day period). Fortunately there were no problems titrating upward second time. I did experience other more traditional side effects initially: headaches (which I never get), difficulty focusing my eyes, occasionally localized itchy skin and strangely popping of my ears. The headaches could be a pain, especially if you’re not accustomed to getting them. The focusing problem wa"

He set me up with a ""startup"" dosepack which increased my dosage by a set amount about 3 times during the life of the dosepack. He showed me where I should be (in terms of how many more days) if the drug was going to work for me. However, on my SECOND day of taking the meds, I felt a certain ""twinkle"" as if I was already feeling better. By the time I got to the day he had indicated, I felt better than ""twinkly!"" I felt totally different! And all of it better! Lamictal is a mood stabilizer rather than an antidepressant. He had debated many times about giving me a mood stabilizer (Lithium in particular) but was afraid of bad side effects, including the very real possibility of suicide (Lithium is very toxic in overdoses). Finally he gave in with Lamictal. I haven't had 100% perfectly stable moods on this med, but things have been happening around me that have vastly increased my stress level, so I'm blaming that for my ""low"" periods. I feel a lot more emotional while on these pills, but not to the point where I can't handle it. On the antidepressant, all my emotions were just gone - suppressed. Of course I haven't been on this drug very long, and I must watch out for this serious (possibly even fatal) rash side effect, but I look forward to it helping me be more positive and forward-looking than I have in years!"

Topamax did nothing for my mood but I did'nt stop because of the much wanted weight loss (Lost 35# in a year). But there's more to that story and I'll tell you about that when I rate that med! My advice to those of you on Lamictal is to wade through the S/E which go away after a week or so.(I had more then most) because it has a dramatic effect on preventing depressive episodes.

I hate Geodine, don't need Seroquil I gained over 50 lbs. on both of these drugs which I have lost since December. I have not ever been psychotic and I won't take that sort of drug. I also take 150mg of Wellbutrin, 1 mg Klonipin, 400 mg. Trazadone. I still only sleep about 4-5 hours per night. If I don't wake up and get more sleep I am grateful.

This was normal to me but noticed that it did affect my interpersonal relationships. Once my brother saw a psychiatrist and was dx with Bipolar Disorder and we have similar symptoms. He let me try this and lo and behold the psychiatrist said the same thing to me. It seems that the criteria to meet this dx is broader and less severe symptoms have finally been given their place in someone's life with the new ""Bipolar II Disorder"" dx.

When I would first start taking it I would do OK with it and would have no problems or side effects. I must admit when I first started taking it I was concerned about Stevens Johnson Syndrome and it caused a great deal of fear in me. As I took the Lamictal and I felt better I didn't worry as much. The only problem I had was when I reached 100 mgs. I would start having heart palpatations. My pdoc told me that we could stop the Lamictal and start on it slower and we did this several more times with the same outcome. I finally gave up on it but hated to because for some reason I enjoyed taking the Lamictal. It was easy to take and I didn't suffer any other side effects. My pdoc said she could have given me something for the heart palpatations but she didn't feel like the Lamictal was helping my mood swings like it should so she took me off of it. I really wish the Lamictal had worked for me because I did like it.

At that time I started going to a psych again and he prescribed me lamictal. I have had zero problems with it.

6/18/2005 9:54:17 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Seems to work I've been on Lamictal for almost a year and a half. I was initially put on it b/c of a manic episode I experienced while on 40mgs/day of Prozac, followed by a huge crash, and my doctor wanted to stabilize me. I was immediately taken off the Prozac and am essentially forbidden to take any more SSRI's. Since starting Lamictal I have also been on Zyprexa. I suffer mostly from Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder but my doctor has also diagnosed me as Bipolar (I guess they are all related). The Lamictal definitely stabilized my moods on 200mgs a day, until a few months ago, when it seemed to stop working. I suffered a huge despression for several weeks along with a constant, rapid cycling of anxiety ridden thoughts. So rather than put me back on an SSRI my doctor increased me to 300mgs a day of Lamictal (a very large dose), and I started taking 2.5 mgs of Zyprexa a day (a small dose). That seems to have jump-started the therapeutic effects and I now feel much better. Overall, since starting the Lamictal I no longer get extremely angry or obsessive, and it helps with depression and anxiety. The Zyprexa helps too (and also helps me sleep), but I really see the Zyprexa as a supplement to the Lamictal b/c I'm on a very low dose of Zyprexa. I will also say that I have not experienced any side-effects on Lamictal -- it has been very mild on my system. I intend to stay on it."

Developed swollen lymph glands, very stiff neck, inching, GI disturbances, and flu like symptoms (without nausea or loss of appetite). I demanded to have a complete blood lab test as I felt something was not right. Sure enough, my liver enzymes are significantly elevated. I am taking no other medications. I had a baseline (before Lamictal) set of blood labs that were all Okay prior to me starting Lamictal. AST went from 17 u/l to 580 u/l on Lamictal (significant liver cell death). Upon discontinuing Lamictal and doing a repeat liver panel 30 hours after my last dose, my AST dropped to 150 u/l (still abnormally high) but going in the right direction. FDA Medwatch report filed. The most disappointing aspect of this is that before the liver sickness kicked in gear, I was beginning to notice positive effects on my mood. Please take warning and get your liver functions periodically tested when starting Lamictal. Good Luck."
6/15/2005 5:20:42 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Dreadful Side Effects. I was on Lamictal 200mg for bipolar mood stabilization. And while it did seem to stabilize my moods, the side effects were debilitating on the full dosage. I am active, energetic, very busy and INDEPENDENT. This medication made me physically unstable: clumsy, off balance, and uncoordinated. It made my vision blurry, doubled and I could no longer drive a car, due to the fact that my 20/20 vision had gone to pot and I could no longer read the street signs. I lost all confidence in my ability to be aware of myself and my surroundings at the same time, if that makes sense. I felt very out of touch I guess you could say..The most disturbing of the side effects was the memory loss. It got pretty scary when I could no longer remember how things got where they were, or conversations I had had earlier that day. All of a sudden appointments were missed, important dates were forgotten. I am a student and I need to be able to study and retain information, Lamictal greatly slowed down my thought processes and it took me much much longer to process lectures and/or information from my books. I do a bit of teaching and it became hard to teach at the level that I was used to. It took me longer to get things said the way that I mean to say them and it took great concentration it seemed in order to make sense.. if that makes any sense : ) Either way, Lamictal was not good for me. I am normally quick, sharp and doing a million things at once and on Lamictal I felt like my brain ( and my body) was stuck in quicksand."

So far, I have been holding my breath, wondering if, finally, this might be the real thing - a medication that works - because I feel a whole hell of a lot better these last few weeks than I have in years.

I have suffered from major depression with dysthymia (among other things) almost as long as I can remember, and over the years I have been prescribed every known SSRI, several tricyclics, and one or two other mood stabilizers, with no luck whatsoever in improving my mood. All of them caused awful side effects, ranging from insomnia and jitters to flu-like symptoms and nausea, to hair loss, memory impairment, headache, etc. On Topamax, my skin refused to heal from minor wounds, much of my hair fell out, I couldn't remember anyone's name, and I had mood swings from hell. But at least my appetite was almost nil (lol!) And I've heard from several other people on message boards that they've had a similar response with Lamictal to that which I had on the Topamax. For me, however, Lamictal has been really incredible. Once I hit 100mgs, I started to feel cheery, noticed myself singing in the shower, daring to smile and to entertain the possibility of a positive future.

So far it's been working out great. Just the usual side effects at first, a little itchy and dry mouth but that seems to go away after a month or two. My only complaint however is how sleepy it made me feel. I was nearly hospitalized with depression so my doc upped the dose to 150mg twice a day and I thought I could take both of the doses in the morning. When 8pm rolled around I would get extremely sleepy no matter what time of the day I took it. Strange. I was sleeping 15-18 hours a day for weeks, I had to withdrawal from my classes and go home early from work all the time, which is not something anyone wants to experience. For some reason if I take one dose in the morning and at night the problem is non-existant. Thank goodness. Just something to keep in mind while taking Lamictal. I would highly recommend this as a mood stabilizer or an alternative to Lithium with little to no side effects. No nausea and no weight gain. Just a smooth stable mood (finally) :D"

I took just about every antidepressant on the market for the next fifteen years while I continually fought ongoing bouts of depression. They either didn't help at all or helped for short periods of time. I also had a lot of bad side effects. Every aspect of my life was affected by my depression as it got worse and worse every year. I couldn't hold a job for any length of time, had problems with relationships with both family and friends and often stayed in bed for days experiencing severe anxiety and a sense of utter hopelessness. Three years ago, I spent two months researching clinical depression as well as Bipolar disorder. It was only then that I realized I had been misdiagnosed from the beginning. I have Bipolar II which is far more difficult to recognize than Bipolar I. I also began researching medications and decided to try Lamictal. After studying dozens of clinical studies, I was concerned about developing a rash which can be life threatening. Therefore, I decided to start with a very small dosage, 12 1/2 mg. In two weeks, I raised it to 25mg. Every two weeks after that, I raised it another 12 1/2mg until I was on 300mg. I have been using it for the past two and a half years and have never had any side effects. It is the first medication that has ever helped me, and I only hope that it continues to do so.

This medication for bipolar has some use, but that use is mainly for depression and therefore this medication should not be used alone without a proper mood stabiliser. Me personally I will never take this ever again and this is why... For most people, including myself, this medication stops working after a while and this is just what anti-depressants when given to bipolar people - this is why i noticed people on here are taking very large dose's, it stops working so they increase the dose. This medication cause's insominia! When I realised how much this problem was effecting my sleep I then realised what a huge problem it was for my condition overall. I couldn't sleep properly at all - De stabilising This medication does nothing for anxiety but increase anxiety! - Again not very mood stabilising to be a nervous wreck. Gives a dry mouth - very dry mouth, similar to that of lithium. To cut a long story short, this lamotrigine is a drug made for epilepsy and not all eplileptic drugs work for bipolar. This drug is good for depression in the short-term!...BUT this drug will make your condition, if taken alone, worse in the Long-term. This is not an anti-manic and therefore will not stabilise your mood. Its such a shame the drug company whos makes this drug has made so much money for something it is not. If you taken any of the SSRI's before and you think you could take that for 20-30years at the same dose with not other medication - then this drug is for you and you should feel great - you only have depression not manic depresssion!"

This med was excellent for pulling me out of depression, but ultimately I got highly agitated on it and had to stop.

I have not had any of the rashes or other dangerous side effects as described in case studies. It has narrowed the parameters if my manic/highs & my depressive/lows. It works even better when I smoke Buds. My mood has become more stable than I can ever remember. I have noticed a slight tick in some muscles (eye, shoulder & foot). But all things considered the good out weighs the bad & these twitches are not even that bad as compared to my being an out of control & dangerous sociopath.

Also, we should remember that a BP Type I and a BP Type II diagnosis are very different in terms of severity of manic symptoms. Although I am most certainly BP II my main feature is depression. This does not mean I am NOT BP. I NEVER had any success with SSRI's, Tricyclics, etc. but Lamictal is a great mood stabilizer with antidepressant properties for me. It may not work for everyone, but it is proven to be a valid mood stabilizer for BP disorder in clinical trials. Although we can all attest to our own experiences, we cannot speak authoritatively on chemical make-up of medications or question other's diagnosis. Dx Bipolar II with moderate to severe depression and mild to moderate hypomania. I am on my third trial of Lamictal as a monotherapy. Developed rash on every trial including this one, but my new pdoc is taking a wait and see on my latest rash which is accompanied by swollen lymph nodes and of course the ever present mild headache. For some reason even at a very low dose I develop the rash after several months even with no increase in dosage. This drug is the only drug to help me out of literally dozens I have tried over the years. Cannot tolerate any antidepressants and they don't help much anyway. As far as I am concerned there is no side effect I can't tolerate (within reason of course) to feel this normal. I feel like I am coming out of a very looooooonnngggg dark night of the soul. Once I get past the rash we may add Zonegran to the mix since it has weight loss benefits and I am 100lbs. overweight."

It does appear to help a bit with depression, but not totally. The downside for me: I do have to take this with food, or I end up with extreme headaches that are hard to get rid of. I also have to take a sleeping pill in order to get to sleep as the Lamictal will keep me up after the evening dose. Able to get in touch with my emotions more easily (because of the drug??) All in all, this is working better than the other anti-manic medications I've taken so far. *********Update********** I just raised my dose to 100 mgs. It seems to be that after each 25 mg. increase, I go through crying spells where my emotions are totally out of control and I cry at the drop of a hat or a wrong word said, headahces, insomnia, flu like symptoms, severe depression and total lack of appetite that lasts for about a week and 1/2. After that week and 1/2, only the lack of appetite side effect remains. I then go on to feeling increased energy, am much more stable, do not have any crying spells, and only get headaches if I forget to eat...there are hunger headaches and then there are Lamictal headaches.....I know the difference! I need to force myself to eat with Lamictal so I don't get what I refer to as the Lamictal headache. So now, I've reached my stopping point on Lamictal - or so my doctor thinks. From what I've been feeling so far after I get through these side effects with each increase, I feel like this drug is really given me a great deal of stability....fiancee and friends have even commented on this. They even know to the DAY when I have had a dose increase my mood changes. They know how long it's been in my system and is leveling off by mood changes. This is a very interesting drug for me. I am surprised at the depression effect it causes during each dose increase though before I feel better again. _______________________________"

My doc prescribed Lamotrigine, and things are very much better. (After 1 year on Lamotrigine) It took 6 months (at least) to get to an effective dose of Lamotrigine. I take 600mg: 3 200mg pills at bed time. Now I have much more mild and less frequent depressions. Instead of the 15 days I spent sick a couple of years ago, I spent 2 this year. Side effects: After taking my meds I have a very obvious balance problem. Also I feel very sleepy beginning 1 hour after taking the meds. The side effects are still there when I wake in the middle of the night, but they are gone before I wake up after 6+ hours of sleep. The side effects are big enough that I would never want to take my meds and then walk a long way or drive. Lamotrigine didn't fix everything. Now trying Depakote + (less) Lamotrigine. (After 18 months -- 2005-04-22) I am now taking 500mg Lamotrigine and 1500 mg Depakote. The depakote makes the effective dose of Lamotrigine equivalent to 1000mg. (Ask your Doc, but mine says there are many people on much more than this.) My doc and I are still lookin to get my symptoms down to almost no depressed days. The lack of ballance symptom is almost gone. I no longer worry about walking right after taking my meds. I am not likely to fall over. However I am now just very slightly off balance all day. The sleepiness continues at the same level, I wouldn't want to drive after taking my meds."

After 3 or 4 weeks I would start to improve and after several days my anxiety would escalate. I always reported that on Amitriptiline (75mg) I had become manic several times when I was younger but most of my docs did not think I was bipolar. Then I decided to see a younger one and she put me on Lamictal. First 3 days, itchiness and weird feelings, after that no side effects, and the same thing happened every time the dose was increased for about 3 days always. I started feeling better after reaching 100mg, now on 200mg. for 2 months. Let's see how long it lasts. After around 6 or 8 weeks I am having a depressive episode. Not as bad as they used to be but I don't know yet how deep it is going to get. Just put a call to my Pdoc.--The depression subsided on its own. It did not get as bad as it used to, I am doing just fine now still with the same 200mg a day. After more than 10 days started to be unable to fall asleep and waking up at 4 in the morning (I normally do so at 5)I was having some irritability. For 2 days took 2 clonazepam and fell asleep 2 hrs after my normal hour and woke up again at 4. The 3rd day took 2 clonies with a benadryl. Fell asleep like a rock but still getting more agitated. I did not want either become habituated to more clony neither go manic so I increased to 250 and then 300 the Lamictal and although I'm still waking up earlier, I can go to sleep at my regular hour and the agitation subsided. After a couple of months I am back with depressive ideation. I wonder if 400 mg would do for the stabilization even when the manufacturer says that more than 200 mg have not proved to be better. I have to wait almost a month till next appointment. Let's hope if there is another switch from now till then. I definitely prefer to be higher than lower.

Lithium was effective for a few years in the 1970s until I became toxic then stayed stable for a few years. Also in this time I had many different hospitalizations/ therapies including hypnosis, behavior modification (an inpatient token economy system) various forms of meditation and of course counseling, counseling, counseling! Several serious suicide attempts were made during these years and the suicidal ideations were very frequent. I had many negative experiences with ""the system"" & boycotted it completely for a number of years until a required Psych eval for my Gastric bypass surgery made contact with a Psychiatrist unavoidable--found one who made me feel like a human--not a symptom or disorder which gave me confidence to seek help from him in my later crisis! After many (almost 40) years of treatment for what was eventually determined to be Bipolar disorder I finally have a dr/medication combo that seems to be working! For the 11 years prior to last Dec my main presenting symptom was depression for which I took Celexa & then switched to Lexapro after my gastric bypass surgery. In Dec 2004 I suddenly went into a tailspin of up/down/down more (suicidal thoughts for 1st time in years--scary!) /up-up & up---can't sleep--- cycling very rapidly. Was sent to an intensive outpatient therapy program where I learned how much the Drs had learned about Bi-polar in the last few years (in the past I had been told that such rapid cycling was impossible and that what I now know to be hypomania was ""some other condition"").

Others seem to have benefited greatly from this med, but I reacted badly all around. Even when starting with 12.5 mg per day, I got immediately tired, out-of-it and, in retrospect, more aggitated physically anxious. I worked my way up to 50 mg, at which point I experienced a full-blown panic attack. Needless to say, the Lamictal trial was over. Even at the low doses I was on, I also experienced aches and tightness in my lower back and groin. I also experienced some sexual dysfunction (primarily inability to attain erection), which I think is pretty unusual in that regard. Really a shame, though, because I've read so many other good reports on it. In the mean time I'm still looking for a mood stabilizer that works and doesn't have some sort of intolerable side effect... The curse of being med-sensitive, I guess.

For one thing your probabily gonna get side effects unless your lucky, I'm afraid unless they are really serious i.e the rash you need to first talk to your doctar take his advise and then grim and bear it. Not quit after one or two days. I am now up to 150mg. Each time i increase it I feel wonderful, however this feeling subsides after a week then I feel agitated and slightly depressed. I did get side effects such as memory loss and heart palpitations but they pass after a week. I think the good feeling I get could be a touch of hypomania as I do feel on top of the world, and then I crash. I'm hoping as I get up to 200mg that my mood will level out. I will keep you updated. Update 1 Went back into depression after being on 150mg, and stayed there until increased to 200mg a few days ago. So don't really know how things will turn out. hopefully for the better. UPDATE 2 13/5/05 Now I'm up to 275mg and feeling well. Its quite amazing I no longer get fully depressed anymore, and now at times I feel normal and the further I increase the dose the better it gets. A smile is never far from the surface these days and I have a little chuckle. I no longer have mixed states. The only major problems that persist is anger, but this is not as intence as before lamictal. I still have insomnnia which I think is a side effect of the drug as it tends to fade after about a month on each dose, but I was never a grear sleeper anyway.

I would at some point like to get to the point where I can only take one drug, the Lamictal, but I am too afraid to try to change anything - I can't afford the downtime or any more ""setbacks"" financially or otherwise because of a failed experiment. But at the same time I am concerned about what other conditions long-term use of such drugs may cause since nobody ""really knows"" why such drugs work. I believe my bipolar disorder was brought on by, if not actually caused by, being ""overprescribed"" antidepressants & other drugs - at one point taking Effexor, Wellbutrin, a round of steroids for an illness, at the same time in the process of chemotherapy induced menopause and taking Tamoxifen which plays with the hormonal balance further.

And still to this day have trouble with my eyes... one year later. Just think of what could have happened had I listened to my doctor and ""just push through the rash it will go away""... Once the lymph glands in my neck swelled up to the size of small footballs, and the lymph glands under my arm pits and on my ears started popping out, and I starting feeling burning sensation on my skin, instead of a pleasant itchy feeling, I put MYSELF in the emergency room and had a shot of Prednisone (Methyl Prednisolone) and then a weeks worth of Cortico Steroid by pill to force the adverse reaction to calm down. Then after I got back to normal, slowly... my eyes were messed up. It was horrible for me... to not be able to sleep at night because of burning sensation in my eyes from eye lids sticking to eye balls. couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours (sometimes only 2) at a time for more than 3 months. It turned me into a monster due to lack of sleep and constant irritability. The trip to the emergency room and the 6 month long bout with dry eye syndrome (read not being able to sleep for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time without your eyeballs literally sticking to your eye lids, and burning like HELL) it was nothing short of hell. I should have gotten tested for genetic based intolerance to this (poisonous to me) drug. I don't believe in taking any drug off the market, but for those who trust in their doctors, and who cannot do research for themselves... it should be mandatory to be tested for possible horrific drug reactions / allergic reactions before taking this drug... Pharmacogenetic testing. I would recommend Omega3 EPA, C, E, B-6, B-12, and Folic Acid, and Zinc.

In approximately 5 months I lost 36 pounds without any dieting or exercise. It does curtail appetite somewhat and seems to be especially helpful in decreasing obsessions and compulsions related to food. I found it easier to eat normally because i just didn't feel drawn to junk foods etc...I was able to make normal healthy choices and eat until I was full. In addition I am convinced that it affected my metabolism because I just continued to lose weight when I could see no reason for it. Looking into side effects I found that a less common side effect was weight loss. I guess I am one of the lucky ones. I hope you are too. When you take a number of psychiatric drugs to control bipolar etc.. it is common to gain weight so it is nice to have one that counter acts that.

After taking several drug cocktails over these few years, including Lithium for over a year, Lamictal, combined with Effexor, has helped me tremendously. My moods are a lot more stable and less debilitating than with any other combo of meds. I am convinced the Lamictal plays a huge role in this, as neither Effexor alone, nor Effexor combined with Lithium, was able to help me this much. Accepting the fact that I will most likely have to take meds for the rest of my life has been incredibly difficult, but worth it, given the ""normalcy"" I have been able to achieve. I was in psychotherapy for years before I was diagnosed, and since my diagnosis as well, and I have found that with Lamictal and Effexor I have been able to more fully utilise my psychotherapy and really get myself together. I had no significant side effects with the Lamictal, but am definitely thankful that it is covered by my insurance, because otherwise I definitely could not enjoy the benefits of this drug."

Hopefully in the next 10 days I can resolve this Catch 22--if a neurologist will see me for a non-neurological problem!!!

I sleep 8 hours every night and my mood is level now. I don't know yet if this is because I'm just coincidentally at an acceptable level, or because these two meds together are my magical combination. Only time will tell.

I'm not sure of my classification, but I would say cyclothymia. If I am going to go into even mild mania, it happens quickly. I don't have deep depression, but I do get physically depressed. I just don't feel like doing anything. From what I can tell, the Lamictal has helped to prevent my almost instantaneous flip in moods. I have always been a patient person, but annoying repetitive noises or people really get to me now. I get a extreme adrenaline rush, and extremely warm feeling. I also tend to get very red in the face with anger. I can usually control myself, but I just want to scream or hit something inanimate. The Lamictal has helped to slow this down, or prevent the sudden hormone and chemical imbalance. I'm not sure why I do this, or if it really is the Manic Depression coming through. I just know that afterwards, if I am not medicated already, I cannot come down from these feelings and I just hate everything. My thoughts go at a million miles an hour."

Over that time I've gained over 30 lbs. despite daily exercise. Recently my doctor started me on Lamictal (very low dose 12 1/2 mgs. for one month, then moving up 12.5 mgs. every month). I'm now up to 50 mgs. and I have been able to reduce my Depakote to 1000 mgs. Ideally, I will move up on the Lamictal and get off the Depakote altogether. So far I have no side effects. I have tried every medication under the sun, all with horrible side effects (mostly anxiety). This is the best I have felt in a very long time...I just hope it continues. Update: I finally got to 112.5 mgs. of Lamitical and down to 500 mgs. of Depakote, and after about 1 1/2 weeks at these levels I suddenly got severe panic and anxiety out of nowhere. I've been cycling like crazy, and waking up in the middle of the night suddenly feeling like my airway has been closed off; my heart is pounding out of my chest. I've got just about every panic/anxiety symptom known to man now...and I had been symptom free for over 7 years. I'm crying at the drop of a hat as well. My doctor told me that in rare cases lamictal can cause fairly profound anxiety. Lucky me. Now I'm back down to 50 mg. and back up to 100 mg. Depakote. I still don't feel particularly well, but it has only been about 4 days. In the end, if this is the ultimate outcome for me with Lamictal, I'll take my 30 lb. weight gain and stay happy on Depakote any day."

The only negative is that it is very expensive. Expense shouldn't concern you if it is that effective. Therefore, I'd mortgage my house to keep taking it.

My doctor diagnosed my as Bipolar II because I had mostly depressive incidents with hardly any ""up"" moods. She put me on the starter program of Lamictal. I didn't feel any different the first 2 weeks when I was on 25 mg. The third week when I moved up to 50 mg, I immediately felt better. I woke up and actually felt like getting out of bed. It was the first time in many months. I was so happy that something was finally working. However, my happiness was short-lived. After another week, I developed a rash all over my body. It wasn't the life-threatening kind that the drug makers warn about, but obviously my body was having a reaction to the drug. I had to quit taking the Lamictal. Now my doctor wants me to take Lithium and I am more scared of that than I am of the depression. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I wish that I could have stayed on Lamictal and I would recommend the drug to anybody. If your doctor is smart, they'll have you start off slowly, like I did.

I can't begin to tell you how much I've missed and the mess I made of my life. Now finally as a last resort a doctor put me on lamictal and I'm returning to a life I lived 30 yrs ago. If you are a parent and you wake up one day and your child is no longer there in his mind don't waste his life with psychologists and poisonous psychological medicine which cause panic disorder and psychosis and do nothing for the manic depression. Take his precious life to a GOOD psychiatrist and tell him about LAMICTAL. Someone could have saved my life with this medicine long ago but not soon enough. After being on Ativan for 25 years I’m clean after heart surgery, I’m clean of antidepressants which cause delusions and hallucinations after Risperdal, I’m clean after shock treatment, I’m clean after every mood stabilizer, I’m clean ALL BECAUSE OF LAMICTAL. I only wish I had this 30 years ago because when I look back now its almost too scary to remember the only good part of my life is my childhood. I’m hoping that what life I have left is a calm and peaceful one if not for myself then for all who are around me. The only way they see me is for what I was not for who I am becoming. I wish that I could go far away so people would only know me now instead of the ill part of my life.

I have never had the problem. I seem to remember reading some things about a side effect concerning eyes, but can't remember. Sometimes doctors try one thing after another and they don't think of the consequences it can have on a patient making their situation worse or even deadly.

Until about a year ago, I was treated for major depression, with no mood stabilizers. I was having a severe week-long episode of depression every month, followed by a week of hypomania. More recently, have been taking 400 mg Lamictal, for over six months. Also taking Zoloft, lithium and Zyprexa.

Over the years I've tried tricyclics, SSRIs, and the atypical antidepressants with absolutely no results (well, except for the side effects). I dreaded every new day and looked forward only to going to bed at night. I had no energy, enjoyed no activities -- my whole life was one big chore to get through. I was also fearful, anxious and hyperalert all the time. Alcohol was the only thing that offered temporary relief. A savvy nurse practitioner started me on Lamictal. After 3 days I started feeling better but figured it was a fluke. After 2 months, I have never felt this good in my entire life. The knot in my stomach has finally unclenched. I am much calmer and much less irritable. It's not even so much that I feel giddy happy -- it's as if this curtain has lifted between me and the rest of the world, and I feel fully engaged with the world and my own emotions for the first time. Some people talk about the deadening effect of some anti-depressants -- that they don't feel the highs and lows that they once did. My experience on Lamictal has been just the opposite. I felt dead inside before, and now I'm free to feel good or bad just like a normal person. Please, please, please don't be put off by the rash horror stories.

Nobody wanted to sit next to me in the ER, it looked like I had the small pox or chicken pox! It is a shame because I found it to be very effective before this. It's funny, I had read the reviews and thought the rash must just be a freak thing, but I suspect if it happend to me it must happen often. I'm not usually sensitive to allergies. The doctor in the ER said it's good I didn't ignore it because he has seen people end up in life-threatening conditions in ER with this drug.

I am terrified of depression and swear by Cipramil (SSRI) I have only just got myself down to 1 Cipramil a day with the stimulatory anti depressant Edronax replacing the SSRI high doses.

When Lamictal was added to the regimen within a couple of months I felt more level. More even. Able to stop and think.

It has done wonders to stailize my mood. I have had to mix with other drugs - always searching for that 'magic cocktail', but this drug has helped me stay closer in the middle than ever before and has had absolutely no side effects for me whatsoever - I only know I am taking it because my ups and downs are a lot less steep and wavy on a chart and this has been the one constant in all the magic cocktails. Of course, everyone has their own experiences - no two people feel the same from the same drug, but for me, it has changed my quality of life for the better.

Before I started Lamictal, I was depressed (deeply) for three days, and completely fine for 4 days. After I started taking lamictal my illness got quantatively worse (more days with depression a week), but qualitively better (not that deep). My first dose was 200 mg. After a few months I increased to 400 mg. At the end I didnt have more than half a day of normal mood a week. Other side effects were crying spells, sensitivity for sound, and shaky hands and head.

Lamictal doesn't help me with mania or rapid thoughts, and the anti-psychotic drugs like Seroquel and Zyprexa give me migraine headaches and dizziness.

1/2/2005 5:56:22 PM,0.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"A near-fatal reaction I tried Lamictal for about three months in 2003. I had just switched psychiatrists, and my new doctor, noting that I was continually struggling with depression, asked me which of several medications I wanted to try. Based on very limited knowledge of the drug, I selected Lamictal. I did know that about one person in a thousand breaks out in a possibly fatal rash from this drug, but I didn't suppose it would be me. My doctor was very cautious, allowing me to increase my dose twice as slowly as the literature advises. For the first month I felt increasingly productive, then frantically productive. I played piano and composed at the computer (my normal pursuits) for such long hours and at such an intensity that I injured one arm in an overuse injury that has plagued me ever since. Although I slept 8 hours a night I could not sit still during the day. Whenever I felt slight depression I increased my dosage, but never quicker than the doctor had instructed. My pulse was staying at a constant 100 bpm (quite high for me) and I could always feel the strong beat. ""My lamotrigine so energizes my brain that I have to have this intense, creative outlet,"" I wrote in my journal, then referring to my arm injury, ""Not making music for me is like putting a cork in a nuclear reaction."" Finally my body did crash. As I wrote about it in my journal later, ""Pink explosions on my skin, walls of heat in my chest, burning in my skull, when you come to call. Soul aloneness in my brain, I keep singing one refrain. It's a lie I can't refute, when you come to call."" All over my body huge pink hives erupted. At first I thought it was shingles--I had had that before and it was at least as painful. Several doctors could not diagnosis it. At last my psychiatrist pinpointed the cause and immediately took me off Lamictal. I spent 4 or 5 day lying in bed, on heavy painkillers, waiting for the rash to begin to subside. At the end of that time I found my"

I am astonished at how well I am doing. I have no side effects at all this time around because we titrated very slowly after the rash incident. Last weekend I was in a situation that used to make me freak out and stiffen up and glare at people and just gneerally be miserable and twitchy. This time, I was calm and able to stay focused on what i was doing and not feel any discomfort at all. Back in the 90s when Prozac came out and people talked about it changing their lives, I didn't believe them. I never felt that way about Prozac and I thought it was all hype. Now I understand how they felt. My work performance has soared (my supervisor is recommending that I be promoted) and I have a truly normal range of feelings now. I had not realized before this how much my mood disorder had been affecting my life. It tooks months to get settled on it, but it was so incredibly worth the wait. ---- Back in July 2004, I was beginning to think that Celexa was no longer working for me. I'd started a new job a short while before and my stress levels shot way up. I began to wonder if maybe I just couldn't cope with full-time work any more, or if tech support was too stressful for me. In August, I was put on a short course of steroids for my nasal allergies. It worked beautifully for that, but after about a week my mood changed drastically. I was angry all the time and incredibly irritable. I was having to take klonopin at work to keep from yelling at callers, and I came very close to tears almost every day. I started obsessing about driving my car off the road into a ditch, and I hadn't been suicidal for years. I eventually ended up checking myself into the hospital because I was afraid of the intrusive thoughts and suicidal compulsions.

My migraines are pretty bad when they're bad - daily and severe. I end up in the hospital a couple of times a year for them unfortunately. So, it's not just Lamictal that I'm on for Migraines, but it seems to work in combination with my other meds. No apparent side-effects. Interestingly, and I don't remember what journal this was from, but I just saw an abstract online from my own HA Doc that said that Lamictal was not that effective for Migraine prevention.

With that said, I went on Lamictal. This is really odd because, I asked to be put on Lamictal, because I saw on remedyfind.com, where it was rated best for a mood stablizer. While on it I got up to 300 mg. I was on it for about 4 months. For me personally, it may have been the worst acting drug I've taken yet. I have had a lot of experience, too. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, and have been drug resistant. I've been on a total of aprox. 20 different drugs over a five year period. But of course my negative reaction doesn't mean a whole lot, because that is just my individual reaction. I had a lot of side effects, which is the most ironic aspect of it, because I chose to go on it because it was supposed to have the fewest side effects, compared to other options. While on it I experienced Horrible dry mouth, I couldn't even talk more than about 20 seconds on the phone without my mouth being so dry my lips were sticking to my teeth. I just couldn't talk for extended periods of time. I had some skin problems, nothing as serious as the rash they speak off, or enough to discontinue. I got sick from it, if I did any type of strenuous exercise, I'd get very light headed and sick, and would throw up. It happened many times. My mood went into periods of anxiety, severe racing thoughts, changing thoughts, worry, feeling like I was losing my mind. I had a LOT of anger outburst on it.

I seem to feel like it's too good and then get all worried, like it makes me think too much. The Lithium, of course, kept me from thinking too much but the side-effects were downright nauseating (which I couldn't stand). The side-effects of Lamictal have only been slight head-ache sometimes and some diarrhea in the beginning. i'm taking 100mg of Lamictal with 200mg of Zoloft each day. I've been on the 100mg of Lamictal for about a month now, and I was on Lithium for the six months before that.

I have been prescribed lamotrigine to stabilise my mood and hopefully reduce anxiety. I started lamotrigine at 50 mg and the notorious rash appeared within four days of starting it. I asked my psychiatric nurse for advice and we both agreed that it would be best to continue with the treatment as I was feeling well and had no other symptoms. The rash was not irritating, though it spread to over my abdomen and down to my right knee -- that particular rash looked like prickly heat and was raised and pink. I also had a different type of rash along my right elbow and up to my wrist which was flat and looked like dark flecks of blood beneath the skin. The rash lasted for approximately two and a half weeks, and disappeared two days after increasing the dose to 100 mg daily. I do take the antihistamine levocetirizine (Xyzal) for hayfever anyway, but I decided to take chlorpheniramine (Piriton) in addition to that in an attempt to reduce the rash. I'm not sure if it really had any effect, since the rash appeared to fade of its own accord. I understand why the manufacturers and most doctors advise patients to discontinue lamotrigine at the first sign of any rash, however, I think that this may be mainly down to the fact that doctors fear that they will be sued if they do not give this advice. In reality I think that most people who get the rash develop the non-serious form and have nothing to fear. The real danger signs are when you have the rash and start to feel flu-like symptoms. Up until now I have yet to feel any effect from lamotrigine. Actually, only today have I felt a subtle change -- I can't quite describe it and in fact it might not be related to lamotrigine at all, but I'm hopeful that this drug will be useful either as a monotherapy, or at the very least I'm hoping it will form the backbone of my medica"

I started on it quite early in it's implication of efficacy for bipolar (leaning toward a depressive element). The major advantage for me is the ""ease of use"" and the lack of significant side-effects. No lithium or valproate blood levels, among many other side effects of those two. The 400mg seemed to be too much, thus a reduction to 150 bid. This is among a 'cocktail' of 3 others: wellbutrin, seroquel and clonazepam. The research seems to increasingly indicate the antidepressant can cause or worsen rapid cycling (typically SSRI's). So, I am currently doing a gradual titration down on the wellbutrin. Seroquel is at 25-100mg q hs depending on my highs and clonazepam 1 mg q hs. I am so hoping to get down to a low or NO antidepressant. It seems my cycling has decreased since the reduction in both wellbutrin (400) and lamictal(400). I did have cognitive problems which, I think, was related to the higher doses of these 2 ?? I did have one drunken suicide/overdose episode during a bout of some sort of agitated depression. I've been back to work (after 8 mos) for 4 months.

That's unacceptable, so I am stuck with 50mgs. It's not doing much, so I don't think my pdoc will keep me on it after my next visit.

In fact, I think the lamictal is making me more anxious. ***************************************************************** I have just started lamictal and, if may be my imagination, but it seems to have settled my rapid cycling. I seem to be a little hypo still, but am not bouncing around - no sudden crying spells or anger spells. No ugly mania. I'm only on day 6, too! I've never had anything work this fast - so it may all be in my head. :-D I am also on 400mgs zonegran (pdoc says I may need to be on 2 mood stabilizers), 100mgs seroquel (which will be changed to abililfy next), 150mgs wellbutrin (which we hope to stop), & 20mgs geodon 2x daily - which we also hope to stop when the abilify is started. I'vd gained 30 lbs on the seroquel, so I hope I'll be able to lose some of it now that I'm on lamictal - once the seroquel is stopped. So, so far, so good.

So anyway, I immediately stopped taking it, but I have a lot fewer clothes to wear since everything seems so horrifically tight (BTW, the only other drugs that've messed with my weight are Seroquel & Depo Provera - birth control shot). The dr. & her nurse both told me Lamictal does NOT tend to cause weight gain but were both sympathetic to my drama. I have no ill feelings towards Lamictal - everyone reacts differently - in my case, I just could not control my appetite - I felt like I was eating 24/7 - if I wasn't eating I was thinking about eating... The minute I stopped the drug my normal appetite returned, but unfortunately the weight won't melt off as fast as it crept on, even with diet & exercise. So, that's my experience...

I also take depakote, eskalith (450 mg), and trazadone (100-200 mg as a sleep aid) at night, 2 hours before bedtime. With this combination of apparently low therapeutic dosages, I have no side effects and am predominantly symptom free for over 8 months.

Once the Depakote was out of my system and its side effects were completely gone (e.g mental confusion, attention difficulties, language - speaking and writing problems, weight gain, and generally feeling stupid and slow), with Lamictal such side effects were but a distant memory and as such a welcome blessing. Overall, I noticed no significant side effects as I titrated up to a daily dose of 200 mg. Best of all the one greatly dreaded side effect WEIGHT GAIN, so often unavoidable with many bipolar meds, was gone too. I not only lost the weight I had gained on Depakote but I also continued to lose weight on the Lamictal. I did at one point develop a rash, it was probably not related to the Lamictal but one cannot take the chance, so to be safe I had to briefly stop the Lamictal. Unfortunately, I also had to ""cold turkey"" all of my meds at the time and go back on one med at a time which took several weeks; the experience was NOT fun even if the mania at times was. I think Lamictal is great for its low side effect profile. If it works for you I think you will also like the fact that it usually makes people lose weight. So, if you Doc suggets it, I think it worth considering, give it a try. Some may find that it works as a straight antidepressant, more importantly for bipolars its usually good protection for warding off future depression (once the strong vacuum of that black hole that you thought would never release you finally does.) Even at 400 mg I notice little if any side effects. I still have break through depressions but they could be more severe if not for the Lamictal, whose to say?

I consider this an excellent medication; however, you need to know your own body before attempting to take this medication. You also need to be able to talk to your doctor and that he listens to you. A therapeutic dosage for one person is not necessarily a therapeutic dose for another. This drug is also expensive if you don't have insurance and therefore, starting out at a smaller dosage means you can add pills if you need to go up and add at your body’s rate of tolerance. Lamictal can be the answer to those of us that have tried all the other medications and they have not worked. It also does not have the weight gain side effect that some of us can not have. I also have sleep apnea."

After a year or so on lamictal (for depression and possible bipolar disorder for which it was very effective) I spoke to my psychiatrist about loss of memory and inability to think clearly. He recommended testing by a psychologist who administered the WAIS-III and the WMS-III tests for IQ and memory. His finding was a frightening discrepancy between my verbal and performance IQ, consistent with the onset of Alzheimer’s. In real speak, I was still very smart based on tests that challenged my vocabulary and verbal understanding, but I could not perform tasks that required processing of new information or short term memory. So I went on-line and read some of the experiences of people who had taken the drug, terrifying and very different from those listed by the drug companies. That's where I found the term stupid pill. I have cut my dosage in half, from 200mg/day to 100mg/day. The change is so dramatic (apparent to other people as well as myself) that I haven't yet tried to go cold turkey. It seems just as effective for stabilizing my mood at the lower dosage. My Doctor kept pushing me to get to at least 200mg/day because less was not considered to be a ""therapeutic dose,"" though I felt I was seeing good results at 100mg/day. I am writing this because I am really concerned about other people who may have the same experience I did:. that they will not be warned about possible intellectual side effects, and may therefore not notice them, and that they will be encouraged to take more of the drug than absolutely necessary. For me, being stupid and emotionally flattened are not acceptable side effects, but that must be weighed against the severity of your depression or mood swings. Per my experience, it is an effective drug, but the dosage should be kept at the minimum at which one can function. Good"

Was started on Seroquel at the same time as this in hopes of mood stabilization/appetite suppression, along with Wellbutrin. Still on Wellbutrin and have replaced Seroquel with Topamax. Hard to tell with polypharmacy, but overall, especially with respect to side effects, Lamictal far surpasses Depakote and Li.

Although I have not experienced as much relief from the depression as I would have liked, it has definitely taken the edge off. For me 50mg (25mg/BID) is a good dosage. At the 75mg level I became extremely agitated & experienced a worsening of anxiety & insomnia. The enduring sidefx for me have been --disturbance in sleep quality & itching, but no weight gain! I have a really fritzy system & this one is NOT bad. Update: Oct/2003: Still doing well. I have noticed (especially over the last month) that I have experienced a dramatic decrease in my angry/irritable/ragey spells (I have dysphoric mania & mixed states). This is an unexpected surprise as I have never found a helpful Rx in that dept. It has not put a complete stop to my swings, but they do not inflict the same degree of injury. I feel much more calm & consistent through the day, & I no longer feel as ""psychologically disfigured"" as I did before Lamictal. I also wanted to add that all of the above mentioned side-fx have dropped off. I am sleeping fine, am no longer itchy & still have not gained a single #. Yeah! Update: August/2004: Although it worked fairly well for about a year, it has unfortunately punked out on me completely in regard to the antidepressant effects. It simply has not performed over time with the exception of the anger control properties. I now feel as depressed as I did when I first started this Rx."

Well my response to that is I am not back I am reborn. I feel like a totally different person. I have clear concise thoughts, I still struggle like everyone else but for some reason I am able to cope with all that life has thrown my way. My therapist told me the other day that yes the meds are helping but all the work I am putting into life now has made things better than meds alone ever would. Well, my answer to that is the meds have given me a kick in the pants and the energy to work on all the things I have let go in the past. I was numb before on the meds I was taking and it is no wonder to me why i stopped taking meds all together for a few months before I got on the ones I am on now. Lamictal has been god sent to me, it has made me feel so clear, so focused and I finally feel like I can deal with life. I don't feel out of control I am not compelled to wallow in self pity but rather deal with the things that have kept me down for so many years. My only wish now is that all meds could work the same I would then expect every person with bipolar to take the same meds I do especially Lamictal. JULY- A few months ago stress from work caused a huge set back, my dr increased my dose. I am still doing well although the stress gets bad, I dont seem to handle it well but Im not entirely sure a med can really eliminate that entirely. I just feel like sometimes I dont deal with things as well as ""normal"" people and thats frustrating. I still feel this is a great med, and the weight loss since Im on Lamictal is close to 100 lbs.

It started on my stomach and went up to my neck and at first just itched and was like a mild sunburn. My doctor had me go to my regular physician who told me it didn't look severe enough to have to stop. Unfortunately it got worse and a week later one morning I woke up and my whole chest had hives like poison ivy from my belly button to my neck. My face had broken out like I had acne. My doctor told me to go to the emergency room immediately which I did and they admitted me overnight and put me on some type of steroid. I spent the night and a couple days later the rash went away but it was quite a frightening experience as the doctors said it could possibly have caused shock to my system if I hadn't come in.

It worked fairly well in combo with anti depressants and periodic use of antipsychotics. However, when my mother passed away, I had a very severe mood swing and had to be hospitalized. The psychiatrist in the hospital (not my regular doctor) increased my lithium dosage from 1200 mg per day to 1800 mg per day. For several months I was dehydrated constantly. I couldn't get enough liquid into me and was always thirsty. I came down with a viral infection and became more dehydrated which led to lithium toxicity. By the time I got to the hospital, my kidneys had shut down. Within a few days on IV fluids I recovered; however, I have to see a kidney specialist every year and my kidneys now only function at about 80% capacity. I was forced to switch to Lamictal by this incident and I am not sorry about that. Lamictal has worked extremely well - better than Lithium at keeping my moods level. I haven't had a real mood swing since being on Lamictal. It has fewer side effects and my kidney functioning has not decreased. I have been taking it for about 7 years now. And there is no going to the doctor every month for a lithium level check. I highly recommend Lamictal. It is very important in the beginning to watch out for a rash. This can be very serious and life threatening but is also rare. I just would like to add for people who have been recently diagnosed or having trouble with BP that it is a very complex and difficult condition to manage and cope with BUT in my lifetime I have seen DRAMATIC improvements in treatment choices.

It took me about two weeks to recover from that little amount of drug because I was very weak. There was no doubt in my mind that my body could not tolerate this drug. I wanted this drug to work because it is one of the safest drugs to take for bipolar when pregnant. Please be careful if you begin to get bad back pain down your spine. I don't want anyone else to suffer. I know this drug is supposed to have very few side effects, but I am sure there are others out there like me. I wanted this drug to work so badly. Please be careful-horrible & scary experience!!!"

In hospital seroquel (300 mg tid) and lamictal (still titrating) and on release, went back on Synthroid, added Neurontin, where I had a rapid change in mood after a few days on an increased dose, that lasted a week... then a depressed cycle, added Wellbutrin (bupropion) 75 mg a day... more depression added another 75mg a day (75 mg am and pm) Anyway, I stabilized, returned to work, and with some bumps in moods, (I realize I cannot expect to be totally free of the mood swings) though not as severe... I still think of suicide and the futility of life, but hey, finally, after years of suffering, lithium not helping I am on a good path and I can think and read again.

5/10/2004 5:31:59 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"Update: Lamictal Didn't Work For Me I have been on Lamictal for a couple of months now. It seems to be working well for me. I have had no rashes develop as of yet, (thank God). The only side effect I seem to have is that it makes me drowsy. I’ve gone trough a traumatic time in my life recently and the Lamictal and Neurontin I’ve been taking have controlled my mania and depression to the point where I didn’t reach the extremes I normally would without the medication. Because I am Bipolar I, I have been desperately searching for a drug that would control my episodes of mania and depression. After so many different drug combinations Lamictal seems to be working for me. My doctor is slowly increasing the dose of Lamictal. His ultimate goal is for me to reach 200 mg. UPDATE: I no longer take Lamictal. I haven’t now for over a year. Lamictal made my hair fall out by the masses. I thought for sure I was going to go bald. Luckily I didn’t, and my doctor switched me from Lamictal to Zonegran, which is actually working for me a lot better then Lamictal did and as an added bonus doesn’t cause my hair to fall out."

The Depakote barely showed in his blood after a few years. He was in deep depression. We went to a new Dr. that specializes in BP. We tapered down the Depakote, and started the Lamictal starter pack. It seemed forever to get to 400mg. But, the depression lifted very quickly. Things seem to get better and better every month. No depression. The Depakote kept my son's anger in check better than the Lamictal. He still struggles with anxiety also. But, he had panic attacks while taking Depakote too. All in all, this is the best my 19 yr. old son has been in his life. He has been on medication for BP1 since he was 10. I knew something was wrong at age 3, but no one believed children could be born BP. He still takes the 900 of Lithobid with the 400 Lamictal at bedtime."

4/29/2004 3:37:38 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"Lamictal has made my life bearable. I had been on Wellbutrin and Geodon for a while and they just weren't working adequately enough for me. I was having mixed mania and becoming paranoid, self harming and intense suicidal ideation. I ended up overdosing and after my time in the ER I was hospitalized in a local psychiatric hospital. I truly felt like this was it, nothing could help me. But I had asked them if I could try Lamictal..what the hell I had tried about everything else it seems. So I did and it started working so fast. I am also on a boatload of other meds but by far I think the Lamictal has made a huge difference. I am living again instead of just surviving. I pray to god (and I'm not religious) that I will never get any severe side effects from Lamictal because I would have to stop taking it and go through this entire med guinea pig thing again. Some people are frightened by the rare possibility that you can get ""the rash"" which can be very serious if left untreated. But even if it wasn't rare I would still take it because to me the benefit of this medication is well worth the risk. If any of you try this medication I truly hope it does as much for you as it does for me. I am currently on 100mg which is the lowest dose normally, and I am increasing slowly (I only increase 25mg ever two weeks) to avoid side effects. One thing that I do not care for are the ""chewable"" lamictal tablets...they are truly nasty. I swallow them but they are so tiny they sometimes get stuck on your tongue and start dissolving. Even with that, it's still worth it. Thank god for Lamictal."

4/26/2004 2:49:55 AM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"First Seizure in 12 years A few months ago, my doctor recommended I ween off of phenobarbital because of the depression I suffered. He actually wanted to stop medication completely since I hadn't had a seizure in 12 years. A few days ago, I was driving down the interstate and had a seizure. I drove for 10 miles down the wrong side of the interstate before going off the road and flipping my mini-van. The van is totalled, but I walked away with only bruises and no memory of the event. The only side effects I had noticed up to this point were sleep related--being wide awake after only 4 hours of sleep or waking up every couple of hours during the night. Unfortunately, my neurologist would not see me. He simply doubled my dose, so I am now taking 100mg, twice daily. I am very concerned about all of this. I don't know yet whether I will continue with the Lamictal or try something else. At this point, I don't know if the lamictal is ineffective or if the dose is simply too low."
4/21/2004 4:48:23 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Added to my cocktail Lamictal has been very helpful in stabilizing my moods. I had very few, if any, noticeable side effects with a slow upward titration. This was an add-on to the Wellbutrin I have used for several years. I use Lamictal 400mg, Wellbutrin 400mg, and MD approved ""adjustable"" doses of Klonopin 0.5-2mg, and PRN low dose Seroquel, 25-100mg. I have found this cocktail to be the most effective drug therapy to treat my Bipolar symptoms. It sounds like a lot of medication, but I feel as ""normal"" and relatively stable as ever. I work 32 hours a week (in a fast-paced career) and function fairly well. As discussed with my MD, I am hoping to slowly decrease (perhaps come off) the Wellbutrin if the Lamictal helps enough with my patterns of depression. Here's the rationale for my mix: Lamictal seems to show having anti-depressant properties. Wellbutrin, my main antidepressant. Klonopin also has mood-stabilizing properties, and helps with the accompanied anxiety I experience. The seroquel 25-50mg helps me sleep (another big issue of the past) BUT ALSO helps bring me down a notch when I'm heading up. I swear it also helps flatten me out when I begin cycling. I adjust the dosage of one or both up a tad or down to my typical doses. Klonopin 1.0 and Seroquel 50 at night is my usual pattern with the main meds of Wellbutrin 200 bid with my Lamictal 200 bid. I did a lot of research to find this combo and still with minimal sexual side-effects. Still this is a difficult condition and life remains to be a challenge every day. Good luck and keep trying to move forward."

4/10/2004 4:06:27 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Lamotrigine/carbemazepine reaction I am 27, female and have had epilepsy for about 10 years. I was on Carbemazepine, which did not provide full control, and I thought what I wanted was full control. So they tried adding Lamictal. Unfortunately the combination gave me some interesting side effects. I was really bad-tempered while on it - but I think this is quite common during the first few months? I have never had food poisoning, but I thought I had it. (I know this sick feeling now, but it is quite alarming). I did not get the effect all the time, they started me on very low doses of Lamictal to avoid it. However nobody ever told me that alcohol and AED's don't mix. With the benefit of hindsight, I wonder if it was truly the two drugs disagreeing with me, or because of alcohol. What I remember happening was about 3 days after a single drink, I would get dizzy, get diarrhoea and severe vomiting. I could not sit up straight and was most comfortable (least dizzy and nauseous) laying twisted over the side of the bed. The higher my head the worse it was. This would last for several days at a time. Due to these effects my doctors took me off the drug, although I think it was working quite well. Unfortunately I did not suspect the alcohol till I had the same effect on a different combination of drugs. So I don't know for sure what caused this effect. I can't be sure it never happened without alcohol. PS - part of the effect before you feel really ill can almost be described as being heavily intoxicated without having drunk anything. The things I have found to help the most with this type of effect are always to eat before taking pills, and laying down to sleep through it when it happens. Fresh air is also a relief."

Finally, as I got older, I realized the importance of taking medication. That is, I felt my highs were getting out of control and my lows were bringing me to such despair that I gave in and decided to try medication. When I first took Lamictal, I had some side effects...not sleeping well, not hungry, but something fabulous was happening. One day shortly after starting the medication, I felt a warm blanket in my brain.

I finally felt like everyone else...I could see why no one could relate to me... Since I can remember, I was bipolar, yet I never wanted medicine.

I stopped taking Lamictal in November 8 2003 due to severe panic/anxiety attacks I was experiencing. The attacks had become so extreme that I nearly quit my job--not once, but on several occasions--because I couldn't handle the stress. I didn't make the connection with Lamictal until I sat down and thought about when I first started getting the attacks (right after I started taking Lamictal last year). It started with nocturnal panic attacks several days a week and turned into long, drawn-out anxiety. Now that I've been Lamictal-free for over two months, I haven't had any problems. It's a pity because the medication had been working quite well for me. *August 16, 2003* I started out on a low dose of Lamictal in January 2002-Bipolar I. My pdoc gradually increased it to around 100 mg twice a day. I started taking it after I had been hospitalized twice within one month and I was, it seemed, runnning out of options. I've had ECT at least thirty times, and I didn't want to ""go there"" again. I can't tolerate most anti-depressants--one AD sent me into a full-blown psychotic episode. My pdoc told me I either try the Lamictal or I was going to be inpatient again. I am, by the way, his first patient to give it a try. I suppose most people are afraid of the ""fatal rash."" After about three months (a record for me, as I am one of those med non-compliant types) it was working well. Sadly, a good friend of mine, also bipolar, committed suicide. Due to the terrible grief and stress, I ended up in the hospital, again, and my pdoc upped the dose to 175 mg twice a day, which made a huge difference. I've been on Lamictal, at 325 mg a day, for over four months. It may not sound long, but I've tried lithium, depakote, neurontin... I have been doing really well (no extremes between my depression and mania) and I don't feel that this is one of those meds t"

I was switched to 150mg/day of Lamictal, and at my request my Dr. lowered it to 25 mg. in the morning and 50 mg. at night. This lower dose worked just fine at controlling mood (along with Seroquel and Klonipin). I was able to reduce the dosage of Wellbutrin to control depression. I went from 300 mg./day to only 100 mg./day. I believe that the Lamictal treats both depression and manic episodes.

I found it to be extremely helpful and finally had hope again. I have had trials of many other meds which were not sucessful. I remained stable on 300 mg of lamictal for 6 months till i met my insurance limit on meds. Lamictal was so expensive that i could not afford to stay on it and slowly got off it. I went down hill fast and was back to where i started. Now that my insurance has realized that it is more cost effective to pay for the lamictal than inpatient hospital stays i am slowly increasing the dose again. This time around i have had mild rashes with dose increases which last for a week or so. They are very itchy but are not the dreaded rash so many talk about. I would stop taking lamictal if i had any fever or other symptoms but my doc. and i agree the benefits out weigh the risks, and as long as i immediatly report any other symptoms it is ok to keep trying. Again i am feeling hope as my depression goes down and my ability to function goes back up."

I had been stablized on Zyprexa, but still had symptoms of depression. I really wasn't expecting much from it, and saw no benefits until the dosage was increased to 200 mg (after many months of slow increases). It did the trick though. I've been at that dose for a year now, with a recent increase due to a month of rapid cycling. Although I'm still on the Zyprexa, I consider Lamictal to be my main mood stablizer. I had no side effects from it except when it was increased to 250 mg. Then I had one day of dizziness, nausea, and brain fog. I was actually surprised that Lamictal had such antidepressant effects. 8/03; Lamictal has been shown to be my main mood stabilizer after I missed one dose and started to cycle. It was raised to 300mg and now I take it in divided doses to help keep my blood level more constant. I also take Zyprexa but am hoping to discontinue it soon because of the weight gain. For me, Lamictal has been side-effect free. 2/04 After having a 3 month episode, it was found out that the Lamictal and Zyprexa worked hand-in-hand with each other. Both were increased and now I've remained stable for 7 weeks. My Zyprexa is at 15mg (a high dose) and my Lamical is at 350mg. Will probably be lowering the Zyprexa if I remain stable. The Lamictal will probably stay the same."

You should know that for other drugs (Trileptal, Tegretol) the chance that you 'll get stevens-johnson is 1 in 200,000 while for Lamictal it is 1 in 1000. Also don't buy that there is only 10% chance that you will have a rash because if you just look for example the rates here more than 30 of 100 involve skin rashes. I believe it is a very dangerous drug, it shouldn't have been on the market and if you are willing to take that risk just make sure that your symptoms are quite severe or you are very desperate."

Even though I showed them I was on Lamictal, they missed the Stevens-Johnson angle of possible fatal rash (sometimes in mouth). I caught it in time thanks to my psychiatrist, but I wouldn't have seen much use in continuing Lamictal anyways. A slight improvement and stabilization in mood (I've bipolar-II w/ atypical depr.) at the start didn't outweigh the cost and fact that I still would seriously (suicidally) destabilize on trips across a couple of time zones."

At about the 3 to 4 week mark I began having difficulty sleeping. I'd get numb fingers and hands, itch like crazy and feel my heart throbbing and pounding as if I was really anxious (but without the anxiety). After 3 or 4 nights in a row getting as little as 3 hours sleep I started getting extremely uptight so as soon as I saw some new spots on my arm (I'd been warned to stop taking it if ther was any sign of a rash) that was enough for me. Judging by some of the other reviews on this page (see ""SCARY STUFF"" 2/26/2003), I think I did the right thing.

11/23/2003 11:10:56 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Wow August/2003 - I have had a nasty sleep disorder [irritability, itching, constantly waking up] for years. The only thing that helped was Valium but not for long. Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and put on Lamictal. It is supposed to help depression and it certainly has [no depression in over two months instead of up and down all day]. But it has also eliminated my night anxiety and sleeplessness. Lamictal is not supposed to work on the manic phase but I haven't had one of those, either, in two months. I sure hope this continues to work. It's a new world. November, 2003 - I have now been on Lamictal for about five months. It is still working against depression [much milder and more controllable with cognitive strategies] except that soon after I wrote the first part of this review, I started experiencing the same old cycles of irritability and sleeplessness. These happen a couple of times a month and can last as long as eight days. My shrink gave me oxazapam to be used, sparingly, but I find I can usually get by on antihistamines or gravol. Anyway, the cycles of irritability are getting worse so I am going to go to a new shrink to see if I should take more lamictal - I am only on 50 mg - or whatever. The problem is that when I am not irritable [manic? but it's no fun - I've had fun manic cycles and this ain't it], I can't really remember how bad it gets. Therefore, I don't tell the shrink what he needs to know to get serious. I think that's at least part of the problem, anyway. In the Canadian system, right now, there are too few psychiatrists so it may take several months to get an appointment with a new shrink. I'll survive, [I get rageful and suicidal but don't seem to do anything about it] but now that Ive had the experience of no cycles I WANT THAT BACK!!"

I was dying until I went into the ER and they admitted me immediately. I hear alot of good things about this drug and I am glad that it appears to be helping so many. But watch yourself on it, especially if you may be prone to allergies. I stopped taking the drug at the first sign of allergy and still continued to get worse and worse. Now I am trying to put the pieces back together after such a very scary experience. Best to you all and I hope no one ever has to go through what I went through but was lucky enough to survive. Update: After having several lab tests done on me in the hospital, I am now looking at a possible diagnosis of lupus and another connective tissue disease. It doesn't appear that the drug caused my auto-immune problems, but it would appear that my reaction to this med. incited the pre-existing condition in me. Also, doing research on this, I found info from the FDA that in rare cases, this drug can cause lupus-like symptoms. I just add this info for anyone else that may ever go through such an experience. It was terrifying and I found it very difficult to find answers. I am glad to see that so many people have a good response to this drug. I am not trying to trash it.

8/7/2003 2:41:53 AM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Bad Experience My doc prescribed Lamictal as well as Seroquel and Xanax to treat my bipolar disorder as well as anxiety, and I was very displeased with the Lamictal. It seemed like I was sleepy all the time, either taking a nap or trying to take a nap, and I was always ill to those around me. It definitely made me more manic, and it was hard for me to make rational decisions. I even managed to crash my car while on this medication because of my poor judgment and due to my being very impatient at the time. I think if I had been calmer maybe I wouldn't have had the accident. I am glad to be off that medication and now on a new one that I will hopefully have better luck with."

At first, I was very tired and my sex drive just crashed to nothing. Now, I am adjusting, and only when my dosage of Lamictal is increased (every week for 5 weeks) will I suffer any side-effects. They usually go away after 4 days. I also started with Lexapro in the morning and Lamictal at night and I seem to be doing much better. The Lexapro was making me very euphoric, but the Lamictal is now helping to level me out. Although I am only half-way to my eventual full dosage, I am already feeling better. Depression, mood swings, and irritability are there, but much more manageable. I don't feel like doing nothing, and I have been getting out of the house for the first time in years. This is truly a wonderful treatment for someone with bipolar... but you have to give it a chance. I was getting impatient with the side-effects, but these boards helped me stick it out.

So why take three or four meds when only one works for the whole! But you have to introduce it slowly to avoid side effects (the first month I had dose-dependent itchy-skin, but it blended away then). P.S.: Sometimes (during hospitalization and soon after) I have to take it with Aurorix and/or Seroquel, the best combo for me."

My particular condition has been resistant to just about every treatment so far -- Lamictal was, however, the most effective of any drug yet. And the side effects were simply non-existent. This may not be true for smaller, younger, or females, but overall Lamictal is certainly a step in the right direction from Tegretol and Depakote."

6/13/2003 7:19:42 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"Wasn't sure it was helping I started taking Lamictal about 8 months ago and really wasn't sure if it was doing anything. It's so hard to tell if the meds are helping or if I'm just having a good week; if it's a full moon or the sun is finally shining. Recently, in a desperate attempt to get me out of a severely depressed/suicidal state, my psychiatrist and I decided to revisit Topamax, which I had taken at one point and had to discontinue because of side effects. The Topamax put me into an extremely irritable and agitated manic state. It was then that I realized how long it had been since I had had that severely irritated, agitated, want-to-jump-out-of-my-skin feeling. I guess the Lamictal had been working, it had been months since I had acted like that...screaming and snapping at my family and being frustrated with everything. I also had the most amazing experience. All of my life I just thought my moods were just a result of the way I am. Intellectually, I know that I don't cause my manicky moods, it is the illness, but it is much harder to really, honestly believe it. One night, while on the Topamax, out of nowhere I felt like a switch was flipped and I suddenly got agitated and flew into a rage. Because it had been months since I had acted this way, I was able to really recognize that this behavior is not ""me"", it is the disease. I could, for the first time, clearly see the separation of ""me"" and the ""monster"". It was an awful two weeks on the Topamax but at least I was able to see that the Lamictal was really working. And, even though the Topamax caused me to become manic, it did pull me out of that terrible depression."

I suffer from extreme depression and anxiety. The Lamictal seems to be working for both. So far (one and a half months) I am encouraged. I also have been taking 100mgs of Parnate (mao inhibitor) a day for the last 6 months. I have not responded to any of the traditional antidpressants and that is why my dr. switched me to Parnate. It didn't seem like parnate was working enough on its own, so I was put on the Lamictal to help augment the Parnate. Like I said I am doing much better, and in fact feel almost normal. The only side affect I feel from the Lamictal is I have no energy at all. I'm hoping this feeling goes away on its own. If not, I will try to lower the dose and see if that helps, but I don't want to, as I'm feeling great, except for the grogginess. For resistant depresson, I suggest people ask their dr about an MAOI. There is a diet you have to stay on but if it works, its worth it! I like the addition of Lamictal. It's working both for depression and anxiety, I would highly recommend a person with these problems to give it a try!"

This one caused extreme irritability almost immediately, which I could not deal with, especially as I have two small children and can't put them through my medication induced anger. As soon as I stopped the Lamictal, my mood went back to its normal state, that is, depressed and anxious, but in a way I could deal with. Well, every failure puts me that much closer to the time when I succeed, right?"

Could't eat, sleep, bathe, shave, drive, work, or function. I tried EVERY anti-depressant and anti-seizure drug on the market. Nothing worked, and then one day I discovered Lamictal. THANK YOU LAMICTAL"

I started taking Lamictal about a year ago and have not noticed any side effects...seems to be very effective at preventing depressions. Not so effective on the manic side of things though. But, I take geodon to control that."

Doctors tried about 10 different antidepressants - super manic! Even on high doses of mood stablizers. So Lamictal was my last hope (or ECT). It took about 6 weeks to build it up in my system but I am finally not depressed! And I lost the weight the mood stablizers put on (they now have me on Topamax!. I owe my life to Lamictal! Oh there are two side effects: 1- I itch: Aveeno takes care of that. 2- Anxiety still working on that!"

8/24/2002 10:21:54 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Lamictal Lamictal has been nothing short of a miracle for my treatment-resistant Bipolar Depression. My dosage was very slowly titrated up because I'm also on Depakote, which was very frustrating for me. I was tired of waiting to see if an anti-depressant would be effective (I didn't respond to SSRI's or TCA's), but I understand about the life threating side effects (ie-Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome)."

I am experiencing side effects of vision problems-developed cataracts and have blurry vision even after surgery, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, depression,menstruation stopped, arthritis with pain and swelling, weakness, poor concentration, forgetting words,diarrhea then constipation. My doctor does not seem to think any of this is severe enough to change my medication. It bothers me however. There is no problem with sexual function as there is with many other meds. For some this is salvation for others it is not."

I also have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and anxiety. I have regained my life and I didn't start to feel that way until after I started the lamictal."
6/21/2002 2:11:37 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Depression Report ,"Lamictal side effects After trying several med's for refractory depression, I tried Lamictal. I quickly developed a rash around my facial hairline and my neck - it resembled acne. After a couple of weeks I developed flu-like symptoms: fever, aches, nausea...plus ulcers in my mouth. Next came a full-body rash that itched and burned like crazy. My doctor immediately discontinued the medication, but I still have scars from the rash on my face, neck and arms. Was not on it long enough to judge efficacy for depression."

There has been no sexual side effects, no weight gain and only minor headaches infrequently. There is one issue that persists and that is a slight increase in anxiety and difficulty in sleeping. I take ativan, as needed, to counter these effects. I am pretty happy with the results."

Always had good response initially but they would poop out after a few weeks or months. Since I've been on Lamictal my response hasn't been the high I got from antidepressants. Just an okay kind of feeling. No ups or downs. Just normal, I guess. My shrink says welcome to my world. I guess he means the same as everyone else."
4/28/2002 2:11:38 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"Lamictal works well for me. I take 600mg of lamictal daily as a mood stabilizer. At first it was tried because it has an antidepressant quality to it. I needed a good antidepressant and the anti's on the market were not helping me and were probably making me worse. Anitdepressants never worked for long and had a tendency to bring on hypomania's. Lamictal stabilized my depression tremendously. I don't use an antidepressant anymore. Lamcital controls the depression. <p> If I had to completely start my drug therapy over for some reason, I would choose Lamictal. Unfortunately, it is really expensive."
