1/10/2019 2:39:27 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Trigeminal Neuralgia Report ,"I have taken Tegretol in it various forms for over 10 years. About 5 years ago i started to complement gabapentin to control the TN pain. The dosing through the years has varied, at times, to address the degrees of pain I experienced. Two years ago, i was under a tremendous amount of stress after my mom's first stroke. I must have been taking 3 times the maximum dose for tegretol (3600mg) and at or more than 4800mg of the gabapentin per day for 3 weeks. Needless to say by the end of the third week I had experienced an atrioventricular heart block and needed to be medivaced to a hospital and 5 days later now have a pacemaker. At the time, i honestly did not know that i was ""over dosing"" on the medications, I wanted to simply control the TN pain. I do not know conclusively that the medications caused the block and ultimate heart failure, but it is something to be aware of. I am thankful I wasn't alone that night when this occurred. I simply would have went to sleep and would not be posting this now. The epitol works wonders for the pain...and I have been very aware since my experience dosing and thresholds of pain tolerance."
12/24/2018 8:53:02 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Took carbamazepine for 11 years for seizures. I was on extended release 200 mg morning and at night, and had seizures when highly stressed. It was increased over the years and never stopped seizures. When I had a grand mal seizure with a one hour unconsciousness, and in ER, then referred to a new doctor. Increasing the meds never stopped seizures and a brain lesion on MRI was discovered and removed to stop seizures. The meds gave me side effects of decreased memory, balance problems and lethargic. My speech became slurred too and could not recall needed words for conversation. It has caused my tongue Dystonia, where I have no control and constantly licking my lips, embarrassing. I no longer take this medication and no longer side effects except for Dystonia."

8/27/2018 3:55:00 PM,4 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,It worked perfectly for helping me. The only issues were it made me incredibly tired and slightly nauseous all the time. My dose was lowered to fix the tiredness but it didn't help my condition at all. I'm currently on the search for a new medication but would definitely return to tegretol/carbamazepine again.
9/3/2017 11:57:02 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,Been on this for 3 months and it has made a huge positive difference. I was scared about the side effects but I had to weigh up the pros and cons and took it it has helped me lots. First few weeks had minor side effects but it has gone now.

Before I was ten years old I was extremely fit, lively etc. They struggled to find a cocktail of drugs that could treat my tics without making me a fatass zombie. After two years of guinea pig methods docs found that risperidone, prozac and tegretol worked ""OK"" which is really all you can hope for without self medicating when it comes to Tourette. I had pretty bad tics as a teen but over the course of young adulthood I slept easily half my natural lifespan away yet was terrified of quitting any of those pills. I didn't take them because I was crazy or depressed. I took em for uses for which they're usually not prescribed. Over the last five years with or without my doc's grudging permission I've quit prozac and in the last year I finally quit the last full tablet of risperidone and I experienced immediate and rather stunning weight loss...Like when I quit prozac, and like when I'd reduced risperidone, but almost at a frightening rate. But here's the thing...It's been at least five months since I stopped risperidone and because I'm still taking the tegretol I truly believe it is bl"

I think it was around $50 for three months when I worked... THEN it shot up to $200 A MONTH! ($800 for 3 mos!) Get to know your pharmacist. My pharmacist researched it, told me that Novartis owns the Tegretol RX lab... He then showed me a print out that the generic Tegretol also comes from the Novartis lab....that lab makes both the generic and the brand-name... Once I show that is my doctor he prescribed the generic and I I have noticed no difference.. i.e. No seizures or side effects. I asked the pharmacist why they would sell it for that much and he said so they can make money. You have to do your research. I now pay $12.00 for 3 months.. Saving $785...or $2400 a year.

12/26/2011 10:05:05 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Partial Seizures Report ,"Have had Hx since childhood of partial seizures extending at times to grand mal seizures. The Phenobarbital stopped the grand mal seizures totally & have never had another one in over 30 yrs. Had a high stress job & was working way too many hrs - overtime, swing-back shifts and became very fatigued and run-down. Then the partials started back in again & the Tegretol seems to have stopped them. Have been taking Tegretol XR 600 mg/day but the XR is expensive. My neurologist has agreed to reg. Tegretol 800 mg/.day (which costs only $4/mo). Feel bit more tired with Tegretol though - only drawback."
5/16/2011 1:14:59 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"I was on Tegretol for only one month. Before that I had Abilify (which makes me gain 26 lbs). While in Tegretol 100mg , I have no episodes of mania nor hypomania. Instead I tend to shift towards depression. I have no changes in my weight, but my sleep pattern was hugely affected. I repeatedly woken up during the night, sometimes 4 or 5 times. I can't sleep continuously for more than 2 hrs, and the quality was very poor. During the day, I was very tired, drowsy, confused and cannot think. I constantly thought that this life was not worth living. My doctor quickly stop the Tegretol, unfortunately after that, my mood swings came back. Now I am in Lamictal. Finger cross, this will be better for me."

As for side affects; only during the second and third week of treatment; dizzy spells, confusion, lethargy. That all went away completely. I have to have blood tests every 6 months, otherwise, great."

With a few years of trial and error of dosage, I have now taken the same dosage for 15 yrs. 200mg, 3x daily. I have not had a seizure in 3 yrs. Aside from being very careful at drug interactions and no grapefruit anything (works cuz I hate it anyway), avoid sun without sunscreen (no problem, I am fair skinned and burn easily) and yearly blood checkups on liver functionality and other lvls, I have had no problems. Just gotta pay attention to what works with your particular condition and adjust your life and dosage accordingly."

However after two years of trying many meds and No luck calming or decreasing my three times a week+ seziures he decided for my life it was better to try. I did and seziure activity has decreased to once a month. I have had two children well on this medication one was perterm with nothing wrong. and the other has speach difficulties. They were both healthy but small birth weights. Medication was decreased during pregnancy. However I am not allowed anymore children due to my life almost being lost during my pregnacy of my second.

My thoughts appear to be clear. I have no thoughts of suicide. I DO, however feel a litte unsteady on my feet. I hope this will pass. I had been on Lithium for five years along with Lexapro. Too many side effects from Lithium. That is why the DR switched me to Tegretol. I sure hpoe it works."
5/13/2007 2:00:55 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar I disorder Report ,"I've been taking Tegretol ER for over 2 years now for bipolar I, after having no success with Lithium (too toxic) or Depakote (the zombie-making weight-gain pill!). I think Tegretol is great. I've had no breakthrough mania while taking it. Also, Tegretol has brought excellent stability to my moods with very few side effects. At first I had headaches and was pretty sleepy, but that has gone away completely. I gave it 9s, not 10s, only because Tegretol is not sufficient to stabilize my mood 100%. We had to add a very low dose of Geodon to round it out. Also, it doesn't seem to have any anti-depressant properties, so I also need to take a medium-sized dose of Lexapro. All-in-all, I think Tegretol does an excellent job, making me feel solid and even without dulling me out or making me tired. Even at a very high dose, I don't have that heavily medicated feeling."
12/8/2006 11:22:07 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Multiple sclerosis - Primary progessive (PPMS) Report ,"It served it''s purpose but made me too tired. All the time I was taking this drug I had no idea how relaxed and layed back I had become. I wan't willing to do anything that took any effort what so ever. Not that I could a lot of the time but there were times I could have got back on my feet if I were not half sleeping all the time. It did stop most neurological pain, most of the time. It was never 100% but what is? I would never start this again, I would prefer the pain. After quitting within a week or so I started getting back the fight I use to have in me. I am a lot better off now for stopping the use of it. It just seem to make me into a sombie. That doesn't mean it would for anyone or everyone else, as we can all see all the drugs work great on some and not at all on others. I would recommend trying it, but also watch for symptoms of sleepiness, lazy, careless, and so on. If you begin to lose your desire to fight on, quit the pills. Dealing with MS one needs all the fight they can get, not a drug that knocks the fight out of you."

After birth i decided i wanted to change my meds due to these effects however after several trials i have decided Carbamazipine is better suited to me.

I had broken sleep, an increase in depressive/suicidal thoughts, and an increase in repeating thoughts (really annoying, I would read things over and over and repeat things in my mind that people said or I heard over and over).

At first I was prescribed 1200 mg a day and at 2 different dates a few months a part I had double vision. Upon consultation with my neurologist she referred me to an opthalmalogist. Based on the results of the examination my neurologist decided to decrease my dosage to 1000 mg a day but still take the other medicines I was talking. I had an experience wherein in the entirety of experiencing around 12 seizures while asleep without walking up for the entirety of one year.My wife informed me of the event when I wake up in the morning concerned where I feel some fatigue. I later transferred to another neurologist who placed me into Tegretol but at a lower level (first at 800 mg a day and later at 400 mg) together with Keppra and where I experience the virtually the same number of seizures (partial) though they all transpired daytime for one year and one grand mal.

10/13/2006 12:46:22 AM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,Epilepsy Medications Tegretol works great for me. Right Tempral Lobe damaged during birth. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 32 years old and suffered from petite mal seizures for as long as I remember. Then my husband saw me having a grand mal seizure in my sleep! That explained why I would wake up with bruises. Generic Tegretol does NOT work for me. The fillers use up the active ingredient at a faster rate than the brand name thus putting me under medicated. I was taking the maximum dosage at that time. Now using brand name Tegretol I was able to cut my morning dose by half but still continue to take 600 mg at night because I figure if I get grand mal seizures in my sleep I might as well not cut that dose. It's worked great for the last 27 years. I'm 59 years old at present.

For the first year I was on a ""starter dose"" - 100mg three times a day. The partial sezures were reduced somewhat. The dosage was increased to 200mg 3X/day to try to eliminate those, which helped further. I did have another grand mal about two years later, so the thought was that another medication would be more beneficial rather than increase the dose. As far as side effects, I was initially very drowsy for the first month or so, even at such a low dose - but this diinshed as I became accustomed to the Tegretol. I did gain weight (water retention, which was new to me as a man) and that did not change throughtout my usage. My neurologist was very frank with me - they really don't know how most of these medications work, so trial and error is a part of the treatment process. This has helped me keep perspective and be observant of changes."
8/7/2006 7:56:06 AM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Bipolar II disorder Report ,"A low down dirty shame ... that I'm allergic. After three years of depressive mixed states, I thought I'd finally found THE MED in Tegretol. It was amazing. It was pretty much good for virtually every aspect of my mental state, including motivation, drive, confidence. Most importantly I could finally feel genuine emotions: happiness, sadness, etc. The tegretol basically stopped the constant feelings of being overwhelmed, aggitated and/or beat down. But as I raised the dose I noticed itching and irriation of my ears, nose, throat, eyelids and even my urethra. (Sorry for TMI.) As if this wasn't evidence enough of an allergic reaction, my liver enzymes got way elevated. So my pdoc is having me discontinue. I'm down to 200 mg now and I already feel the scary darkness creeping back in. It's such a shame to have gotten just a taste of what feeling okay might be like before getting yanked back onto the med-go-round again. From what I understand, allergic reactions are pretty uncommon and can almost always be caught with careful monitoring. I think this drug should be prescribed more commonly for BP, but maybe pdocs don't like the extra effort involved with the bloodwork."

My son became manic on long term Lexapro, an SSRI, for his OCD behaviors, and Trileptal seemed to have worked to control that from June to Dec of 2005. Winters are very hard for my 6 year old and he gets completely out of control with OCD and the higher the SSRI, the more manic he becomes in addition to being OCD. We switched to Tegretal which is the more muscular cousin of Trileptal, and not only saw no changes, but also he became ravenous, and gained weight. The doc told us to up the dose, but that did nothing. What worked was getting into late spring and also switching to Abilify. I have to wait until next winter to see what Abilify will do for us then."

The hormone treatment finishes in a month so i guess I'll find out then! When I first started the treament the side effects were pretty bad. My pdoc wanted me on 800mg but when i got up to that i felt so dizzy and generally awful that i went back down to 600mg and stayed there.

1/16/2006 11:24:15 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"This is the one that works for me Gran Mal epilepsy popped into my life in 1978 while in college. First med I was put on was Dilantin. Side effects, such as short-term memory loss, were problematic, especially for a graduate student, so I switched to Tegretol in 1982. Once on the proper therapeutic dose, I have been essentially seizure free. There was one break-through in 1988 when I was ill and on other meds that compromised the Tegretol. I shifted to the extended release formula which made it more convenient. The main negative with Tegretol XR is that it causes abnormal liver enzyme levels. For a period in 2003, Tegretol XR was in short supply and it became difficult to get a supply of the pills without frequent trips to the pharmacy. Because of my excellent seizure history, we (my neurologist and I) thought it might be a good opportunity to try one of the new epilepsy drugs; one that promised equal seizure control without the same load beign placed on the liver. Trileptal was in the same family as Tegretol, but promised to be a kinder, gentler drug on the liver. I made the switch to Trileptal without incident, and on my next blood text my liver enzyme levels were normal. Over the next months, however, I began to experience side effects and then there was a gran mal seizure. The first one in 16 years! After doing tests to make sure there was nothing else going, my doctor and I decided that Trileptal was the wrong drug; I switched back to the Tegretol XR. This is the one that works for me. Curiously, it is now in plentiful supply Drug: TegretolXR Dose: 600 mg (3 x 200mg) taken BID - with breakfast and dinner."

Apparently, in a very small number of patients using this drug, a side effect occurs that causes problems with ""word retrieval"". If you've ever experienced a word ""being on the tip of your tongue"", imagine being like that more or less all the time. And the word that might be on the tip of your tongue could be something like ""phone"" or ""dinner plate"". It's a very weird feeling. Especially for someone like myself who does a great deal of writing at work, this side effect is enough to cause imediate discontinuation of the drug.

10/26/2005 4:49:58 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"How is your libido?? This drug is very cheap, but outdated compared to new drugs (Keppra, Lamictal). I was on Tegretol for 20 years (low dose: 200mg twice a day) and never had another generalised seizure in all that time. However, it did not stop my partial seizures, so I had Frisium (Clobazam) for those. Both drugs had long-term side-effects but I didn't see the connection until I came off them. I have had problems for the last five years or more with eczema on my hands and hairline, and it disappeared when I stopped the Clobazam six months ago. I then started Lamictal and reduced the Tegretol. When I got the Tegretol down to 200mg/day, I was staggered to rediscover my sex-drive overnight. I had gradually lost all interest in sex ten or more years ago and had no idea that it was Tegretol that had 'switched me off'. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? The risk is that it is too embarrassing to talk about, but don't we have a responsibility to warn each other about even the side-effects we consider unmentionable? Even the medical profession is too embarrassed (or ignorant) to tell us about it, so maybe we should ask more probing questions and certainly report all side-effects we discover.

And after going through the real rough ones, such as Lamictal was with me, I can take anything and not be in despair. God has blessed me and made me strong not to ever vomit from anything, He knows I will flip out. I got an abnormal gait. Slurred a few words in the beginning. Memory wasn't fabulous. But in this situation, I was on Phenobarbital, and that drug fries memory from the moment the single pill goes down your throat. I had a bit of weight loss I do believe from this drug from feeling sick to my stomach, so I did not eat very much. Otherwise, I wasn't on it long enough to ensure what it will be like in the long run.

It also upset my stomach. I switched to Lamictal and have been on it for a year. It is a bit of an upper so I feel great.

I am 62, so feeling ten years older than I really am is not good. Regardless, the mood stabilization is worth it. I like staying employed, married, and generally liked. I was surprised that Tegretol is now touted to prevent migraines, when it had never been my experience (as far back as 1984) that mood stabilizers relieve headaches more than causing them. Sure enough, a few months on carbamazepine, and I was *getting* migraines from it. I tried cutting the pills into quarters (50mg) and still got migraines. I tried bits of the pill along with bits of depakote to avoid the migraine each gives and hoping the two together would benefit me (particularly in conjunction with the very small amounts I take of Zyprexa and Thorazine). I *still* got migraines. Nevertheless I am currently using the related oxcarbazepine, which does have less side effects. But Trileptal seems to be starting to give me migraines, too."

Trileptal does not make me feel as stiff, sore, and old as Tegretol, and if I split my 150 mg pill in half it prevents migraines more than causing them.

This mechanism is different to Tegretol XR, which releases the medication steadily over time. The majority of side-effects from the drug tend to ease after only a few days and is probably the only Major Epilepsy medication with this property. Depakote, Dilantin, and Phenobarb., each have a large variety of side effects that never seem to go away during treatment.

I lost all of that within 3 months of starting Tegretol. I was initially very lethargic and tired, so we kept the dose down to around 300-400 mg, and when I would get used to the dose, we would go up 100 mg. The maximum tolerable dose for me is around 600 mg. We tried once to go up to 800 mg, but I was a zombie. For me, this has been the best drug for depression and hypomania without having to add another mood stabilizer. Once in a great while we add some Celexa for occasional breakthrough depression, but I come off it as soon as the depression lifts. I found a couple of years ago that, for me, it is not best to keep a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant going simultaneously, as I dip up and down terribly. I am a rapid cycler. You must watch the blood work on this one, and be sure to tell any health care provider treating you that you are on this, how much, etc. There are some serious drug interactions if one is not careful. My ALT (liver enzyme) stays slightly elevated, but not dangerously so in the opinion of my primary doctor and psychiatrist. I do take Xanax for panic attacks on a regular basis. I find Tegretol a little sedating, but I think I am so accustomed to taking the drug that I seldom notice that anymore. I would like to try Trileptal because of the lack of required labs, etc, but I am reluctant because some have had less than desirable results. I would not want to mess up what I have now, but I still don't feel this is as good as it gets; however, in retrospect, it may be for the time being with the advances in medicine where they stand.

And normally I am a shy person, but Tegretol really did it for me for the social scene. But while I say dumb things from time to time and I worry much less on the stuff, I realized that I wasn't really living my life. One day I would have to face my fears and worries old school style.

Unfortunatly, I'm one of the 6 in a million who developed agranulocytosis, so I had to stop. The only other side effect I had was a mild headache, which is common. Agranulocytosis isnt."

After long-term use patterns of seizures change with the women's body and the tegretol is not effective especially with night-time seizures and the type triggered by the monthly cycle. Also have doubts about the safeness of this medication during pregnancy. My daughter was born with a severe bowel deformity. Also I feel this medication causes a fogginess which hinders concentration and memory.

I found Tegretol to be great, no side affects only need a blood test every 3 months and it has done wonders for stabilizing me, I am a rapid cycler but now I can go for months without a mood change. I do need to take Paxil with it to help with the depression."

I have had on average 4-5 seizures per year, especially when I get extremely stressed out. I can't work, and had 2 seizures on September 6th in the same day. I am having trouble getting help with Medicaid (Maine Health care) & food stamps. I know what everyone who has this feels like, I did not get it until I was 39.

8/16/2003 11:14:21 PM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder predominant inattentive type Report ,"Symptom Patching Carbamazepine treats moodiness or seizures. Basically takes away the ability to understand anything but logic. (To some degree) So, if you want to treat the flu with anti-histamines go for it. ADD-er's aren't moody, they're mentally or physically hyperactive or unable to hone in on one signal. It’s a disability not an attitude. The attitude is due to disgruntledness. It will go away with proper treatment. Get exercise, find something to help focus, and give up the mental battle."

This is the only prescription drug I take regularly, so at first I was slightly intimidated by the absolutely terrifying list of side-effects mentioned on the accompanying leaflet, until I realised that the majority are enormously rare.<p> I don't need to take a very high dose, but have been very satisfied with carbamazepine. I've had both the Tegretol and Epimaz brands, and have found both equally effective, in that I haven't had a seizure in the 2-3 years I've been taking them, except for a couple of possible partials, so small that I couldn't be sure.<p> Side-effects? Well, none, really, unless you count the silver paper from the blister pack occasionally getting stuck to a tablet and ending on a filling, which hurts like heck! I've been on carbamazepine ever since being diagnosed, so can't comment on other treatments' effectiveness... but they'd have to be exceptional to beat this. (NB: I put ""N/A"" for Cost-Effectiveness as I'm British, and NHS prescriptions are free for those requiring continuous anti-epilepsy medication.)"

I was taking topamax and couldn't afford my $120.00 a month prescription. A doctor prescribed tegretol saying it was similar to topomax. I feel like I was swimming in a murky pool for the last 4 months. I didn't know I felt so bad off my meds until I started taking something again. I feel normal again after 2 days. and the cost was only 23.00 for a month and a half. Thank God!!

I haven't had a hint of a seizure whereas Dilantin made me worse. Side effects?? Weight gain would have to be the main one though my age of 53 might also contribute to that. I quit smoking 5 years ago and I'm told that can cause weight gain in a lot of people. Another side effect is occasional impotence. Other than that, nothing I can think of.

I put in for a pension with US SSA in 2000 and received benefits retroactive to 2000 in 2002. I can facilitate anyone with my two years experience to get this pension if they desire. My doctor and I are best of friends. He is the one who has saved me from suicide and he is the one who suggested Tegretol back in 1996!! I combine tegretol with lithium 900mg daily and if I dont consume alcohol with these I lead a pretty normal life. I have a hard time getting employment here in Panama though."

In fact for a week straight I went through an actual crying state when I cried almost straight for 24 hours. Other side effects were sedation, but after the first week was through everything was back to normal - in fact better. I find the drug to be very helpful as long as you get past the beginning stage. Also, sometimes the side effects reoccur when they up the dosage, and you have to get a lot of blood work done - like once a month for me or when they change my dosage."

I hate to get my blood drawn, so I have a problem with maintaining a theraputic level measured by blood. Prior to this drug I was hospitalized 10 times in three years. Since tegretol, I have been in the hospital once. That was because I stopped taking it. Sometimes I feel lethargic and I hate that about this drug."

The dose was gradually increased from 200mg daily to 3X 200mg daily. The episodes became shorter and farther apart, but I still had them.

12/7/2002 6:10:57 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Epilepsy Report ,"Tegratol I've been taking this drug for 4 years now. Every year or two I have an upward adjustment in the dosage of medication. I have this past week been increased from 1000mg/day to 1200mg/day. The major side effect that I see is that I become very slugish. My desire to play sports or maintain an active live style is decreased for about 4 to 8 weeks, until I adjust. As a result, weight gain is not uncommon. I personally find that when I have a large amount of stress at work for an extended period of time (couple weeks), the drugs effectiveness is decreased. The seisuze usually occurs once I start to relax, after a stressful period. The doctors have now added frisium to my list of drugs. Does anyone have any experiences they would be willing to share about this drug? What should I expect? Thanks."

Within a month of taking Tegretol her immune system was decimated. We could not keep her healthy. She had a horrible battle with mononucleosis during this period and relapsed within two months. We had to take her off of Tegretol and her immune system improved immediately. The Tegretol did seem to help with the depression - but she was not physically able to tolerate the dosage - at the level needed to treat her disorder. She was a premature baby and has asthma so it may be that her somewhat delicate immune system was a factor for her that may not effect others.
