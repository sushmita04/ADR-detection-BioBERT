The dizziness went away soon after. I slept very well. Woke up with an intense headache and very dry mouth. Very tired the next morning still. I am taking diazepam 10mg every morning for my chronic anxiety. Please be careful when using the two. The side effects are worse. Otherwise it helped a lot with the pain and can assist to sleep through pain."

6/9/2009 9:31:43 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Headache Report ,"I suffer from terrible tension headaches. No over the counter medication helps relieve the pain for me. For the past two years I have been taking a very low dose (often half of a pill) on an as needed basis for tension headaches. It relieves my headaches quickly and lasts four hours and often all day. The only negative side effect I have noticed is that my hearing is somewhat sensitive after a few hours of taking the pill...nothing not tolerable, but it's definetely a different sensation from anything I've been used to. I would highly recommend this medication to relieve tension headaches and migraines."

Ultracet is pretty miraculous- completely different than Codeine, or any other pain med I have tried. It helps the pain, has no side effect except a minor amount of constipation if I don't watch my diet (I have a condition that pre-disposes me to that). I recommend it highly- I have taken it over time as needed, but lately have been in more pain, so if I take two at once, one time a day, it seems to knock my neck or back pain out, and I don't have to take more. I usually take it with 600mg Motrin, and there is no interaction. What a relief!"

They'd all just rather give me expensive antidepressants that make me throw up when I am not depressed. TIP - get Tramadol instead of ultracet. Add in your own 500 mg tylenol. The cost difference is huge. I just got a refill of 60 for 9.48 at Wal-Mart. That will do me 3 months or so. Can't beat that!"

3/16/2006 6:11:39 PM,5 Stars,Rated  for Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) Report ,"Ultracet I have been using Ultracet for some time now for the pain of fibromyalgia. This is a great drug for easing pain. I think it is called the ""Smart Drug"". I use it every morning when I wake up and this gets me through the day much easier. It can make me a little drousy but it can also keep me awake at night. Doctors won't tell you that it can keep you awake at night so beware. This is why I only take it in the morning and I take something else at night. I went to one of the top fibromyalgia doctors who didnt even advise me that this drug can keep you awake at night if taken too late in the day. But I believe it even mentions this fact on the Ultracet website. I prefer the name brand over the generic. I do believe there is a difference. So, if you can get the real thing I would advise that. I do not take every 2 -4 hours as selected above. That was my only choice in the boxes when I filled out this quesionaire."

On days when I wake up feeling like ""today is a lost cause"", I will take an Ultram & within 15 minutes feel so much better. Often I feel like I am ""speeding"" a bit & then sort of come down from it later & get tired. To me it's a Godsent. There are days when the pain is just so excruciating that I have to take Vicaden, which iis, of course, much stronger, but addictive. I try not & just stick with the Ultram. I would like, very much to send in a photo & be able to write some articles so that we can share experiences & help each other. Fibromyalgia & CFS are very lonely diseases.

12/14/2005 7:04:39 PM,1.5 Stars,Rated  for Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) Report ,Ultracet - Big disappointment This is a worthless drug in my opinion. My Rheumatologist (not any more) gave this to me because he didn't like to prescribe narcodics. Well...suffing along I did until I finally found a new doctor that prescribed oxycontin. What a relief. For those of you that can't find a doc that will prescribe what really works - keep trying. Several doctors later I finally found a keeper. Don't give up no matter how much you try to convince yourself (after hearing it so much) that it is all in your head. I actually had one doctor tell me that even if I feel the pain (like a torn muscle or something) that my muscles were really okay - it was just my brain malfunctioning and that I should continue to work through the pain. What a crock!!! Pain is pain...get something for it so you can have a life again.

Recently I had been in my biggest flareup in years. I was practically bed-ridden with the pain. After taking just three pills of this one day -- the next day I felt like a totally new woman. I am 100% pain free. I had to fight my doc tooth and nail to get this drug. I don't know how long this will last -- I have had lots of experience with drugs working for a while and then having no effect. But for now I am going to enjoy my total freedom from pain. The thing is, see, when I am free of pain that means I can exercise and do fun things, which then lifts my spirits and improves my overall health. Now I am using just one tablet in the afternoon and one right before bed. That seems to be plenty for me. And my body is mightily resistant to most other drugs! As for addiction -- well, I am addicted to not being in pain. Who wouldn't be? If you feel constant, debilitating pain every day of your life, and then one day you are painfree because of a pill, of course you are going to want to take the drug. What's wrong with that???? That's not ADDICTION! That's TREATMENT FOR PAIN! I know it's not going to work for everyone, but the drugs that work for other people do diddly squat for me, or they cause horrible side effects.

Also, it tends to make me hyper and talkative which I don't like. I can't take it later than 3:00p.m. or it keeps me awake.

(Prior to that, I'd had intermittent bouts throughout my adult life.) And never before February had I been such a 'text book' example of fibro. In fact I didn't even know that some of the more severe symptoms (sleep disorder, irritable bowel) existed. I have found three interventions most effective since Feb. First, I purchased a Nikken mattress pad. It has hundreds of magnets on its surface. I immediately noticed aproximately a 30% reduction in pain - especially in the morning upon awakening. Secondly, Provigil, ""gave me back my life"". Prior to trying this I was so depressed I could barely function. I was a ""brain fog"" poster girl. benefits were noticed within 2 days. And just last week, I began taking Ultracet. For the first time in 8 months, I have had 9 consecutive nights of restful sleep! And whether or not the symptom of dry, burning mouth was related to poor sleep,I'm not sure. But since starting Ultracet, I have found a significant improvement in my ability to tolerate food. My mouth has stopped burning, my tongue is no longer bright red. It now has the coating it's supposed to have on it. This is a horrible confounding disease. I was stunned to see how pervasive and limiting it could be in its 'purest' form. As far as pain is concerned, I have noticed very little improvement. I have been taking lortab and that still seems to be the most effective. I highly recommend being aggressive and proactive in your self-care. Demand a doctor who understands this disorder and who sees it in his practice regularly. Otherwise, you will be selling yourself short. God bless."

In June, I started taking Effexor XR for the FMS and it helped with the pain but the weakness never went away. Because I work in retail we are extremely busy and it started taking a toll on my body. I got a new RX of Ultracet and Soma. I did not research the interaction between Effexor and the other two drugs and I paid for it. The first night I took 1 ultracet during the day and I was fine. I took 1 Soma that night to relax my muscles and help me get a good nights sleep. I started to itch that night. I didn't think anything of it and took two Ultracet the next day before work. I was covered in Hives from head to toe. I thought maybe I took too much Ultracet so I still took a Soma that night. The hives went away but the swelling began. The next morning, I only took one Ultracet and by the time I got to work the hives were back but not as bad. In addition to hives I was swollen from head to toe. I felt like my head was in a vice. I stopped taking both then. I didn't read the info that comes with the medication initially because I took it before. It said in big bold letters, ""Call doctor immediatley if you have hives or swelling of the face."" This applied to both medications. I did some research online and apparently Effexor and Ultracet together can cause seizures, hives, and swelling.

The typical NSAID was counter productive, over time, as they upset my stomach and required Prilosec as an additional treatment. While Ultracet is effective for my arthritis, it does not carry over as well as many NSAIDs did for me. It helps with pain for arthritis in my knees and shoulder, as prescribed, and it works as long as I take this. Ultracet does not help me in the long term, as it does not alleviate much of the swelling that occurs in my knees or shoulder. I'd much prefer Relafen (without its side effects) or Ibuprofen along with hydrocodone. Again, I would require Prilosec or alternative, and hydrocodone does lead to long-term use- for me at least. Ultracet is as effective for me as a duragesic patch and delivers pain relief much sooner. The patch is very expensive though and remains cost prohibitive in the long-term. I am now taking Ultram at 100mg. doses, 3 x D. I have yet to find the perfect medication for my specific requirements, though exercise and physical therapy have worked very well along with Ultram."

Any hope of sleep tonight seems fruitless. Was relaxed and happy when I took the medication. This drug is obviously not for everyone and I have a busy day tomorrow. I wish my doctor had looked more closely at my history and possible drug interactions before insisting I take this. I am to take one half tablet every 12 hours. Thank goodness he didn't give me a normal dose. There is no telling what I'd be doing now. Definitely do not intend to take another.

I have taken it for 24 hrs as prescribed. 1-2 tablets every 4 hours...I felt absolutely no relief..just a general ""dopiness"".. I do not like this product. I spent over 50 bucks for this...and I can't afford to throw money away like this. I'm going to tell my doctor...this product stinks."
8/5/2002 2:26:38 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Osteoarthritis Report ,Ultracet doesn't compare to percocet This was given to me instead of the normal percocet that I take. It was like a sugar pill to me and made me sweat profusely. I also got very nausiated and when it wore off I got a terrible headache. It is also very expensive. I am not impressed with it at all.
8/2/2002 2:00:29 AM,4 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Vicodin with a kick I was just prescribed this drug while I am experiencing severe headaches. I am currently awaiting test results for Lupus. I found the drug to be effective, however I did have some nausea as well as itching (mainly on torso) while taking it. The dosage that I am on is only 1-2 every 12 hours for pain as needed. So far I've only had to take one. It took my headache away, although it took away my personality as well as alertness too."
7/25/2002 3:10:45 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Osteoarthritis Report ,"Ultracet Effective pain management, but you build up a tolerance to it quickly. Have cut back my dosage and I am having nausea and headaches everyday. Hopefully this will subside after four of five days, it's been only three so far. Tended to give me headaches at two per dose, so I took 1.5 at 3 times daily."

7/5/2002 9:00:06 PM,2.5 Stars,Rated  for Herniated discs Report ,"So So for back I've been taking Ultracet for approx 3 months on an ""as needed"" basis for my chronic lower back pain and can honestly say that Execedrin and/or 600 mg of Ibuprofen seem to work better. At times I also seem to have ""dizzy/nausea"" spells after taking 2 of these so I lower it to 1 but then there's zero relief; so I'm between a rock and a hard place. That's my opinion."
6/29/2002 2:25:17 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) Report ,"Ultracet side effects Both Ultram and Ultracet have helped my fibromyalgia pain so much that I continue trying to tolerate the side effects, worst of which is nausea/vomiting. After finally tolerating a miniscule dose of 25mg Ultram 3x/day (I am underweight so often take reduced doses of meds) I'm trying 1 Ultracet 3x/day (every 6 hrs), and having to take it with an antihistamine because of itching. But this very small increase in Tramadol brought on nausea/vomiting again. Doc advised taking only 2 Ultracet/day. I'm wondering if it's worth it to keep trying this drug...but I'm afraid to stop taking it because of terrible withdrawal stuff (bad intestinal cramps, explosive diarrhea, even worse nausea). I'm feeling like this is a Catch 22. Does anyone else relate to this, or can anyone offer advice?"

6/1/2002 5:01:24 AM,2 Stars,Rated  for Osteoarthritis Report ,Ultracet I took two pills and up to 4 hours later I had felt as if I had taken nothing. It did not work on my pain in the least. I am not impressed at all with this drug.

I decreased my dosage to a half 3-4 times a day. I also noticed an increase in urination and thirst. 1st week was fairly effective, 2nd week notice nerves were edgy, 3rd week and on, extremely tired and still in a lot of pain. The ultracet does seem to take the edge of pain down enough to allow me to do some work a few hours aday."
