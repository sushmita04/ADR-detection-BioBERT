I get my migraine for about 3 days every single month, like clockwork either before or during period. Before finding this medicine, I ended up in the urgent care one time because I had thrown up enough from migraine I was getting dehydrated. Started taking this by nasal spray and it gives me relief in about 5-10 minutes. It lasts about 5-6 hrs and then often comes back if in that 3-day time period. No more throwing up, no more laying in bed for those 3 days. I always worry about long-term effects of drugs but it's affected my qualify of life so much that I always make sure I have it on hand now for that one week a month. It's been a total blessing."

This is when your stomach essentially shuts down when you get a migraine and it can’t absorb anything. My consultant finally explained this to me and I was prescribed sumatriptan in injection form. After 20 years of taking tablets and them being totally ineffective. The very next migraine I use the injection and within 10 minutes I can feel it subsidising. I do have to sleep it off but this is a miracle for me and is the first thing that has remotely done anything to help. Fantastic"

More fat, less pain, and I never hit a vein that squirts blood after removal of needle. Giving myself an injection no longer an issue at all. Relief usually within 60 or so minutes. *** ladies, it does not work on my menstrual /hormonal migraines."

I’ve been to many doctors and tried many different prescriptions from suppositories to dainty little pills without help. When Imitrex injections found its way to my life, I knew I found a remedy for life. I would give myself a shot on the fleshy part of my hip, wait about a minute or two, and then I would experience the steel gates in my head unlock. Then, I would fall asleep for about an hour. When I awoke, the headache was completely gone. I had energy, I was thinking clearly and I pulled myself together marveling about how much better I felt. My experience was always the same. Each time I used the injection I experienced 100% relief. I will confess the giving myself an injection was something I had to overcome. Usually I had my husband nearby to look in on me to make sure I was okay but after many Times, I started feeling more confident. I call Imitrex a miracle drug. Don’t give up on it!"

Migraine is not big on the list of my health issues but when I do get one the Sumatriptan works within a half hour. I take half of a 100 mg. tablet. I've taken a whole one and slept for 3 hours knocking me out. I'm very thankful to my neurologist and the med for giving me relief. It's a small victory when so many meds I've been on for m.s. don't do what they're supposed to. One less ""headache""!! Small joke!"

The doctor did an EKG, CAT scan, and ultrasound on me. Nothing was found. The only thing she found was elevated D diners (which can sometimes indicate blood clots, but none where found) I DID tell her I took an imitrex the night before, but she didn't seem to even investigate that as a possible factor. Now I read on here that many people have chest pain/ tightness as a side effect making them feel like they are having a heart attack. It was my 3rd time taking imitrex, the first 2 times were fine. I won't take it again."
3/27/2019 6:09:24 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"I take 50 mg Sumatriptan for migraines. Most of the time my migraines are not head pain at all but rather vertigo they is extremely sensitive to light, sounds, and head movements. It can be so bad I vomit. After years of trying everything from blood pressure medication (I don’t have blood pressure issues), antidepressants (I don’t suffer from depression), and motion sickness medication, we finally found out that daily magnesium, occasionally Sudafed if I have had a recent cold, and Sumatriptan on the onset of a migraine does the trick. I’m very reactive to most medication and typically take half the dosage but take the full 50 mg of Sumatriptan. When I take it, within 35 minutes I feel a warm feeling up the back of my neck and down my arms through my fingers. I feel almost like I’ve been drinking alcohol but a little more anxious. Within the hour that goes away and I can function again. This is something I have never been able to do on any other medication. I usually have to take a nap to make my migraines go away but having Sumatriptan is a life saver."

Before Imitrex (I am on generic version of Imitrex) I would end up at ER frequently. Thank God for this migraine treatment. I must reiterate however, this only works for true migraine headaches."

The pressure it causes in my shoulders causes a headache as well. I'm not taking this anymore. Honestly I would rather take excedrin, ibuprofen or deal with the migraine than feel like I'm suffocating."
3/6/2019 8:21:59 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"This drug is for migraines period. So if it isn’t working on your headaches, quite possibly you don’t actually have migraines, but rather cluster or tension headaches, which it does not get rid of. As for side effects, all medications have the possibility to cause side effects. Just because it causes them on someone doesn’t mean it will on you. If you are worried about it, go to an ER waiting room to take your first dose. I have been on Imitrex for over 10 years and it has only failed to get rid of my headache twice. Those two times I assume we’re not migraines. Best migraine medication on the market, FOR TRUE MIGRAINES"
2/16/2019 10:46:24 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Headache - Cluster Report ,"I've had chronic cluster headaches for nearly 20 years. I was episodic for 12 years before that. Imitrex and its generic, sumatriptan has saved my life without a doubt. It stops my cluster attacks within 15-20 minutes everytime. No other drug has even come close to the relief I get from Imitrex. No amount of narcotics, not even IV narcotics help me like Imitrex dose. I use it multiple times a day as soon as an attack begins. I would be dead today without Imitrex. I seriously doubt ANYONE, ANYWHERE has used more Imitrex than I have. Also, I've never experienced any serious side effects from using it, although I do believe it can cause ""rebound headaches"" when used too often. I am ""Mr Clusters""."

Let me just tell you that depending on the severity of my migraines sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. However, when I have Med migraines this medicine works wonders on me. I dont know why but with in 1 hour of taking this medication I feel amazing!! I am pain free for 12 hours, takes effect for 12 hours. so in a 24 hour period I take 2 100mg tablets. I do sometimes very rarely feel tightness in my chest after taking it and sometimes when my migraines are too strong I feel drugged out after taking it and really really sleepy. and when its one of those terrible migraines, I take the pill but have to add 2 Alkazeltzer to feel a bit better but feel zoned out for hours. Anyways, I love this medication for making me feel back to myself again!"

I have developed autoimmune disorders and when I have a migraine during a flare, the shot will at least knock the burning edge off so I can deal. I hope you all find something that works for you and eases your pain."

I take a generic of this medication and it works amazingly well for my migraines. as soon as I get an aura which is ringing in my ears I take 50mg and within 15 minutes I'm fine. I'd had migraines for years but my parents never believed me. so I insisted we talk to my doctor and then it was discovered I have a chronic condition with them. I was then prescribed this medication and I cannot imagine my life without it. I highly recommend it if you have a chronic headache condition as it works well for me

When I get headaches they last for days if not weeks so the medicine was prescribed as a rescue medication to stop the migraine in its tracks when my bar/caf/asp pill isn't doing it. I took this medication and I felt like I was dying. I got very heavy, then my throat started tightening, inside my ears were tingling, my hands tingled, I felt like I was going to vomit. I felt like I didn't know where i was, I also had a tightness at the base of my skull. The pain in my shoulders and neck from the migraine became so apparent. It has been two hours since I took this medication and my pain has gone from migraine to headache. I feel like I'm going to wake up in the morning and the pain is still going to be there. This medication is not worth it to be. I rather have a migraine. My doctor explained all these side effects to me and told me they hardly ever happen so I felt safe but honestly stay away from this medication. Try a bar/caf/asp"

It makes the pain go away almost completely. Yes, there are side effects, for me those are slight dizziness, brain fog and sleepiness. Also, heavy feeling in my hands and throat tightness. So, there are unpleasant side effects, but they sure as hell beat level 10 pain that used to leave me bedridden and in tears for entire day."

Migraine persisted. Spoke to my doctor who upped my dossage to 50 mg and I only need to take one. Today is a especially bad day where I woke up extremely dizzy (where you walk into walls and doorways because you can't walk straight) as well as had the usual aura the previous day and stars. Instead of a migraine running out of the gate as i woke up, it transitioned slowly today. I took my Imitrex and started to feel the migraine dissapate, however usually comes with feelings of being warm in my arms/legs as well as feeling weak. To me, it feels similar when you are starting to get a buzz from alcohol. Makes me slightly uncomfortable but is much better than dealing with unbearable migraine pain."
12/31/2018 6:12:48 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Have been suffering from migraines for several years. Accompanied by Auras, nausea, light/sound/smell/cold sensitivity, the works. Truly awful living in fear of getting a migraine due to outside factors such as a temperature drop or walking past someone with strong cologne. I would miss work and I was unable to be the mother I want to be for my children. Very depressing. Then I was prescribed Imitrex...and wow. At first I was reluctant to try this medication after reading some of the negative reviews. So I waited for a migraine to hit at home where my huband was around to bring me to the ER god forbid I had a reaction. Well, I had no negative reaction whatsoever. It was the exact opposite. I could feel the head pain and nausea evaporate from my body...the way I would fantasize about during my day(s) long attacks. Within 30 minutes the migraine was completely gone. Truly amazing. Imitrex did make me sleepy and feel warm, but those feelings were welcomed (I suffer insomnia and cold sensitivity) This drug has changed my life. I pray it continues to work."
9/25/2018 11:53:08 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Ive had migraines for years, since I was 7 years old. I’ve been on every medication that can be described for this unbearable pain and Sumatriptan is the only medicine that works for me. Headaches and migraines are different because migraines make it unbearable to live a normal life. Before sumatriptan I couldn’t keep a job or a relationship because it’s hard to explain an excruciating pain that’s not visible. Taking Sumitriptan gave me my life back and I can feel confident leaving my house everyday knowing I have a reliable medication to help me when I get a migraine. Like every other medicine out there, sumitriptan has its side effects, but it’s nothing compared the weekly pain I had to suffer for the last 23 years. If you’re sick of taking multiple medications everyday to “prevent” migraines and want something that’ll relieve it right away, take sumitriptan."

The second one I took a few weeks later cause a seizure, which at the time I was not really sure at the time until a couple of days ago. I just got home from a few days at the hospital because of Imitrex. I took the pill and within 5 - 10 my entire right side of my body was not working, I had lost all straight. When the ambulance got me to the hospital I was being treated as a stroke victim. I took about 5 hours for my right side to get strength back to my right side. And most of all lucky for me I kept telling them I didn't think I had a stroke that I thought the Imitrex caused it and refused the tissue plasminogen activator for stroke that they wanted to give me. They now have me on a Tylenol based migraine medication. Imitrex almost cost me my life."

I tried oxygen for a while, but it just seemed to push the headache off for a few hours. I tried the nasal spray once, it worked just fine, not as quick as the injectors (no shocker), but it did shut the headache down fairly quickly. My biggest problem is getting enough injections to finish the cluster attack (I'm on TriCare). My last cluster (knock wood) has been about 5yrs ago, I went thru about 130 injections. I had to get the patient advocacy officer involved, so a little more hassle, but I got the injectors I needed."

I would lay in bed with all the lights out crying because of how horrible the pain and nausea were. I couldn’t go to school because I couldn’t focus and would throw up in class. Thanks to Imitrex I finally have my life back again. Migraines that used to last 2-3 days at a time are now completely gone after a 50-100mg dose.

Anyways I never like reading drug reviews before taking them because they can cause unnecessary anxiety / priming effect. This drug doesn't work for me. I had a moderate headache and tried it, within 30 minutes my head was in a lot of pain, a pain I had never felt before like every single blood vessel was closing. My mood became worse. Tightening of the throat, chest, and it hurt to even talk. Nausea was a big issue. It also made me drowsy. I called my friend and joked if I die, call the police. I ended up falling asleep for 4 hrs and feel much better now. Well, yeah. It also increases seratonin, so I wouldn't recommend taking it if you already are taking some SSRI/SNRI Worth a shot, but don't try it for the first time if you have something important coming up."

Well I did out of desperation with my phone by my side and told my partner of my concerns. Usually I am at the mercy of time. I waited long enough on Tylenol and Advil that I was resulting to the binaural beats, herbal teas, cold rag, self massage in a dark quiet room. Then my curiosity caved and right now I can look at this screen and type up a review of this miracle. I did get sleepy ( as in instead of laying in misery I thought I could actually fall asleep). If I get up to fast I do get dizzy, but I can get up with the lights on. The throbbing in the temples is so much less that I don't even notice it. Reviews are not something I normally do but this the exception. I wish I would have found this sooner."

Side effects I experience are chest tightness, skin sensitivity, brain fog and facial flushing; uncomfortable but preferable to a migraine.

10/18/2017 5:10:25 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Headache Report ,"I took this for tension headaches and it is the first medication I have ever had a reaction to. While my reaction was far less alarming than others I have read about, it was too severe to pass off as simple side effects. Upon taking one oral dose my ankles swelled up like balloons. To make matters worse it also made me feel extremely off mentally, made me very dizzy and gave me a racing heart. I had to call someone to come get me from work because I was so close to passing out I couldn't drive myself home. I'm not saying it isn't worth a try if you suffer a miserable life of headaches, it may end up being your miracle instead of my nightmare but monitor yourself closely for reactions, as it seems to be somewhat common that certain people can't tolerate the medication. After many trials and errors I have been put on Firoicet, which is brilliant and my miracle drug for my tension headaches."

Initially, as a child a migrain would send me to bed for an afternoon. Then as a teenager I would be down for 12 to 24 hours. As an adult, I would be in bed for 24 to 72 hours with no relief. Now I take my imitrex at the first sign of a migrain (aura, visual disturbance, ""funny feeling"") I take a tablet and within 10-15 min. I am fine. The crashing pain never comes and instead of losing a whole day or more in bed, I am on the go again within 30 minutes and sometime don't even have to slow down at all. Imitrex is definately a life changer for me."

I was started on 100mg and it was horrible, so I tried cutting the pills in half down to 50mg (doctor said it was okay), but the side effects were just as bad. I would take Imitrex as soon as I knew I'd be getting a migraine (about 30 - 45 minutes before the migraine), and I would still get a migraine, and a strong, slightly painful, mostly uncomfortable burning feeling in my nose (I took the pill form and not nasal spray, so that was confusing), along with chills, shakiness, strong nausea, sleepiness, and overall felt very sick and weak. I would not recommend. However, I know Imitrex works well for my grandpa, so I do know it works for some people--just be careful."

One 100mg pill provides relief for about 24 hours, sometimes a little less. one time instead of taking it when I woke up in the morning, I had to take another dose at 3am in the morning, the headache came back a little sooner than usually, but most of the time one pill ( 100mg ) will last me 24 hours.

I have not read all the reviews here yet, maybe I am repeating what others have said, but that's ok, proof that it works and its side effects. About 15 years ago I found that taking ibuprofen, aleve or any other pain reliever WITH the Imitrex will cancel some of the side effects I've been having from the Imitrex: muscle pain, tightness in my neck, as well as overemphasis of anything wrong with me at the time (if I had a sunburn, the Imitrex will make me feel like I was on live fire; if my teeth were sensitive, the Imitrex made them 10x more sensitive; you get the idea:) Then they came out with Treximet (imitrex+aleve), much more expensive than Imitrex alone, made me wish I pitched the idea to GSK and make some money off of it:).

I do have some minor side effects, but they are tolerable. Mainly mild discomfort in my jaw. Also if I eat anything hot or cold it magnifies the sensation. Same with eating something sweet or tart. Also if I take a shower within a couple hours of taking it the shower feels twice as hot as it really is. Odd, but I think it is because of how it effects the blood vessels.

Imitrex was the first medication I have taken that actually has the ability to stop my migraine headaches dead in their tracks. I have been taking it for about 6 years now, and I am writing this review now because were it not for Imitrex, I would be lying in bed right now in agony, unable to do anything, even open my eyes or listen to music, or smell things without feeling nauseous. Every migraine is different, and this one may not work for you. But if you are thinking about give it a try, I urge you to do so. Over the years, this simple medication has saved me weeks of my life that I would have spent lying in bed totally useless. I take a 50mg pill, and my headache fades within 30 minutes.

When having a migraine, I usually take 100 mgs, lie down in a dark room & in a few hours, my migraine is gone. Sometimes, I need to take another 50 mgs though. It does make me have blurry vision for awhile, be kind of confused & very sleepy, but this goes away after a few hours when migrianes is gone. The side effects are worth not being laid up for 72 hours for me, since I have 3 day migraines. Imitrex relieves nausea from migraine in usually 15 minutes to half hour after taking.

If I took the medication at the onset of my vision problems it would stop the headache from occurring. It would take awhile for my vision to return to normal but I would not get the pain. But if I was to late in taking the medicine then the pain would start and I was in for the long haul. I have had 2 reactions to this drug that resulted to being hospitalized. The first time was after taking the second dosage with my doctors approval. We think Claritin-D taken many hours earlier may have interacted with it. That was a an emergency visit only. The second time was a 9 day hospitalization due to the reaction I had between Imitrex and antidepressants. I had seen my doctor the day I took the Imitrex and was given the OK to take the drug while on the other medications. So be very careful.

When I entered the perimenopause & menopause time of life, I was having so many severe migraines and took so many Imitrex, etc. that they stopped working as well after a few months. I now try to take the triptans including Imitrex as little as possible for that reason and because of potential for dangerous side effects listed now that I am getting older. This is difficult when I can't seem to find an acceptable preventive that works without intolerable side effects. I also absolutely HAVE to work 40 hours a week so I can't be too loopy on pain meds either which my neurologist finally gave me because I was suffering so much.

There are no side-effects that I know of. In the beginning it worked really well for me but I think that my head-aches have not been fully addressed by doctors. They really interrupt my day. I've had other health problems to deal with though and that's probably why I haven't gotten real relief from the Imitrex. It does take care of the pain you have at the moment but it doesn't prevent them from happening in the first place. I haven't come across a drug that can do this yet. I'm hoping to try something else in the near future that would help. If anyone reading this knows of something that would take these headaches away I would really appreciate it.
9/26/2006 2:51:12 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"good and bad About the same time I received my first prescription (April 2004) I figured out how to manage my migraines. Sometimes I fall a little short on my management and need an abortive therapy. I went through 3 cards of 100mg (1 pill left). It takes about 30-45 minutes to start working and about 15 minutes to completely take the pain away. The residual fog varies depending on how bad the pain was. Sometimes it completely takes away the migraine and sometimes it only lasts for about18 hours. I traditionally have 3-day migraines and have never had to take more than 4 Imitrex, and only did that once or twice. I recently started taking 50Mg and it takes an hour to hour and a half to start working. The one migraine I have had since the switch came back 12 hours later (took 3 doses before my management kicked in) I hate the side effects...pain in my upper arms. Dr said that just means it is working, but I don't buy it! I am concerned about the ramifications of long term use. (Update 9/26/6) I recently made a series of dr visits over 3 consecutive days, due to a sudden case of vertigo (my first). The Third day I woke up with a migraine. So, I took an Imitrex. Eventually the pain went away. On the previous visits they took my BP and it was something like 117/72 & 118/79. On the third day, after taking the Imitrex, my BP was 168/102.

After 35 years of suffering with migraines as often as 8 times per month, and not wanting to be ""a guinea pig"", I heard about this drug, and decided that this medication was worth a try. If taken at the FIRST sign of a migraine, I find that within 15-20 minutes the nausea all but disappears, then shortly after that the pain and light sensitivity go away! No more spending half my life laid up in a dark room with cold cloths or hot packs and a handy pail! The only side effects I have experienced are slight fatigue (but lying down for half-hour is still far preferable to day/s in bed!)and a dry mouth. This passes after a few hours. I know this drug doesn't work for everyone, but if anyone reading this feels as I did (""no way do I want to be a guinea pig for the pharmaceutical industry!""), rest assured things have come a long way. Sumatriptan is worth trying. It has revolutionized my life and given me back the time with my family that was robbed before by migraines."

Feelings went away within 5 minutes, but I threw away my remaining doses and never used it again. No family history of anything cardiac at all: my cholesterol and triglycerides are fine, BP low etc - even after extensive workup I had no indications of CAD. 11 years later I still don't: but I'm thinking that I had read - maybe even on the package insert - about this med causing cardiac symtoms and problems in people without any hx or indicators for, coronary heart disease. Maybe even a few heart attacks in those people? Wasn't there a lawsuit? Anyway, to sum it up - I'll never touch it again."
8/22/2006 7:09:11 PM,1 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imitrex My migraines have been through the roof on the pain scale lately. I can't use Imitrex anymore due to the fact that my blood pressure has been very high when I have a migraine (and pain from Fibromyalgia and other disorders) and the last time I used it, I had very bad reactions to it. I thought my head was going to split open and I lost my hearing for about 2 hours. This medication used to help alot, but not anymore. I just got some information on Imitrex from Harvard Medical School regarding taking Imitrex and SSRI's such as Zoloft (which I take). The combination of these drugs causes ""Serotonin Syndrome"". This info was published July, 2006. It can cause mental changes, nerve and muscle symptoms, temperature or vital sign control problems and digestive symptoms. The site I got this from is www.intelihealth.com. It was very important info for me as the last time I had a migraine, I took Imitrex and had alot of the symptoms. I printed this out and will be discussing it with my doc on my next visit. Very scary...at least for me."

And when it does not, it is usually because I waited too long to take it, as I am reluctant to overuse it. I usually only need the one shot, only occasionally have I used two in one day. The side effects are the worst. I don't feel the best when I am using it. A bit dizzy and sick... sometimes my heart rate goes funky on me. I will note that since my Inderal has been increased to 180 mg and I have been having some erratic heart rate problems... taking Imitrex has caused some dramtic slowing of my heart, trouble breathing and chest pain. So I would be careful when combining it with some of the preventatives which cause a drop in blood pressure and heart rate."

I started using the product back in 1998, but I did have to stop using it for a while because it lost its effectiveness for me. I've found this with other triptans, too.

I have struggled with migraines since the age of twelve and worked my way through Anacin, Excedrin,Inderal, and Midrin before my OB-GYN suggested the Imitrex injections. While the injections are not pleasant, they are definitely better than the headache. Today I simply use the tablet form. I have embraced healthy eating habits and exercise regualarly, but am still suspectible to attacks due to stress or particularly weather changes. I do work with a neurologist now and feel that I'm in very good hands. I would offer one word of caution though. I tried using Topomax to ward off headaches, and it was _highly_ successful. However, I became so forgetful that I was unable to do my job effectively. I had to forgo the Topomax for quality of life - couldn't just go ""drifting along.""

Neither the frequency nor the severity of my attacks have increased since using Imitrex. The only drawback I can really find with Imitrex is the cost. I cannot afford the injections without insurance and my insurance (Aetna sucks) only provides me with 4 Statdose Kits per month. Even though my doctor has documented my need for higher quantities and has written letters of medical necessity, they have denied every appeal (did I mention Aetna sucks?).

Once I started using the Imitrex injection for my migraines there was no turning back. I started using it in 1996 and had have been using it ever since. Normally I can overcome a severe migraine with a single dose. Sometimes I have to use a follow-up within a couple hours to keep working through the day. I have found that sometimes if I take Imitrex more than three days in a row I can get rebound migraines just from the Imitrex so I have to just 'go it alone' with Excedrin for 24-36 hours to stop the rebounds. I have tried the oral Imitrex and other oral Triptans but my stomach seems to shut down when I have an oncoming migraine so no amount of oral medication helps me under this circumstance. My goal over the past years has been to find my daily medication to reduce the number of Imitrex injections per month due to the cost. I went through all of the basic meds such as Midrin, Inderal, etc. until I finally came across Topamax (you can read my rating there). I reduced my Imitrex use by about 80% with this. I think all of us migraine sufferers just need to be patient and take the time to find our 'daily meds' to combat these nasty things we were dealt and enjoy the good days when we have them.

I've been taking it since 1998 and it still works. I haven't had to up my dose either. I average about 9 migraine days per month. Usually, one 25mg. tablet will knock a headache out within an hour of taking it. About half the time, the headache comes back 24 hours later, but I seldom have to take more than 2 Imitrex tablets per episode, and the episodes seldom last more than 2 days. Not only does the drug knock out the headaches, but I actually get a slight lift from it. I am fortunate. I don't have any side effects at all. The only downside of this drug is the cost, especially since it's not in generic form yet. I've worked around this by having my doc prescribe 50 mg. tabs (which is the standard dose anyway), and I use a pill cutter to divide them. The insert says ""Do not cut pills in half,"" but I always do and my head hasn't fallen off. They make it hard to do this by making the pills in triangular form. I think it's their way to prevent people from doing it. Anyway, it cuts my cost in half, since I can get twice the amount for the same cost if I cut the pills in half."

My former physician told me to take 3 doses and it caused rebound migraines for days. The risks are just not worth taking this drug: extreme drowsiness (sometimes), bone thinning, and heart problems. I'd rather take some lemon balm (melissa), wood betony, white willow bark, and get some sleep."

8/25/2005 9:24:58 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"IMITREX-MAGNESIUM-SUNTHEANINE I've used Imitrex 50mg for many years. I find it works best if I take it when I feel the precusor of a migraine coming...yawning every minute or so. 50mg stops it from happening. I have found 7 causes of my migraines: too much caffeine, chocolate (theobromine in some chocolates=instant headache), salt, lack of fresh air, not enough water, too much cinnamon & not taking the mineral magnesium daily. MAGNESIUM gluconate (250-500mg) daily helps prevent migraines. Iit is also good for the heart, muscles, nerves and blood pressure. SUNTHEANINE (L-Theanine) will stop the weird ""buzz"" of caffeine [stay awake anyways] & prevent the headache. Make sure it says ""Suntheanine"" on the bottle. Otherwise, the contents are synthetic L-theanine which causes awful headaches! On occasion, when I've had a 2-3 day whopper of a migraine, as a last resort, I call SILENT UNITY (a non-denominational prayer line) at 1-800-669-7729 or 816-969-2000 (out of USA). Online at: http://www.unity.org/ Their prayers always work! They don't ask for money (although I contribute because of the great help) and they will pray for you/anyone or situation 24 hours X 30 days intensive healing prayer. I hope that helps you, my fellow sufferers."

They also restrict it tightly-- my former doc would only give me 4 or 6, which is a joke. What's different now is that I'm on a constant maintenance dose of another pain medication, and my headaches are fewer in number. When they do come, I believe the medication already in my system (duragesic) gives the Imitrex a little boost... Now it works almost every time I take it, with few second doses needed. Side effects: Imitrex usually gives me a brief period of a racing heart feeling, some strage itchiness & tingling in various body parts, then, after about an hour, I feel spaced out & drowsy/exhausted but the pain is gone or lessened. I can't go do a bunch of stuff on Imitrex, but some people I've talked to are just like ""new"" after taking it. It's very expensive and both doctors & insurance tightly restrict how much you can have. If you pay out of pocket there MANY better choices."

Imetrex is most effective when taken at the ONSET of a migraine, so I keep one with me at all times. Food triggers must still be watched; as avoiding certain foods and drinks (sugar-laden foods; red wine & beer especially) will trigger a migraine for me. I don't take the 100 mg tablets because they make me feel 'spacey'.

Only 2 or 3 times I have had to follow with a second injection in an hour for it to work. It's like I never had one to begin with. The thought of an injection doesn't please me but it is a self-injector and you don't even see the needle. When the dosage goes into the body it stings a bit. The cost is extremely high and now I no longer have insurance so don't know how much longer I can continue to use my ""miracle cure"". I have tried Imitres tablets with maybe 50% or less satisfaction. They too are priced high, but I can get these in Mexico in a box of 9 for about $18. The injections are not available in Mexico."

8/19/2005 7:26:46 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Works great with no side effects..... I've tried all 3 forms of imitrex and the pills are the form that I use the most. The nasal spray leaves a really nasty after taste that I can do without and they don't give me relief much faster than the pill so I don't mess with them!! I can take an initrix pill and if I've caught the migraine before it's full blown the pill I can feel it working with in 30-45 minutes. The injection is wonderful for those migraines that sneak up on you really fast or come on while you are sleeping, I've found that those usually have gone to far painwise to respond to the pill form but the injection knocks them out. The injection itself really isn't that big of a deal it's a small penlooking device with a really small needle and it's relatively painless. It's not very cost effective to use the injection form as your primary abortive, but they are handy to have in addition to the pills for the ""hummdingers"" that don't respond to anything else. The only side effect I can say I have is an awareness or minor tightnening feeling as the medicine starts working, this causes me no discomfort though so I hate to call it a side effect. I'd also like to clarify that some things like tiredness, feeling hung over etc that people are contributing as side effects of their migraine medications are actually alot of times whats called the ""postdrome"" of a migraine or simply stated the after effects of the migraine itself they would have felt this way whether they had taken any medication or not."

I also experienced tightening of the throat with the injection. Needless to say, I no longer use the injections. The tablets work with a moderate migraine, but when I am vomiting, they're obviously are a complete waste (no pun intended).

Imitrex did not seem to work quickly for me or give me complete relief.

That also did not work for me. Working for a physician's office I decided to ask for another opinion on meds for migraines. I was told to try Relpax. Relpax (40mg) works very well for me, generally within a short period of time if I catch the migraine quickly enough. I have experienced no side effects. As for cost effectiveness, most migraines meds are costly and my insurance co approves only 6 pills a month, which seems to be the norm.

When I first began taking Imitrex for incapacitating migraines, I wanted to bow down and kiss the feet of its inventor!! NOTHING before or since has EVER worked so well. But after the first few doses, I began to have chest pains. I have a family history of heart trouble, but nothing wrong personally, so I continued taking it. Finally, one day, the pain got so bad that I considered calling 911. Additionally, my niece had told me that her 34 y/o neighbor had undergone a heart transplant and there was nothing wrong with her heart prior to her use of Imitrex. And then one of my niece's co-workers who was also an Imitrex user, got a migraine and did what she had done many times before. Gave herself the injection. She was found dead in her office... a heart attack at age 39. So as amazingly effective as the med is for easing a migraine and leaving you functional rather than dopey, I have backed way off from it because of the heart issues."

I have only had to use a 2nd injection 4 or 5 times over the last 6 years. In February 2003, I began taking Topamax which miraculously reduced the incidence of migraines in my life. Imitrex was just as effective for the ones I still have. The only side effect I have noticed is immediately after the injection my neck becomes somewhat stiff and tender and I become somewhat lightheaded. The Imitrex is usually effective in about 45 minutes. Imitrex works for me even when the migraine has been around for a day although sometimes I have a dull headache after using the drug if I wait that long to use the Imitrex to control the migraine but the migraine is gone. Before I took Topamax, I never went anywhere without the Imitrex injector in my purse. Luckily my insurance covers this cost. Ease of use is an 8 because I don't like needles but this shot is always worth the sting. Hope this helps someone else."

Yesterday (12/10/2004) is a good example: I suffer from frequent (2+ attacks per WEEK) migraines complete with aura, sometimes so bad I am completely incapacitated. Yesterday, I was overtired from not getting adequate sleep the night before, which I know is one of my major triggers, and sure enough, around 4 pm a migraine struck and I immediately took an Imitrex and pain meds. It turned out to be one of the worst attacks I've ever suffered, to the point where I nearly begged my husband to take me to the ER. Instead, 2 hours after the first dose of Imitrex, Percocet, and Gabitril, I took another dose of Imitrex, OxyContin, Percocet, Gabitril, Ultram, and Klonopin and waited. I slowly improved, until 10:30 pm when I was finally able to tolerate low levels of light and low volume conversation. The only possible side effect, which could be from either the medication or the migraine itself, is the next morning I wake up feeling hung over. As far as cost goes, this med would be unaffordable to someone without prescription insurance, and even with a good insurance plan, I had to wait a year before it was placed on the formulary list of ""preferred name brand"" drugs."

I've been experiencing migraines since the early 80's, diagnosed with them in the early 90's and started Imitrex Stat-Dose almost as soon as it was available. I was put on every possible migraine med before that, all with terrible side-effects. I've also tried Imitrex pills and nasal sprays but they were ineffective. I experience, on average, one migraine a week, going as high as 8-10 migraines/month. Rarely have I had to use more than 1 shot per migraine, the Imitrex has been that effective for me, with relief coming usually within 30 minutes or less. I had to rate Cost Effectiveness as N/A since I was given Imitrex for free while I was active duty military and now I have a copay of only $7.00 for 4 shots. If I had to rate its cost effectiveness it would have to be a 15 on a scale of 1-10. I would pay anything to stop my migraine pain. Imitrex has been a Godsend for me. I don't know what I would do without it. My only complaint with the stat dose system is the pain in my leg as the sumatriptan is being injected. Once the med has been fully injected the pain stops. Is this normal? It doesn't do it all the time, but in varying degrees of pain it occurs in about 75-80% of my injections. Am I doing something wrong?"

I was in the midst of a severe headache and was not very coherent and vomiting heavily by the time they wheeled me in to the ER. I was unaware of any pre-existing conditions or risk associated with Imitrex. Usually they would give me a shot of meperidine/phenergan and let it take affect and send me home. However this time due to the reluctance by the doctor on call to dispense ""narcotics"" they used Imitrex instead. The first thing I remember was my face feeling like it was burning then feeling weak and then nothing until I woke up a few hours later in intensive care. I had some sort of severe reaction and my heart stopped, I had to be resuscitated I later found out and still had a severe headache when I woke up! They are still not sure why this happened to me since I have not been diagnosed with any underlying cardiovascular disease or defects? So be aware of the risks associated with this class of drugs!!! I use a safer alternative nowadays to control my headaches which does not include a triptan. It is a combination of several medications including a strong opioid. This ""cocktail"" approach has been very effective for me for 5+ years now with minimal side effects and is feasible from a financial standpoint. I hope this information helps you avoid the nightmare I went through! There are effective alternatives to triptans for those who like myself either cannot tolerate them and/or find them ineffective.

I am a 38 year old male living in New York and have been suffering from Migraine since I can remember. Throughout this time I have had to rely on Narcotics to control my pain, specifically, Fiorinal w/codeine. It was not until a few years ago that a new neurologist helped me realize that a great deal of my problem stemmed from the use of Narcotics in the form of rebound headaches. Since stopping the Fiorinal and being placed on Beta Blockers, I have been able to greatly control my migraines. I have been using Imitrex since it first became approved for use in the U.S. Now my occasional headaches are most times totally eliminated with one shot of Imitrex. I have found less favorable results with both the Nasal and tablet form of the product. I have gone through a literal 'Hell' with this ailment and do not know where I would be if it were not for my present doctor. Further, if it were not for Imitrex, I would still be relying on Narcotics stuck in a never-ending cycle of rebound headaches. I urge everyone suffering from Migraine who have not found relief to re-evaluate their usage of Narcotics & OTC rememdies.

The key to Imitrex is to take it IMMEDIATELY, as soon as you are reasonably sure you have a migraine. If you wait, the drug is considerably less effective. I found the tablets did not work fast enough for me, so I would most often need two doses to get rid of the pain. The nasal spray is also an option, but for my copay, the shots are the best. They start working in five minutes and you can be pain free in as little as fifteen. The shot kit makes it easy for a layperson to give an injection. If necessary, I can give myself a shot in the ladies room and be back at work in minutes. The creator of Imitrex deserves a medal. No more writhing in bed for three days helpless and in pain! What could be better than that?"

Although they come in 6mg dose, I have learned how to inject myself with 2mg of the 6mg dose to extend this expensive but effective medication. The smaller dosage works just as quickly (5-10 min) and effectively as the larger dose. Imitrex injections have given me my life back. The only side effect I experience is a slight burning sensation at the time of injection and some tightness in the chest. Both are a small price to pay considering the unbeleivable, unbearable, suicidal like pain from a cluster headache. I work partime (30hrs) as I am a single dad raising children. I have no medical coverage which for me is the only other ""side effect"" of taking imitrex injections. I pray my fellow suffers find the same relief I have thru imitrex injections."

Pain shots, pills and the like caused me to be so sick to my stomach, a threw up with every movement. I was immmediately better. The cost was very prohibitive, and I would wait till the last moment. I soon found it was more cost-effective to take one the moment of indication. For I needed fewer and I felt all relieved of pain. My insurance changed and the cost effectiveness was no longer a factor.

Maxalt was effective at first, but having daily headaches resulted in a ""tolerance"" eventually. The Imitrex tablets only made my panic attacks worse, but the injection!! Wow!! For me it means absolute relief within 45 minutes (even better if you can rest/nap while it takes effect). Just be warned about the first ""chest tightening"" feeling that occurs after injection. Nothing will happen to you, it's just scary if you aren't expecting it. Now, I know what to first expect after the injection, and the RELIEF that is soon to follow. I even have a needle phobia, and I still can inject myself because of the nifty little tube the needle hides in. I wouldn't want to use the injection everyday, or with every headache coming on, but for those headaches that make a dark room and social withdrawal the only option, this sure works for me. Good luck to all of you with migraines. For so many years no doctor heard my pleas for help, and, too, please remember that it took Maxalt and Imitrex tablets to fail in order for me to get the injection prescribed. It's so good to know that I will never pray to die as a result of a migraine again! : )"

I have also tried the nasal spray, but don't recommend it. When it runs down the back of your throat, it tastes terrible and now matter how much water you drink you can't wash it away.

I have experienced some of the side-effects (they're very short-lived and not uncomfortable) - I would recommend being able to lie down and rest after using it as it can make you dizzy/tired. My biggest complaint - it's price is $50 an injection. If it weren't so expensive and could be used more frequently than 2x a day (a situation a cluster headache sufferer can encounter needing), it would be even better!

I have tried several different things, such as Amerge, Imitrex nasal spray and tablets. The only thing that helps is the Imitrex injection! It completely takes the pain away within 20 minutes. The worst part for me is the initial side effect, which includes severe head throbbing (10 times worse than the actual migraine). It does go away after about 5 or 10 minutes, and it is definitely worth it, especially since it's the only thing that will take the pain away completely! My only complaint is the cost."
11/20/2002 3:16:37 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,Awesome migraine drug! Imitrex has changed my life! I have suffered severe migraines since the age of 5. I am 35 now. I know longer lie on the bathroom floor heaving from throwing up so much. I used to stay in bed for 3 days until this horrible pain would cease. Imitrex CURES my headache within one hour. I normally use the injections but the 100mg pills get rid of it at the onset. The only side effects I have are heaviness in my chest and throat for about 30 minutes.
11/12/2002 5:19:45 PM,3 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imitrex nasal spray For me it's the fastest acting imitrex, with the least side effects. The pill doesn't work well for me, and the injection takes longer to work and has many more and worse side effects. However, it doesn't always take my headache away, though it always decreases it. Often the headache will come back later the same day or the next morning."

And I have found that the Imitrex injections always work for me regardless of whether I use it at the onset of the migraine or during. I've tried the Imitrex pills up to 300 mg per serious event and just haven't found them to be as effective as the injections. I do experience more neck and jaw tightness with the injections ... but that passes within 10 minutes and then the heachache is also gone. So...I'll take the shots even though I hate needles! And, its much more cost effective than ending up in the Emergency Room for a shot of Demerol and phenergran."

Imitrex takes longer to work than it should (about 1hr) but, wham - it works; migraine gone. Only side effect is you're wiped after the headache is gone but that probably isn't the fault of Imitrex."

10/25/2002 7:16:59 AM,5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,Imitrex is the best I have been using Fiorinal for years for tension headaches. Fiorinal does not work on full blown migraines. Imitrex was a godsend for me. I take the injections. One injection during a full blown migraine and it's completely gone within 10 minutes. Show me any other medication out there that can do that for a full blown migraine.

I also had to take it immediately when I got the aura or it wouldn't work at all. I had increased nausea and giving myself the injection was difficult."

The pills didn't do it for me. I tried everything under the sun. Even the inhaler- but it didn't work for me. The injection usually takes the headache away within 10 minutes for me-- I am so gald to have these. The only thing for me, is that the medicine hurts a tad, going in--- but it's worth it! Peace & Joy~"

It had worked so well for my dad in the past I assumed it would for myself as well. Not so. I can't really speak about any side effects as I didn't use it long enough. I couldn't tell I had taken anything...the pain was still too bad.

I'm a severe case since age 10; started using this as soon as it was legal here (10 yrs?) and it is the only thing that has ever worked. In 20 mins I am free of pain regardless of intensity, although during that 20 mins there is strong tingling, sleepiness and malaise but who cares?? I use around 12 shots per month. Tablets do not work at all for me."

Overall, though, I don't know what I'd do without it. Oddly, seems to work best for me if I take it when the headache is really bad, as opposed to at the onset as suggested. But, I often have different reactions to drugs than expected."

It's only worked once in the past year and it comes with such horrible side effects -- fluttering in the chest, intense tightening of the back neck muscles, etc. A hot washcloth over the eyes in a blacked-out room works better than this expensive stuff."
9/5/2002 3:22:42 AM,1 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Doesn't Work I used this product for several years with no success. The product does not provide any relief and is very expensive. I've tried both the tablets and nasal spray. I've had better success with hot packs on my head, ice packs on my neck and a dark room. I'm now using Frova and it seems to be working great."

8/29/2002 2:09:42 PM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imitrex injections are the easiest of the triptans Imitrex injections are the easiest of the triptans for me to administer when I have a full-blown migraine with nausea, since I don't need to swallow a pill. The disolving tablets don't work for me, since Nutrasweet is one of my triggers. So, if you don't mind injecting yourself (the kit makes it really easy), this form of Imitrex is fast and easy (I have to admit, I haven't tried the nasal spray yet). Still, Imitrex doesn't last as long as Zomig, and you are allowed only one shot in 24 hours, so when it wears off, you have to take something else, or suffer."

6/8/2002 3:24:29 AM,3.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imetrex Could not survive without this! I've been using Imetrex injections for 10 years for hormonal migraines. It is THE ONLY DRUG that EVER worked for me. Side effects vary depending on the time of day. If I shoot up in the morning, I feel dopey and tired for about an hour and then that's gone. The later in the day it gets, the longer the side effects last. What is scary is that this drug constricts EVERY blood vessel in your body. The older I get, the more I am concerned about possible heart attack. There's got to be a better way, for my type of migraines (hormone therapy makes them WORSE!) I pay $25.00 per 2 shot kit. My insurance picks up the rest"
5/15/2002 1:38:09 AM,1.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Hit or Miss I have terrible migraine headaches, and so far Imitrex has been somewhat effective one time. Other times, not at all effective. I would say the effectiveness is surpassed by many boiling hot washcloths on the forehead, a completely dark room, an ice pack on the neck, and deep relaxation. It didn't stop the vomiting. This isn't to say it may not work for some people; however, I don't think it works for me. One side effect is that my breathing becomes quite shallow (I'm not sure if I'm becoming sleepy or not)."
6/27/2001 1:32:24 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imitrex Injectable I've tried Imitrex in all three forms - tablets, nasal spray and injectable. Only the injectable works immediately (within 10 minutes) and without rebound. Very expensive if you don't have insurance to cover purchase, which is short-sighted public policy given the cost to economies all over the world of lost productivity due to migraines. Also, not everyone can tolerate Imitrex, so I feel very fortunate that I can, and that it works beautifully every time. I would strongly suggest that, if you've never used the injectable, you get the first shot at your physician's office or some other setting where you'll be monitored by a health care provider."

I can take one and lie down and rest for an hour or two and then my headache is either gone or almost gone. After I take it, I usually feel sort of sick the rest of the day but it's much better than having a migraine. I used the nasal spray once and it didn't work for me. I've never tried the injection."

4/16/2001 8:10:48 PM,4.5 Stars,Rated  for Migraine Report ,"Imitrex Injections I give myself Imitrex injections for migraines. If caught early enough, the shot does the trick and the migraine is gone. The only catch is that you have to take the shot as soon as syptoms appear and for about 30 minutes after taking the shot, I feel like I'm having a heart attack. It sounds awful, but it beats a 3-5 day migraine!"
